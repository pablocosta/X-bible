NIRV	Genesis	1	1	In the beginning , God created the heavens and the earth .
NIRV	Genesis	1	2	The earth didn ’ t have any shape . And it was empty . There was darkness over the surface of the waves . At that time , the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters .
NIRV	Genesis	1	3	God said , “ Let there be light. ” And there was light .
NIRV	Genesis	1	4	God saw that the light was good . He separated the light from the darkness .
NIRV	Genesis	1	5	God called the light “ day. ” He called the darkness “ night. ” There was evening , and there was morning . It was day one .
NIRV	Genesis	1	6	God said , “ Let there be a huge space between the waters . Let it separate water from water. ”
NIRV	Genesis	1	7	And that ’ s exactly what happened . God made the huge space between the waters . He separated the water under the space from the water above it .
NIRV	Genesis	1	8	God called the huge space “ sky. ” There was evening , and there was morning . It was day two .
NIRV	Genesis	1	9	God said , “ Let the water under the sky be gathered into one place . Let dry ground appear. ” And that ’ s exactly what happened .
NIRV	Genesis	1	10	God called the dry ground “ land. ” He called all the water that was gathered together “ seas. ” And God saw that it was good .
NIRV	Genesis	1	11	Then God said , “ Let the land produce plants . Let them produce their own seeds . And let there be trees on the land that grow fruit with seeds in it . Let each kind of plant or tree have its own kind of seeds. ” And that ’ s exactly what happened .
NIRV	Genesis	1	12	So the land produced plants . Each kind of plant had its own kind of seeds . And the land produced trees that grew fruit with seeds in it . Each kind of tree had its own kind of seeds . God saw that it was good .
NIRV	Genesis	1	13	There was evening , and there was morning . It was day three .
NIRV	Genesis	1	14	God said , “ Let there be lights in the huge space of the sky . Let them separate the day from the night . Let the lights set the times for the holy celebrations and the days and the years .
NIRV	Genesis	1	15	Let them be lights in the huge space of the sky to give light on the earth. ” And that ’ s exactly what happened .
NIRV	Genesis	1	16	God made two great lights . He made the larger light to rule over the day and the smaller light to rule over the night . He also made the stars .
NIRV	Genesis	1	17	God put the lights in the huge space of the sky to give light on the earth .
NIRV	Genesis	1	18	He put them there to rule over the day and the night . He put them there to separate light from darkness . God saw that it was good .
NIRV	Genesis	1	19	There was evening , and there was morning . It was day four .
NIRV	Genesis	1	20	God said , “ Let the seas be filled with living things . Let birds fly above the earth across the huge space of the sky. ”
NIRV	Genesis	1	21	So God created the great sea creatures . He created every kind of living thing that fills the seas and moves about in them . He created every kind of bird that flies . And God saw that it was good .
NIRV	Genesis	1	22	God blessed them . He said , “ Have little ones so that there will be many of you . Fill the water in the seas . Let there be more and more birds on the earth. ”
NIRV	Genesis	1	23	There was evening , and there was morning . It was day five .
NIRV	Genesis	1	24	God said , “ Let the land produce every kind of living creature . Let there be livestock , and creatures that move along the ground , and wild animals. ” And that ’ s exactly what happened .
NIRV	Genesis	1	25	God made every kind of wild animal . He made every kind of livestock . He made every kind of creature that moves along the ground . And God saw that it was good .
NIRV	Genesis	1	26	Then God said , “ Let us make human beings so that they are like us . Let them rule over the fish in the seas and the birds in the sky . Let them rule over the livestock and all the wild animals . And let them rule over all the creatures that move along the ground. ”
NIRV	Genesis	1	27	So God created human beings in his own likeness . He created them to be like himself . He created them as male and female .
NIRV	Genesis	1	28	God blessed them . He said to them , “ Have children so that there will be many of you . Fill the earth and bring it under your control . Rule over the fish in the seas and the birds in the sky . Rule over every living creature that moves along the ground. ”
NIRV	Genesis	1	29	Then God said , “ I am giving you every plant on the face of the whole earth that produces its own seeds . I am giving you every tree that has fruit with seeds in it . All of them will be given to you for food .
NIRV	Genesis	1	30	I am giving every green plant as food for all the land animals and for all the birds in the sky . I am also giving the plants to all the creatures that move along the ground . I am giving them to every living thing that breathes. ” And that ’ s exactly what happened .
NIRV	Genesis	1	31	God saw everything he had made . And it was very good . There was evening , and there was morning . It was day six . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	2	2	By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing . So on that day he rested from all his work .
NIRV	Genesis	2	3	God blessed the seventh day and made it holy . He blessed it because on that day he rested from all the work he had done . Adam and Eve
NIRV	Genesis	2	4	Here is the story of the heavens and the earth when they were created . The Lord God made the earth and the heavens .
NIRV	Genesis	2	5	At that time , bushes had not yet appeared on the earth . Plants had not started to grow . The Lord God had not sent rain on the earth . And there was no one to farm the land .
NIRV	Genesis	2	6	But streams came from the earth . They watered the entire surface of the ground .
NIRV	Genesis	2	7	Then the Lord God formed a man . He made him out of the dust of the ground . God breathed the breath of life into him . And the man became a living person .
NIRV	Genesis	2	8	The Lord God had planted a garden in the east in Eden . He put in the garden the man he had formed .
NIRV	Genesis	2	9	The Lord God made every kind of tree grow out of the ground . The trees were pleasing to look at . Their fruit was good to eat . There were two trees in the middle of the garden . One of them had fruit that let people live forever . The other had fruit that let people tell the difference between good and evil .
NIRV	Genesis	2	10	A river watered the garden . It flowed out of Eden . From there the river separated into four other rivers .
NIRV	Genesis	2	11	The name of the first river is the Pishon . It winds through the whole land of Havilah . Gold is found there .
NIRV	Genesis	2	12	The gold of that land is good . Onyx and sweet-smelling resin are also found there .
NIRV	Genesis	2	13	The name of the second river is the Gihon . It winds through the whole land of Cush .
NIRV	Genesis	2	14	The name of the third river is the Tigris . It runs along the east side of Ashur . And the fourth river is called the Euphrates .
NIRV	Genesis	2	15	The Lord God put the man in the Garden of Eden . He put him there to farm its land and take care of it .
NIRV	Genesis	2	16	The Lord God gave the man a command . He said , “ You may eat fruit from any tree in the garden .
NIRV	Genesis	2	17	But you must not eat the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil . If you do , you will certainly die. ”
NIRV	Genesis	2	18	The Lord God said , “ It is not good for the man to be alone . I will make a helper who is just right for him. ”
NIRV	Genesis	2	19	The Lord God had formed all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky . He had made all of them out of the ground . He brought them to the man to see what names he would give them . And the name the man gave each living creature became its name .
NIRV	Genesis	2	20	So the man gave names to all the livestock , all the birds in the sky , and all the wild animals . But Adam didn ’ t find a helper that was just right for him .
NIRV	Genesis	2	21	So the Lord God caused him to fall into a deep sleep . While the man was sleeping , the Lord God took out one of the man ’ s ribs . Then the Lord God closed the opening in the man ’ s side .
NIRV	Genesis	2	22	Then the Lord God made a woman . He made her from the rib he had taken out of the man . And the Lord God brought her to the man .
NIRV	Genesis	2	23	The man said , “ Her bones have come from my bones . Her body has come from my body . She will be named ‘ woman , ’ because she was taken out of a man. ”
NIRV	Genesis	2	24	That ’ s why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife . The two of them become one .
NIRV	Genesis	2	25	Adam and his wife were both naked . They didn ’ t feel any shame . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	3	3	But God did say , ‘ You must not eat the fruit from the tree in the middle of the garden . Do not even touch it . If you do , you will die. ’ ”
NIRV	Genesis	3	2	The woman said to the serpent , “ We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden .
NIRV	Genesis	3	4	“ You will certainly not die , ” the serpent said to the woman .
NIRV	Genesis	3	5	“ God knows that when you eat fruit from that tree , you will know things you have never known before . Like God , you will be able to tell the difference between good and evil. ”
NIRV	Genesis	3	6	The woman saw that the tree ’ s fruit was good to eat and pleasing to look at . She also saw that it would make a person wise . So she took some of the fruit and ate it . She also gave some to her husband , who was with her . And he ate it .
NIRV	Genesis	3	7	Then both of them knew things they had never known before . They realized they were naked . So they sewed together fig leaves and made clothes for themselves .
NIRV	Genesis	3	8	Then the man and his wife heard the Lord God walking in the garden . It was during the coolest time of the day . They hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden .
NIRV	Genesis	3	9	But the Lord God called out to the man . “ Where are you ? ” he asked .
NIRV	Genesis	3	10	“ I heard you in the garden , ” the man answered . “ I was afraid , because I was naked . So I hid. ”
NIRV	Genesis	3	11	The Lord God said , “ Who told you that you were naked ? Have you eaten fruit from the tree I commanded you not to eat from ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	3	12	The man said , “ It ’ s the fault of the woman you put here with me . She gave me some fruit from the tree . And I ate it. ”
NIRV	Genesis	3	13	Then the Lord God said to the woman , “ What have you done ? ” The woman said , “ The serpent tricked me . That ’ s why I ate the fruit. ”
NIRV	Genesis	3	14	So the Lord God spoke to the serpent . He said , “ Because you have done this , “ You are set apart from all livestock and all wild animals . I am putting a curse on you . You will crawl on your belly . You will eat dust all the days of your life .
NIRV	Genesis	3	15	I will make you and the woman hate each other . Your children and her children will be enemies . Her son will crush your head . And you will bite his heel. ”
NIRV	Genesis	3	16	The Lord God said to the woman , “ I will increase your pain when you give birth . You will be in great pain when you have children . You will long for your husband . And he will rule over you. ”
NIRV	Genesis	3	17	The Lord God said to Adam , “ You listened to your wife ’ s suggestion . You ate fruit from the tree I warned you about . I said , ‘ You must not eat its fruit. ’ “ So I am putting a curse on the ground because of what you did . All the days of your life you will have to work hard . It will be painful for you to get food from the ground .
NIRV	Genesis	3	18	You will eat plants from the field , even though the ground produces thorns and prickly weeds .
NIRV	Genesis	3	19	You will have to work hard and sweat a lot to produce the food you eat . You were made out of the ground . You will return to it when you die . You are dust , and you will return to dust. ”
NIRV	Genesis	3	20	Adam named his wife Eve . She would become the mother of every living person .
NIRV	Genesis	3	21	The Lord God made clothes out of animal skins for Adam and his wife to wear .
NIRV	Genesis	3	22	The Lord God said , “ Just like one of us , the man can now tell the difference between good and evil . He must not be allowed to reach out and pick fruit from the tree of life and eat it . If he does , he will live forever. ”
NIRV	Genesis	3	23	So the Lord God drove the man out of the Garden of Eden . He sent the man to farm the ground he had been made from .
NIRV	Genesis	3	24	The Lord God drove him out and then placed angels on the east side of the garden . He also placed there a flaming sword that flashed back and forth . The angels and the sword guarded the way to the tree of life . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	4	4	And Abel also brought an offering . He brought the fattest parts of some animals from his flock . They were the first animals born to their mothers . The Lord was pleased with Abel and his offering .
NIRV	Genesis	4	2	Later she gave birth to his brother Abel . Abel took care of sheep . Cain farmed the land .
NIRV	Genesis	4	3	After some time , Cain gathered some things he had grown . He brought them as an offering to the Lord .
NIRV	Genesis	4	5	But he wasn ’ t pleased with Cain and his offering . So Cain became very angry , and his face was sad .
NIRV	Genesis	4	6	Then the Lord said to Cain , “ Why are you angry ? Why are you looking so sad ?
NIRV	Genesis	4	7	Do what is right and then you will be accepted . If you don ’ t do what is right , sin is waiting at your door to grab you . It desires to control you . But you must rule over it. ”
NIRV	Genesis	4	8	Cain said to his brother Abel , “ Let ’ s go out to the field. ” So they went out . There Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him .
NIRV	Genesis	4	9	Then the Lord said to Cain , “ Where is your brother Abel ? ” “ I don ’ t know , ” Cain replied . “ Am I supposed to take care of my brother ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	4	10	The Lord said , “ What have you done ? Listen ! Your brother ’ s blood is crying out to me from the ground .
NIRV	Genesis	4	11	So I am putting a curse on you . I am driving you away from this ground . It has opened its mouth to receive your brother ’ s blood from your hand .
NIRV	Genesis	4	12	When you farm the land , it will not produce its crops for you anymore . You will be a restless person who wanders around on the earth. ”
NIRV	Genesis	4	13	Cain said to the Lord , “ You are punishing me more than I can take .
NIRV	Genesis	4	14	Today you are driving me away from the land . I will be hidden from you . I ’ ll be a restless person who wanders around on the earth . Anyone who finds me will kill me. ”
NIRV	Genesis	4	15	But the Lord said to him , “ No . Anyone who kills you will be paid back seven times. ” The Lord put a mark on Cain . Then anyone who found him wouldn ’ t kill him .
NIRV	Genesis	4	16	So Cain went away from the Lord . He lived in the land of Nod . It was east of Eden .
NIRV	Genesis	4	17	Cain loved his wife and slept with her . She became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch . At that time Cain was building a city . He named it after his son Enoch .

NIRV	Genesis	4	21	His brother ’ s name was Jubal . He was the father of everyone who plays stringed instruments and wind instruments .
NIRV	Genesis	4	22	Zillah also had a son . His name was Tubal-Cain . He made all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron . Tubal-Cain ’ s sister was Naamah .
NIRV	Genesis	4	23	Lamech said to his wives , “ Adah and Zillah , listen to me ! You wives of Lamech , hear my words ! I have killed a man because he wounded me . I have killed a young man because he hurt me .
NIRV	Genesis	4	24	Anyone who would have killed Cain would have been paid back seven times . But anyone who hurts me will be paid back
NIRV	Genesis	4	77	times. ”
NIRV	Genesis	4	25	Adam slept with his wife again . She gave birth to a son and named him Seth . She said , “ God has given me another child . He will take the place of Abel , because Cain killed him. ”
NIRV	Genesis	4	26	Seth also had a son and named him Enosh . Then people began to call on the name of the Lord . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	8	9	But the dove couldn ’ t find any place to rest . Water still covered the whole surface of the earth . So the dove returned to Noah in the ark . Noah reached out his hand and took the dove in . He brought it back to himself in the ark .
NIRV	Genesis	8	10	He waited seven more days . Then he sent out the dove again from the ark .
NIRV	Genesis	8	11	In the evening the dove returned to him . There in its beak was a freshly picked olive leaf ! So Noah knew that the water on the earth had gone down .
NIRV	Genesis	8	12	He waited seven more days . Then he sent out the dove again . But this time it didn ’ t return to him .
NIRV	Genesis	8	13	It was the first day of the first month of Noah ’ s 601st year . The water on the earth had dried up . Then Noah removed the covering from the ark . He saw that the surface of the ground was dry .

NIRV	Genesis	8	17	Bring out every kind of living thing that is with you . Bring the birds , the animals , and all the creatures that move along the ground . Then they can multiply on the earth . They can have little ones and the number of them can increase. ”

NIRV	Genesis	8	19	All the animals came out of the ark . The creatures that move along the ground also came out . So did all the birds . Everything that moves on land came out of the ark , one kind after another .

NIRV	Genesis	8	21	The smell of the offerings pleased the Lord . He said to himself , “ I will never put a curse on the ground again because of human beings . I will not do it even though their hearts are always directed toward evil . Their thoughts are evil from the time they are young . I will never destroy all living things again , as I have just done .

NIRV	Genesis	9	2	All the land animals will be afraid of you . All the birds in the sky will be afraid of you . Every creature that moves along the ground will be afraid of you . So will every fish in the seas . Every living thing is put under your control .
NIRV	Genesis	9	3	Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you . I have already given you the green plants for food . Now I am giving you everything .
NIRV	Genesis	9	4	“ But you must not eat meat that still has blood in it .

I am making it with all the creatures that came out of the ark with you . In fact , I am making it with every living thing on earth .
NIRV	Genesis	9	11	Here is my covenant I am making with you . The waters of a flood will never again destroy all life . A flood will never again destroy the earth. ”
NIRV	Genesis	9	12	God continued , “ My covenant is between me and you and every living creature with you . It is a covenant for all time to come . Here is the sign of the covenant I am making .
NIRV	Genesis	9	13	I have put my rainbow in the clouds . It will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth .
NIRV	Genesis	9	14	Sometimes when I bring clouds over the earth , a rainbow will appear in them .
NIRV	Genesis	9	15	Then I will remember my covenant between me and you and every kind of living creature . The waters will never again become a flood to destroy all life .
NIRV	Genesis	9	16	When the rainbow appears in the clouds , I will see it . I will remember that my covenant will last forever . It is a covenant between me and every kind of living creature on earth. ”

NIRV	Genesis	9	20	Noah was a man who farmed the land . He decided to plant a field that produced grapes for making wine .
NIRV	Genesis	9	21	When he drank some of the wine , it made him drunk . Then he lay down inside his tent without any clothes on .
NIRV	Genesis	9	22	Ham saw his father naked . Then Ham , the father of Canaan , went outside and told his two brothers .
NIRV	Genesis	9	23	But Shem and Japheth picked up a piece of clothing and laid it across their shoulders . Then they walked backward into the tent . They covered their father ’ s body . They turned their faces away because they didn ’ t want to see their father naked .
NIRV	Genesis	9	24	Then Noah woke up from his sleep that was caused by the wine . He found out what his youngest son had done to him .
NIRV	Genesis	9	25	He said , “ May a curse be put on Canaan ! He will be the lowest of slaves to his brothers. ”
NIRV	Genesis	9	26	Noah also said , “ May the Lord , the God of Shem , be praised . May Canaan be the slave of Shem .
NIRV	Genesis	9	27	May God add land to Japheth ’ s territory . May Japheth live in the tents of Shem . And may Canaan be the slave of Japheth. ”

NIRV	Genesis	15	12	As the sun was going down , Abram fell into a deep sleep . A thick and scary darkness covered him .
NIRV	Genesis	15	13	Then the Lord said to him , “ You can be sure of what I am about to tell you . For
NIRV	Genesis	15	400	years , your family who comes after you will be strangers in another country . They will become slaves there and will be treated badly .
NIRV	Genesis	15	14	But I will punish the nation that makes them slaves . After that , they will leave with many possessions .
NIRV	Genesis	15	16	Your children ’ s grandchildren will come back here . That ’ s because the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached the point where I must punish them. ”
NIRV	Genesis	15	17	The sun set and it became dark . Then a burning torch and a pot filled with smoking coals appeared . They passed between the pieces of the animals that had been cut in two .
NIRV	Genesis	15	18	On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram . He said , “ I am giving this land to your family who comes after you . It reaches from the River of Egypt to the great Euphrates River .
NIRV	Genesis	15	19	It includes the land of the Kenites , Kenizzites , Kadmonites ,
NIRV	Genesis	15	20	Hittites , Perizzites and Rephaites .
NIRV	Genesis	15	21	The Amorites , Canaanites , Girgashites and Jebusites also live there. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	16	16	Abram was
NIRV	Genesis	16	2	So she said to Abram , “ The Lord has kept me from having children . Go and sleep with my slave . Maybe I can have a family through her. ” Abram agreed to what Sarai had said .
NIRV	Genesis	16	3	His wife Sarai gave him her slave Hagar to be his wife . That was after he had been living in Canaan for ten years .
NIRV	Genesis	16	4	Then he slept with Hagar , and she became pregnant . When Hagar knew she was pregnant , she began to look down on the woman who owned her .
NIRV	Genesis	16	5	Then Sarai said to Abram , “ It ’ s your fault that I ’ m suffering like this . I put my slave in your arms . Now that she knows she ’ s pregnant , she looks down on me . May the Lord judge between you and me . May he decide which of us is right. ”
NIRV	Genesis	16	6	“ Your slave belongs to you , ” Abram said . “ Do with her what you think is best. ” Then Sarai treated Hagar badly . So Hagar ran away from her .
NIRV	Genesis	16	7	The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring of water in the desert . The spring was beside the road to Shur .
NIRV	Genesis	16	8	The angel said , “ Hagar , you are Sarai ’ s slave . Where have you come from ? Where are you going ? ” “ I ’ m running away from my owner Sarai , ” she answered .
NIRV	Genesis	16	9	Then the angel of the Lord told her , “ Go back to the woman who owns you . Obey her. ”
NIRV	Genesis	16	10	The angel continued , “ I will give you and your family many children . There will be more of them than anyone can count. ”
NIRV	Genesis	16	11	The angel of the Lord also said to her , “ You are now pregnant and will have a son . You will name him Ishmael , because the Lord has heard about your suffering .
NIRV	Genesis	16	12	He will be like a wild donkey . He will use his power against everyone , and everyone will be against him . He will not get along with any of his family. ”
NIRV	Genesis	16	13	She gave a name to the Lord who spoke to her . She called him “ You are the God who sees me. ” That ’ s because she said , “ I have now seen the One who sees me. ”
NIRV	Genesis	16	14	That ’ s why the well was named Beer Lahai Roi . It ’ s still there , between Kadesh and Bered .
NIRV	Genesis	16	15	So Hagar had a son by Abram and Abram gave him the name Ishmael .

NIRV	Genesis	17	17	Abraham fell with his face to the ground . He laughed and said to himself , “ Can a 100-year-old man have a son ? Can Sarah have a child at the age of
NIRV	Genesis	17	99	years old when he was circumcised .
NIRV	Genesis	17	2	I will now act on my covenant between me and you . I will greatly increase the number of your children after you. ”
NIRV	Genesis	17	3	Abram fell with his face to the ground . God said to him ,
NIRV	Genesis	17	4	“ This is my covenant with you . You will be the father of many nations .
NIRV	Genesis	17	5	You will not be called Abram anymore . Your name will be Abraham , because I have made you a father of many nations .
NIRV	Genesis	17	6	I will greatly increase the number of your children after you . Nations and kings will come from you .

NIRV	Genesis	17	9	Then God said to Abraham , “ You must keep my covenant . You and your family after you must keep it for all time to come .
NIRV	Genesis	17	10	Here is my covenant that you and your family after you must keep . You and every male among you must be circumcised .

NIRV	Genesis	17	13	.
NIRV	Genesis	17	14	Any male who has not been circumcised will be separated from his people . He has broken my covenant. ”
NIRV	Genesis	17	15	God also said to Abraham , “ Do not continue to call your wife by the name Sarai . Her name will be Sarah .
NIRV	Genesis	17	16	I will give her my blessing . You can be sure that I will give you a son by her . I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations . Kings of nations will come from her. ”
NIRV	Genesis	17	90	? ”
NIRV	Genesis	17	18	Abraham said to God , “ I really wish Ishmael could receive your blessing ! ”
NIRV	Genesis	17	19	Then God said , “ Yes , I will bless Ishmael . But your wife Sarah will have a son by you . And you will name him Isaac . I will establish my covenant with him . That covenant will last forever . It will be for Isaac and his family after him .
NIRV	Genesis	17	20	I have heard what you said about Ishmael . I will surely bless him . I will make his family very large . He will be the father of
NIRV	Genesis	17	21	But I will establish my covenant with Isaac . By this time next year , Sarah will have a son by you. ”
NIRV	Genesis	17	22	When God had finished speaking with Abraham , God left him .
NIRV	Genesis	17	23	On that same day Abraham circumcised his son Ishmael . He also circumcised every male who was born into his family or bought with his money . He did exactly as God had told him .

NIRV	Genesis	18	18	He will certainly become a great and powerful nation . All nations on earth will be blessed because of him .
NIRV	Genesis	18	2	Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby . So he quickly left the entrance to his tent to greet them . He bowed low to the ground .
NIRV	Genesis	18	3	He said , “ My lord , if you are pleased with me , don ’ t pass me by .
NIRV	Genesis	18	4	Let me get you some water . Then all of you can wash your feet and rest under this tree .
NIRV	Genesis	18	5	Let me get you something to eat to give you strength . Then you can go on your way . I want to do this for you now that you have come to me. ” “ All right , ” they answered . “ Do as you say. ”
NIRV	Genesis	18	6	So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah . “ Quick ! ” he said . “ Get about
NIRV	Genesis	18	36	pounds of the finest flour . Prepare it and bake some bread. ”
NIRV	Genesis	18	7	Then he ran over to the herd . He picked out a choice , tender calf . He gave it to a servant , who hurried to prepare it .
NIRV	Genesis	18	8	Then he brought some butter and milk and the calf that had been prepared . He served them to the three men . While they ate , he stood near them under a tree .
NIRV	Genesis	18	9	“ Where is your wife Sarah ? ” they asked him . “ Over there in the tent , ” he said .
NIRV	Genesis	18	10	Then one of them said , “ I will surely return to you about this time next year . Your wife Sarah will have a son. ” Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent , which was behind him .
NIRV	Genesis	18	11	Abraham and Sarah were already very old . Sarah was too old to have a baby .
NIRV	Genesis	18	12	So she laughed to herself . She thought , “ I ’ m worn out , and my husband is old . Can I really know the joy of having a baby ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	18	13	Then the Lord said to Abraham , “ Why did Sarah laugh ? Why did she say , ‘ Will I really have a baby , now that I am old ? ’
NIRV	Genesis	18	14	Is anything too hard for me ? I will return to you at the appointed time next year . Sarah will have a son. ”
NIRV	Genesis	18	15	Sarah was afraid . So she lied and said , “ I didn ’ t laugh. ” But the Lord said , “ Yes , you laughed. ” Abraham Pleads for Sodom
NIRV	Genesis	18	16	The men got up to leave . They looked down toward Sodom . Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way .
NIRV	Genesis	18	17	Then the Lord said , “ Should I hide from Abraham what I am about to do ?
NIRV	Genesis	18	19	I have chosen him . He must direct his children to live in the way that pleases me . And he must direct the members of his family after him to do the same . So he must guide all of them in doing what is right and fair . Then I , the Lord , will do for Abraham what I have promised him. ”
NIRV	Genesis	18	20	, I will not destroy it. ”
NIRV	Genesis	18	21	that I will go down and see for myself . I want to see if what they have done is as bad as the cries that have reached me . If it is not , then I will know. ”
NIRV	Genesis	18	22	The men turned away and went toward Sodom . But Abraham remained standing in front of the Lord .
NIRV	Genesis	18	23	Then Abraham came up to him . He said , “ Will you sweep away godly people along with those who are evil ?
NIRV	Genesis	18	24	What if there are
NIRV	Genesis	18	50	? Will you destroy the whole city because there are five fewer people ? ” “ If I find
NIRV	Genesis	18	25	You would never kill godly people along with those who are evil , would you ? Would you treat them all alike ? You would never do anything like that ! Won ’ t the Judge of the whole earth do what is right ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	18	26	The Lord said , “ If I find

NIRV	Genesis	18	28	What if the number of godly people is five fewer than
NIRV	Genesis	18	45	there , ” he said , “ I will not destroy it. ”
NIRV	Genesis	18	29	Once again Abraham spoke to him . He asked , “ What if only
NIRV	Genesis	18	40	, I will not do it. ”
NIRV	Genesis	18	30	, I will not do it. ”
NIRV	Genesis	18	31	Abraham said , “ I have been very bold to speak to the Lord . What if only
NIRV	Genesis	18	32	Then he said , “ Lord , please don ’ t be angry with me . Let me speak just one more time . What if only ten can be found there ? ” He answered , “ If I find ten , I will not destroy it. ”

NIRV	Genesis	19	19	You have done me a big favor . You have been very kind to me by sparing my life . But I can ’ t run to the mountains . I won ’ t be able to escape this horrible thing that ’ s going to happen . And then I ’ ll die .
NIRV	Genesis	19	2	“ My lords , ” he said , “ please come to my house . You can wash your feet and spend the night there . Then you can go on your way early in the morning. ” “ No , ” they answered . “ We ’ ll spend the night in the town square. ”
NIRV	Genesis	19	3	But Lot wouldn ’ t give up . So they went with him and entered his house . He prepared a meal for them . He baked bread without using yeast . And they ate .
NIRV	Genesis	19	4	Before Lot and his guests had gone to bed , all the men came from every part of the city of Sodom . Young and old men alike surrounded the house .
NIRV	Genesis	19	5	They called out to Lot . They said , “ Where are the men who came to you tonight ? Bring them out to us . We want to have sex with them. ”
NIRV	Genesis	19	6	Lot went outside to meet them . He shut the door behind him .
NIRV	Genesis	19	7	He said , “ No , my friends . Don ’ t do such an evil thing .
NIRV	Genesis	19	8	Look , I have two daughters that no man has ever slept with . I ’ ll bring them out to you now . Then do to them what you want to . But don ’ t do anything to these men . I ’ ve brought them inside so they can be safe. ”
NIRV	Genesis	19	9	“ Get out of our way ! ” the men of Sodom replied to Lot . “ You came here as an outsider . Now you want to act like a judge ! We ’ ll treat you worse than them. ” They kept trying to force Lot to open the door . Then they moved forward to break it down .
NIRV	Genesis	19	10	But the the angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door .
NIRV	Genesis	19	11	Then they made the men who were at the door of the house blind . They blinded both young and old men so that they couldn ’ t find the door .
NIRV	Genesis	19	12	The two angels said to Lot , “ Do you have any other family members here ? Do you have sons-in-law , sons , daughters or any other relatives in the city ? Get them out of here !
NIRV	Genesis	19	13	We are going to destroy this place . Many have cried out to the Lord against the people of this city . So he has sent us to destroy it. ”
NIRV	Genesis	19	14	Then Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law . They had promised to marry his daughters . He said , “ Hurry up ! Get out of this place ! The Lord is about to destroy the city ! ” But his sons-in-law thought he was joking .
NIRV	Genesis	19	15	The sun was coming up . So the angels tried to get Lot to leave . They said , “ Hurry up ! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here . Get out ! If you don ’ t , you will be swept away when the city is destroyed. ”
NIRV	Genesis	19	16	Lot didn ’ t move right away . So the men grabbed him by the hand . They also took hold of the hands of his wife and two daughters . They led all of them safely out of the city . The Lord had mercy on them .
NIRV	Genesis	19	17	As soon as the angels had brought them out , one of them spoke . He said , “ Run for your lives ! Don ’ t look back ! Don ’ t stop anywhere in the valley ! Run to the mountains ! If you don ’ t , you will be swept away ! ”
NIRV	Genesis	19	18	But Lot said to them , “ No , my lords ! Please !
NIRV	Genesis	19	20	Look , here ’ s a town near enough to run to . It ’ s small . Let me run to it . It ’ s very small , isn ’ t it ? Then my life will be spared. ”
NIRV	Genesis	19	21	The Lord said to Lot , “ All right . I will also give you what you are asking for . I will not destroy the town you are talking about .
NIRV	Genesis	19	22	But run there quickly . I can ’ t do anything until you reach it. ” The town was named Zoar . Zoar means Small .
NIRV	Genesis	19	23	By the time Lot reached Zoar , the sun had risen over the land .
NIRV	Genesis	19	24	Then the Lord sent down burning sulfur . It came down like rain on Sodom and Gomorrah . It came from the Lord . It came out of the sky .
NIRV	Genesis	19	25	The Lord destroyed these cities and the whole valley . All the people who were living in the cities were wiped out . So were the plants in the land .
NIRV	Genesis	19	26	But Lot ’ s wife looked back . When she did , she became a pillar made out of salt .
NIRV	Genesis	19	27	Early the next morning Abraham got up . He returned to the place where he had stood in front of the Lord .
NIRV	Genesis	19	28	He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and the whole valley . He saw thick smoke rising from the land . It looked like smoke from a furnace .
NIRV	Genesis	19	29	So when God destroyed the cities of the valley , he showed concern for Abraham . He brought Lot out safely when he destroyed the cities where Lot had lived . Lot and His Daughters
NIRV	Genesis	19	30	Lot and his two daughters left Zoar . They went to live in the mountains because Lot was afraid to stay in Zoar . So he and his daughters lived in a cave .
NIRV	Genesis	19	31	One day the older daughter spoke to the younger one . She said , “ Our father is old . People all over the earth have men to marry and have children with . We do not .
NIRV	Genesis	19	32	So let ’ s get our father to drink wine . Then we can sleep with him . We can use our father to continue our family line. ”
NIRV	Genesis	19	33	That night they got their father to drink wine . Then the older daughter went in and slept with him . He wasn ’ t aware when she lay down or when she got up .
NIRV	Genesis	19	34	The next day the older daughter spoke to the younger one again . She said , “ Last night I slept with my father . Let ’ s get him to drink wine again tonight . Then you go in and sleep with him . We can use our father to continue our family line. ”
NIRV	Genesis	19	35	So they got their father to drink wine that night also . Then the younger daughter slept with him . Again he wasn ’ t aware when she lay down or when she got up .
NIRV	Genesis	19	36	So both of Lot ’ s daughters became pregnant by their father .
NIRV	Genesis	19	37	The older daughter had a son . She named him Moab . He ’ s the father of the Moabites of today .
NIRV	Genesis	19	38	The younger daughter also had a son . She named him Ben-Ammi . He ’ s the father of the Ammonites of today . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	20	20	Abraham moved south into the Negev Desert . He lived between Kadesh and Shur . For a while he stayed in Gerar .
NIRV	Genesis	20	2	There Abraham said about his wife Sarah , “ She ’ s my sister. ” Then Abimelek , the king of Gerar , sent for Sarah and took her .
NIRV	Genesis	20	3	So God appeared to Abimelek in a dream one night . He said to him , “ You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken . She is already married. ”
NIRV	Genesis	20	4	But Abimelek hadn ’ t gone near her . So he said , “ Lord , will you destroy a nation that hasn ’ t done anything wrong ?
NIRV	Genesis	20	5	Didn ’ t Abraham say to me , ‘ She ’ s my sister ’ ? And didn ’ t she also say , ‘ He ’ s my brother ’ ? I had no idea I was doing anything wrong. ”
NIRV	Genesis	20	6	Then God spoke to him in the dream . He said , “ Yes , I know you had no idea you were doing anything wrong . So I have kept you from sinning against me . That is why I did not let you touch her .
NIRV	Genesis	20	7	Now return the man ’ s wife to him . He is a prophet . So he will pray for you , and you will live . But what if you do not return her ? Then you can be sure that you and all your people will die. ”
NIRV	Genesis	20	8	Early the next morning Abimelek sent for all his officials . When he told them everything that had happened , they were really afraid .
NIRV	Genesis	20	9	Then Abimelek called Abraham in . Abimelek said , “ What have you done to us ? Have I done something wrong to you ? Why have you brought so much guilt on me and my kingdom ? You have done things to me that should never be done. ”
NIRV	Genesis	20	10	Abimelek also asked Abraham , “ Why did you do this ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	20	11	Abraham replied , “ I thought , ‘ There is no respect for God in this place . They will kill me because of my wife. ’
NIRV	Genesis	20	12	Besides , she really is my sister . She ’ s the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother . And she became my wife .
NIRV	Genesis	20	13	God had me wander away from my father ’ s house . So I said to her , ‘ Here is how you can show your love to me . Everywhere we go , say about me , “ He ’ s my brother. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Genesis	20	14	Then Abimelek gave Abraham sheep and cattle and male and female slaves . He also returned his wife Sarah to him .
NIRV	Genesis	20	15	Abimelek said , “ Here is my land . Live anywhere you want to. ”
NIRV	Genesis	20	16	He said to Sarah , “ I ’ m giving your brother
NIRV	Genesis	20	25	pounds of silver . This will show everyone with you that I am sorry for what I did to you . You haven ’ t done anything wrong. ”
NIRV	Genesis	20	17	Then Abraham prayed to God , and God healed Abimelek . He also healed his wife and his female slaves so they could have children again .

NIRV	Genesis	21	21	While he was living in the Desert of Paran , his mother got a wife for him from Egypt . The Agreement at Beersheba
NIRV	Genesis	21	2	Sarah became pregnant . She had a son by Abraham when he was old . The child was born at the exact time God had promised .
NIRV	Genesis	21	3	Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah had by him .
NIRV	Genesis	21	4	When his son Isaac was eight days old , Abraham circumcised him . He did it exactly as God had commanded him .
NIRV	Genesis	21	5	Abraham was
NIRV	Genesis	21	100	years old when his son Isaac was born to him .
NIRV	Genesis	21	6	Sarah said , “ God has given laughter to me . Everyone who hears about this will laugh with me. ”
NIRV	Genesis	21	7	She also said , “ Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would breast-feed children ? But I ’ ve had a son by him when he is old. ” Abraham Sends Hagar and Ishmael Away
NIRV	Genesis	21	8	Isaac grew . The time came for his mother to stop breast-feeding him . On that day Abraham prepared a big celebration .
NIRV	Genesis	21	9	But Sarah saw Ishmael making fun of Isaac . Ishmael was the son Hagar had by Abraham . Hagar was Sarah ’ s Egyptian slave .
NIRV	Genesis	21	10	Sarah said to Abraham , “ Get rid of that slave woman ! Get rid of her son ! That woman ’ s son will never have a share of the family ’ s property . All of it belongs to my son Isaac. ”
NIRV	Genesis	21	11	What Sarah said upset Abraham very much . After all , Ishmael was his son .
NIRV	Genesis	21	12	But God said to Abraham , “ Do not be so upset about the boy and your slave Hagar . Listen to what Sarah tells you , because your family line will continue through Isaac .
NIRV	Genesis	21	13	I will also make the son of your slave into a nation . I will do it because he is your child. ”
NIRV	Genesis	21	14	Early the next morning Abraham got some food and a bottle of water . The bottle was made out of animal skin . He gave the food and water to Hagar , placing them on her shoulders . Then he sent her away with the boy . She went on her way and wandered in the Desert of Beersheba .
NIRV	Genesis	21	15	When the water in the bottle was gone , she put the boy under a bush .
NIRV	Genesis	21	16	Then she sat down about as far away as a person can shoot an arrow . She thought , “ I can ’ t stand to watch the boy die. ” As she sat there , she began to sob .
NIRV	Genesis	21	17	God heard the boy crying . Then the angel of God called out to Hagar from heaven . He said to her , “ What is the matter , Hagar ? Do not be afraid . God has heard the boy crying as he lies there .
NIRV	Genesis	21	18	Lift up the boy and take him by the hand . I will make him into a great nation. ”
NIRV	Genesis	21	19	Then God opened Hagar ’ s eyes , and she saw a well of water . So she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the boy a drink .
NIRV	Genesis	21	20	God was with the boy as he grew up . He lived in the desert and learned to shoot a bow and arrow .
NIRV	Genesis	21	22	At that time Abimelek and his army commander , Phicol , spoke to Abraham . They said to Abraham , “ God is with you in everything you do .
NIRV	Genesis	21	23	Now make a promise to me here while God is watching . Give me your word that you will treat me fairly . Promise that you will treat my children and their children the same way . I ’ ve been kind to you . Now you be kind to me and the country where you are living as an outsider. ”
NIRV	Genesis	21	24	Abraham said , “ I give you my word that I ’ ll do it. ”
NIRV	Genesis	21	25	Then Abraham complained to Abimelek that his servants had taken over a well of water .
NIRV	Genesis	21	26	But Abimelek said , “ I don ’ t know who has done this . You didn ’ t tell me . And today is the first time I heard about it. ”
NIRV	Genesis	21	27	So Abraham gave Abimelek sheep and cattle . The two men came to an agreement .
NIRV	Genesis	21	28	Then Abraham picked out seven female lambs from his flock .
NIRV	Genesis	21	29	Abimelek asked Abraham , “ What ’ s the meaning of these seven female lambs ? Why have you picked them out and set them apart ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	21	30	Abraham replied , “ Accept the seven lambs from me . They will be a witness that I dug this well. ”
NIRV	Genesis	21	31	So that place was named Beersheba . That ’ s because there the two men came to an agreement .
NIRV	Genesis	21	32	After the agreement had been made at Beersheba , Abimelek went back to the land of the Philistines . His army commander , Phicol , went with him .
NIRV	Genesis	21	33	Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba . There he called on the name of the Lord , the God who lives forever .

NIRV	Genesis	22	2	Then God said , “ Take your son , your only son . He is the one you love . Take Isaac . Go to the place called Moriah . Give your son to me there as a burnt offering . Sacrifice him on the mountain I will show you. ”
NIRV	Genesis	22	3	Early the next morning Abraham got up and loaded his donkey . He took two of his servants and his son Isaac with him . He cut enough wood for the burnt offering . Then he started out for the place God had shown him .
NIRV	Genesis	22	4	On the third day Abraham saw the place a long way off .
NIRV	Genesis	22	5	He said to his servants , “ Stay here with the donkey . I and the boy will go over there and worship . Then we ’ ll come back to you. ”
NIRV	Genesis	22	6	Abraham had his son Isaac carry the wood for the burnt offering . He himself carried the fire and the knife . And the two of them walked on together .
NIRV	Genesis	22	7	Then Isaac said to his father Abraham , “ Father ? ” “ Yes , my son ? ” Abraham replied . “ The fire and wood are here , ” Isaac said . “ But where is the lamb for the burnt offering ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	22	8	Abraham answered , “ God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering , my son. ” And the two of them walked on together .
NIRV	Genesis	22	9	They reached the place God had shown Abraham . There Abraham built an altar . He arranged the wood on it . He tied up his son Isaac . Abraham placed him on the altar , on top of the wood .
NIRV	Genesis	22	10	Then he reached out his hand . He picked up the knife to kill his son .
NIRV	Genesis	22	11	But the angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven . He said , “ Abraham ! Abraham ! ” “ Here I am , ” Abraham replied .
NIRV	Genesis	22	12	“ Do not lay a hand on the boy , ” he said . “ Do not harm him . Now I know that you would do anything for God . You have not held back from me your son , your only son. ”
NIRV	Genesis	22	13	Abraham looked around . There in a bush he saw a ram caught by its horns . He went over and took the ram . He sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son .
NIRV	Genesis	22	14	So Abraham named that place The Lord Will Provide . To this day people say , “ It will be provided on the mountain of the Lord. ”
NIRV	Genesis	22	15	The angel of the Lord called out to Abraham from heaven a second time .
NIRV	Genesis	22	16	He said , “ I am giving you my word that I will bless you . I will bless you because of what you have done , ” announces the Lord . “ You have not held back your son , your only son .
NIRV	Genesis	22	17	So I will certainly bless you . I will make the children born into your family as many as the stars in the sky . I will make them as many as the grains of sand on the seashore . They will take over the cities of their enemies .
NIRV	Genesis	22	18	All nations on earth will be blessed because of your children . All these things will happen because you have obeyed me. ”
NIRV	Genesis	22	19	Then Abraham returned to his servants . They started out together for Beersheba . And Abraham stayed in Beersheba . Nahor ’ s Sons
NIRV	Genesis	22	20	Some time later Abraham was told , “ Milkah has become a mother . She has had sons by your brother Nahor .
NIRV	Genesis	22	21	Uz was born first . Then came his brother Buz . Kemuel was born next . He became the father of Aram .
NIRV	Genesis	22	23	Bethuel became the father of Rebekah . Milkah had the eight sons by Abraham ’ s brother Nahor .
NIRV	Genesis	22	24	Nahor had a concubine named Reumah . She also had sons . They were Tebah , Gaham , Tahash and Maakah . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	23	23	Sarah lived to be
NIRV	Genesis	23	127	years old .
NIRV	Genesis	23	2	She died at Kiriath Arba . Kiriath Arba is also called Hebron . It ’ s in the land of Canaan . Sarah ’ s death made Abraham very sad . He went to the place where her body was lying . There he wept over her .
NIRV	Genesis	23	3	Then Abraham got up from beside his wife ’ s body . He said to the Hittites ,
NIRV	Genesis	23	4	“ I ’ m an outsider . I ’ m a stranger among you . Sell me some property where I can bury those in my family who die . Then I can bury my wife. ”
NIRV	Genesis	23	5	The Hittites replied to Abraham ,
NIRV	Genesis	23	6	“ Sir , listen to us . You are a mighty prince among us . Bury your wife in the best place we have to bury our dead . None of us will refuse to sell you a place to bury her. ”
NIRV	Genesis	23	7	Then Abraham bowed down in front of the Hittites , the people of the land .
NIRV	Genesis	23	8	He said to them , “ If you are willing to let me bury my wife , then listen to me . Speak to Zohar ’ s son Ephron for me .
NIRV	Genesis	23	9	Ask him to sell me the cave of Machpelah . It belongs to him and is at the end of his field . Ask him to sell it to me for the full price . I want it as a place to bury my dead wife among you. ”
NIRV	Genesis	23	10	Ephron the Hittite was sitting there among his people . He replied to Abraham . All of the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city heard him .
NIRV	Genesis	23	11	“ No , sir , ” Ephron said . “ Listen to me . I will give you the field . I ’ ll also give you the cave that ’ s in the field . I will give it to you in front of my people . Bury your wife. ”
NIRV	Genesis	23	12	Again Abraham bowed down in front of the people of the land .
NIRV	Genesis	23	13	He spoke to Ephron so they could hear him . He said , “ Please listen to me . I ’ ll pay the price of the field . Accept it from me . Then I can bury my wife there. ”
NIRV	Genesis	23	14	Ephron answered Abraham ,
NIRV	Genesis	23	15	“ Sir , listen to me . The land is worth ten pounds of silver . But what ’ s that between the two of us ? Bury your wife. ”
NIRV	Genesis	23	16	Abraham agreed to Ephron ’ s offer . He weighed out for Ephron the price he had named . The Hittites there had heard the amount . The price was ten pounds of silver . Abraham measured it by the weights that were used by merchants .
NIRV	Genesis	23	17	So Ephron sold his field to Abraham . The field was in Machpelah near Mamre . Abraham bought the field and the cave that was in it . He also bought all the trees that were inside the borders of the field . Everything was sold
NIRV	Genesis	23	18	to Abraham as his property . He bought it in front of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city .
NIRV	Genesis	23	19	Then Abraham buried his wife Sarah . He buried her in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre in the land of Canaan . Mamre is at Hebron .
NIRV	Genesis	23	20	So the field and the cave that was in it were sold to Abraham by the Hittites . The property became a place to bury those who died in his family . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	24	24	She answered , “ I ’ m the daughter of Bethuel . He ’ s the son Milkah had by Nahor. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	2	The best servant in his house was in charge of everything Abraham had . Abraham said to him , “ Put your hand under my thigh .
NIRV	Genesis	24	3	The Lord is the God of heaven and the God of earth . I want you to make a promise to me in his name . I ’ m living among the people of Canaan . But I want you to promise me that you won ’ t get a wife for my son from their daughters .
NIRV	Genesis	24	4	Instead , promise me that you will go to my country and to my own relatives . Get a wife for my son Isaac from there. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	5	The servant asked Abraham , “ What if the woman doesn ’ t want to come back with me to this land ? Then should I take your son back to the country you came from ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	6	“ Make sure you don ’ t take my son back there , ” Abraham said .
NIRV	Genesis	24	7	“ The Lord , the God of heaven , took me away from my father ’ s family . He brought me out of my own land . He made me a promise . He said , ‘ I will give this land to your family after you. ’ The Lord will send his angel ahead of you . So you will be able to get a wife for my son from there .
NIRV	Genesis	24	8	The woman may not want to come back with you . If she doesn ’ t , you will be free from your promise . But don ’ t take my son back there. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	9	So the servant put his hand under Abraham ’ s thigh . He promised to do what his master wanted .
NIRV	Genesis	24	10	The servant chose ten of his master ’ s camels and left . He loaded the camels with all kinds of good things from his master . He started out for Aram Naharaim and made his way to the town of Nahor .
NIRV	Genesis	24	11	He stopped near the well outside the town . There he made the camels get down on their knees . It was almost evening , the time when women go out to get water .
NIRV	Genesis	24	12	Then he prayed , “ Lord , you are the God of my master Abraham . Make me successful today . Be kind to my master Abraham .
NIRV	Genesis	24	13	I ’ m standing beside this spring . The daughters of the people who live in the town are coming out here to get water .
NIRV	Genesis	24	14	I will speak to a young woman . I ’ ll say to her , ‘ Please lower your jar so I can have a drink. ’ Suppose she says , ‘ Have a drink of water , and I ’ ll get some for your camels too. ’ Then let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac . That ’ s how I ’ ll know you have been kind to my master. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	15	Before he had finished praying , Rebekah came out . She was carrying a jar on her shoulder . She was the daughter of Milkah ’ s son Bethuel . Milkah was the wife of Abraham ’ s brother Nahor .
NIRV	Genesis	24	16	The young woman was very beautiful . No man had ever slept with her . She went down to the spring . She filled her jar and came up again .
NIRV	Genesis	24	17	The servant hurried to meet her . He said , “ Please give me a little water from your jar. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	18	“ Have a drink , sir , ” she said . She quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink .
NIRV	Genesis	24	19	After she had given him a drink , she said , “ I ’ ll get water for your camels too . I ’ ll keep doing it until they have had enough to drink. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	20	So she quickly emptied her jar into the stone tub . Then she ran back to the well to get more water . She got enough for all his camels .
NIRV	Genesis	24	21	The man didn ’ t say a word . He watched her closely . He wanted to learn whether the Lord had given him success on the journey he had made .
NIRV	Genesis	24	22	The camels finished drinking . Then the man took out a gold nose ring . It weighed about a fifth of an ounce . He also took out two gold bracelets . They weighed about four ounces .
NIRV	Genesis	24	23	Then he asked , “ Whose daughter are you ? And please tell me something else . Is there room in your father ’ s house for us ? Can we spend the night there ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	25	She continued , “ We have plenty of straw and feed for your camels . We also have room for you to spend the night. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	26	Then the man bowed down and worshiped the Lord .
NIRV	Genesis	24	27	He said , “ I praise the Lord , the God of my master Abraham . The Lord hasn ’ t stopped being kind and faithful to my master . The Lord has led me on this journey . He has brought me to the house of my master ’ s relatives. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	28	The young woman ran home . She told her mother ’ s family what had happened .
NIRV	Genesis	24	29	Rebekah had a brother named Laban . He hurried out to the spring to meet the man .
NIRV	Genesis	24	30	Laban had seen the nose ring . He had seen the bracelets on his sister ’ s arms . And he had heard Rebekah tell what the man had said to her . So Laban went out to the man . He found him standing by the camels near the spring .
NIRV	Genesis	24	31	“ The Lord has given you his blessing , ” he said . “ So come with me . Why are you standing out here ? I ’ ve prepared my house for you . I also have a place for the camels. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	32	So the man went to the house . The camels were unloaded . Straw and feed were brought for the camels . And water was brought for him and his men to wash their feet .
NIRV	Genesis	24	33	Then food was placed in front of him . But he said , “ I won ’ t eat until I ’ ve told you what I have to say. ” “ Then tell us , ” Laban said .
NIRV	Genesis	24	34	So he said , “ I am Abraham ’ s servant .
NIRV	Genesis	24	35	The Lord has blessed my master greatly , and he has become rich . The Lord has given him sheep and cattle , silver and gold . He has also given him male and female servants , camels and donkeys .
NIRV	Genesis	24	36	My master ’ s wife Sarah had a son by him when she was old . He has given that son everything he owns .
NIRV	Genesis	24	37	My master made me promise him . He said , ‘ I ’ m living in the land of the people of Canaan . But promise me that you won ’ t get a wife for my son from their daughters .
NIRV	Genesis	24	38	Instead , go to my father ’ s family and to my own relatives . Get a wife for my son there. ’
NIRV	Genesis	24	39	“ Then I asked my master , ‘ What if the woman won ’ t come back with me ? ’
NIRV	Genesis	24	40	“ He replied , ‘ I have walked faithfully with the Lord . He will send his angel with you . He will give you success on your journey . So you will be able to get a wife for my son . She will be from my own relatives and from my father ’ s family .
NIRV	Genesis	24	41	When you go to my relatives , suppose they refuse to give her to you . Then you will be free from the promise you made to me. ’
NIRV	Genesis	24	42	“ Today I came to the spring . I said , ‘ Lord , you are the God of my master Abraham . Please make me successful on this journey I ’ ve made .
NIRV	Genesis	24	43	I ’ m standing beside this spring . A young woman will come out to get water . I ’ ll say to her , “ Please let me drink a little water from your jar. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	44	Suppose she says , “ Have a drink of water , and I ’ ll get some for your camels too. ” Then let her be the one the Lord has chosen for my master ’ s son. ’
NIRV	Genesis	24	45	“ Before I finished praying in my heart , Rebekah came out . She was carrying a jar on her shoulder . She went down to the spring and got water . I said to her , ‘ Please give me a drink. ’
NIRV	Genesis	24	46	“ She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder . She said , ‘ Have a drink , and I ’ ll get water for your camels too. ’ So I drank . She also got water for the camels .
NIRV	Genesis	24	47	“ I asked her , ‘ Whose daughter are you ? ’ “ She said , ‘ The daughter of Bethuel . He ’ s the son Milkah had by Nahor. ’ “ Then I put the ring in her nose . I put the bracelets on her arms .
NIRV	Genesis	24	48	And I bowed down and worshiped the Lord . I praised the Lord , the God of my master Abraham . He had led me on the right road . He had led me to get for my master ’ s son the granddaughter of my master ’ s brother .
NIRV	Genesis	24	49	Now will you be kind and faithful to my master ? If you will , tell me . And if you won ’ t , tell me . Then I ’ ll know which way to turn. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	50	Laban and Bethuel answered , “ The Lord has done all of this . We can ’ t say anything to you one way or the other .
NIRV	Genesis	24	51	Here is Rebekah . Take her and go . Let her become the wife of your master ’ s son , just as the Lord has said. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	52	Abraham ’ s servant heard what they said . So he bowed down to the Lord with his face to the ground .
NIRV	Genesis	24	53	He brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing . He gave all of them to Rebekah . He also gave expensive gifts to her brother and her mother .
NIRV	Genesis	24	54	Then Abraham ’ s servant and the men who were with him ate and drank . They spent the night there . When they got up the next morning , Abraham ’ s servant said , “ Send me back to my master. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	55	But her brother and her mother replied , “ Let the young woman stay with us ten days or so . Then you can go. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	56	But he said to them , “ Don ’ t make me wait . The Lord has given me success on my journey . Send me on my way so I can go to my master. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	57	Then they said , “ Let ’ s get Rebekah and ask her about it. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	58	So they sent for her and asked , “ Will you go with this man ? ” “ Yes , I ’ ll go , ” she said .
NIRV	Genesis	24	59	So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way with Abraham ’ s servant and his men . They also sent Rebekah ’ s servant with her .
NIRV	Genesis	24	60	And they gave Rebekah their blessing . They said to her , “ Dear sister , may your family grow by thousands and thousands . May they take over the cities of their enemies. ”
NIRV	Genesis	24	61	Then Rebekah and her female servants got ready . They got on their camels to go back with the man . So Abraham ’ s servant took Rebekah and left .
NIRV	Genesis	24	62	By that time Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi . He was living in the Negev Desert .
NIRV	Genesis	24	63	One evening he went out to the field . He wanted to spend some time thinking . When he looked up , he saw camels approaching .
NIRV	Genesis	24	64	Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac . She got down from her camel .
NIRV	Genesis	24	65	She asked the servant , “ Who is that man in the field coming to meet us ? ” “ He ’ s my master , ” the servant answered . So she covered her face with her veil .
NIRV	Genesis	24	66	Then the servant told Isaac everything he had done .
NIRV	Genesis	24	67	Isaac brought Rebekah into the tent that had belonged to his mother Sarah . And he married Rebekah . She became his wife , and he loved her . So Isaac was comforted after his mother died . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	25	25	The first one to come out was red . His whole body was covered with hair . So they named him Esau .
NIRV	Genesis	25	2	She had Zimran , Jokshan , Medan , Midian , Ishbak and Shuah by Abraham .
NIRV	Genesis	25	3	Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan . The children of Dedan were the Ashurites , the Letushites and the Leummites .
NIRV	Genesis	25	4	The sons of Midian were Ephah , Epher , Hanok , Abida and Eldaah . All of them were members of Keturah ’ s family line .
NIRV	Genesis	25	5	Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac .
NIRV	Genesis	25	6	But while he was still living , he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines . Then he sent them away from his son Isaac . He sent them to the land of the east .
NIRV	Genesis	25	7	Abraham lived a total of
NIRV	Genesis	25	175	years .
NIRV	Genesis	25	8	He took his last breath and died when he was very old . He had lived a very long time . Then he joined the members of his family who had already died .
NIRV	Genesis	25	9	Abraham ’ s sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him . They put his body in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre . It was in the field of Ephron , the son of Zohar the Hittite .
NIRV	Genesis	25	10	Abraham had bought the field from the Hittites . He was buried there with his wife Sarah .
NIRV	Genesis	25	11	After Abraham died , God blessed his son Isaac . At that time Isaac was living near Beer Lahai Roi . The Sons of Ishmael
NIRV	Genesis	25	12	tribes . They all lived in their own settlements and camps .
NIRV	Genesis	25	13	Here are the names of the sons of Ishmael . They are listed in the order they were born . Nebaioth was Ishmael ’ s oldest son . Then came Kedar , Adbeel , Mibsam ,
NIRV	Genesis	25	14	Mishma , Dumah , Massa ,

NIRV	Genesis	25	16	All of them were Ishmael ’ s sons . They were rulers of
NIRV	Genesis	25	17	Ishmael lived a total of
NIRV	Genesis	25	137	years . Then he took his last breath and died . He joined the members of his family who had already died .
NIRV	Genesis	25	18	His children settled in the area between Havilah and Shur . It was near the eastern border of Egypt , as you go toward Ashur . Ishmael ’ s children weren ’ t friendly toward any of the tribes related to them . Jacob and Esau
NIRV	Genesis	25	19	Here is the story of the family line of Abraham ’ s son Isaac . Abraham was the father of Isaac .
NIRV	Genesis	25	20	Isaac was
NIRV	Genesis	25	40	years old when he married Rebekah . She was the daughter of Bethuel , the Aramean from Paddan Aram . She was also the sister of Laban , the Aramean .
NIRV	Genesis	25	21	Rebekah couldn ’ t have children . So Isaac prayed to the Lord for her . And the Lord answered his prayer . His wife Rebekah became pregnant .
NIRV	Genesis	25	22	The babies struggled with each other inside her . She said , “ Why is this happening to me ? ” So she went to ask the Lord what she should do .
NIRV	Genesis	25	23	The Lord said to her , “ Two nations are in your body . Two tribes that are now inside you will be separated . One nation will be stronger than the other . The older son will serve the younger one. ”
NIRV	Genesis	25	24	The time came for Rebekah to have her babies . There were twin boys in her body .
NIRV	Genesis	25	26	Then his brother came out . His hand was holding onto Esau ’ s heel . So he was named Jacob . Isaac was
NIRV	Genesis	25	60	years old when Rebekah had them .
NIRV	Genesis	25	27	The boys grew up . Esau became a skillful hunter . He liked the open country . But Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents .
NIRV	Genesis	25	28	Isaac liked the meat of wild animals . So Esau was his favorite son . But Rebekah ’ s favorite was Jacob .
NIRV	Genesis	25	29	One day Jacob was cooking some stew . Esau came in from the open country . He was very hungry .
NIRV	Genesis	25	30	He said to Jacob , “ Quick ! I ’ m very hungry ! Let me have some of that red stew ! ” That ’ s why he was also named Edom .
NIRV	Genesis	25	31	Jacob replied , “ First sell me the rights that belong to you as the oldest son in the family. ”
NIRV	Genesis	25	32	“ Look , I ’ m dying of hunger , ” Esau said . “ What good are those rights to me ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	25	33	But Jacob said , “ First promise to sell me your rights. ” So Esau promised to do it . He sold Jacob all the rights that belonged to him as the oldest son .
NIRV	Genesis	25	34	Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew . Esau ate and drank . Then he got up and left . So Esau didn ’ t value the rights that belonged to him as the oldest son . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	26	26	During that time , Abimelek had come to him from Gerar . His personal adviser , Ahuzzath , had come with him . So had his army commander , Phicol .
NIRV	Genesis	26	2	The Lord appeared to Isaac and said , “ Do not go down to Egypt . Live in the land where I tell you to live .
NIRV	Genesis	26	3	Stay there for a while . I will be with you and give you my blessing . I will give all these lands to you and your children after you . And I will keep my word that I gave to your father Abraham .
NIRV	Genesis	26	4	I will make your children after you as many as the stars in the sky . And I will give them all these lands . All nations on earth will be blessed because of your children .
NIRV	Genesis	26	5	I will do all these things because Abraham obeyed me . He did everything I required . He kept my commands , my rules and my instructions. ”
NIRV	Genesis	26	6	So Isaac stayed in Gerar .
NIRV	Genesis	26	7	The men of that place asked him about his wife . He said , “ She ’ s my sister. ” He was afraid to say , “ She ’ s my wife. ” He thought , “ The men of this place might kill me because of Rebekah . She ’ s a beautiful woman. ”
NIRV	Genesis	26	8	Isaac had been there a long time . One day Abimelek , the king of the Philistines , looked down from a window . He saw Isaac hugging and kissing his wife Rebekah .
NIRV	Genesis	26	9	So Abimelek sent for Isaac . He said , “ She ’ s really your wife , isn ’ t she ? Why did you say she was your sister ? ” Isaac answered him , “ I thought I might lose my life because of her. ”
NIRV	Genesis	26	10	Then Abimelek said , “ What have you done to us ? What if one of the men slept with your wife ? Then you would have made us guilty. ”
NIRV	Genesis	26	11	So Abimelek gave orders to all the people . He said , “ Anyone who harms this man or his wife will surely be put to death. ”
NIRV	Genesis	26	12	Isaac planted crops in that land . That same year he gathered
NIRV	Genesis	26	100	times more than he planted . That was because the Lord blessed him .
NIRV	Genesis	26	13	Isaac became rich . His wealth continued to grow until he became very rich .
NIRV	Genesis	26	14	He had many flocks and herds and servants . Isaac had so much that the Philistines became jealous of him .
NIRV	Genesis	26	15	So they stopped up all the wells the servants of his father Abraham had dug . They filled them with dirt .
NIRV	Genesis	26	16	Then Abimelek said to Isaac , “ Move away from us . You have become too powerful for us. ”
NIRV	Genesis	26	17	So Isaac moved away from there . He camped in the Valley of Gerar , where he made his home .
NIRV	Genesis	26	18	Isaac opened up the wells again . They had been dug in the time of his father Abraham . The Philistines had stopped them up after Abraham died . Isaac gave the wells the same names his father had given them .
NIRV	Genesis	26	19	Isaac ’ s servants dug wells in the valley . There they discovered fresh water .
NIRV	Genesis	26	20	But the people of Gerar who took care of their own herds argued with the people who took care of Isaac ’ s herds . “ The water is ours ! ” the people of Gerar said . So Isaac named the well Esek . That ’ s because they argued with him .
NIRV	Genesis	26	21	Then Isaac ’ s servants dug another well . They argued about that one too . So he named it Sitnah .
NIRV	Genesis	26	22	Isaac moved on from there and dug another well . But no one argued about that one . So he named it Rehoboth . He said , “ Now the Lord has given us room . Now we will be successful in the land. ”
NIRV	Genesis	26	23	From there Isaac went up to Beersheba .
NIRV	Genesis	26	24	That night the Lord appeared to him . He said , “ I am the God of your father Abraham . Do not be afraid . I am with you . I will bless you . I will increase the number of your children because of my servant Abraham. ”
NIRV	Genesis	26	25	Isaac built an altar there and worshiped the Lord . There he set up his tent . And there his servants dug a well .
NIRV	Genesis	26	27	Isaac asked them , “ Why have you come to me ? You were angry with me and sent me away. ”
NIRV	Genesis	26	28	They answered , “ We saw clearly that the Lord was with you . So we said , ‘ There should be an agreement between us and you. ’ We want to make a peace treaty with you .
NIRV	Genesis	26	29	Give us your word that you won ’ t harm us . We didn ’ t harm you . We always treated you well . We sent you away peacefully . And now the Lord has blessed you. ”

NIRV	Genesis	27	27	So Jacob went to him and kissed him . When Isaac smelled the clothes , he gave Jacob his blessing . He said , “ It really is the smell of my son . It ’ s like the smell of a field that the Lord has blessed .
NIRV	Genesis	27	2	Isaac said , “ I ’ m an old man now . And I don ’ t know when I ’ ll die .
NIRV	Genesis	27	3	Now then , get your weapons . Get your bow and arrows . Go out to the open country . Hunt some wild animals for me .
NIRV	Genesis	27	4	Prepare for me the kind of tasty food I like . Bring it to me to eat . Then I ’ ll give you my blessing before I die. ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	5	Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau . Esau left for the open country . He went to hunt for a wild animal and bring it back .
NIRV	Genesis	27	6	Then Rebekah said to her son Jacob , “ Look , I heard your father speaking to your brother Esau .
NIRV	Genesis	27	7	He said , ‘ Bring me a wild animal . Prepare some tasty food for me to eat . Then I ’ ll give you my blessing before I die . The Lord will be my witness. ’ ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	8	Rebekah continued , “ My son , listen carefully . Do what I tell you .
NIRV	Genesis	27	9	Go out to the flock . Bring me two of the finest young goats . I will prepare tasty food for your father . I ’ ll make it just the way he likes it .
NIRV	Genesis	27	10	I want you to take it to your father to eat . Then he ’ ll give you his blessing before he dies. ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	11	Jacob said to his mother Rebekah , “ My brother Esau ’ s body is covered with hair . But my skin is smooth .
NIRV	Genesis	27	12	What if my father touches me ? He would know I was trying to trick him . He would curse me instead of giving me a blessing. ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	13	His mother said to him , “ My son , let the curse be on me . Just do what I say . Go and get the goats for me. ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	14	So he went and got the goats . He brought them to his mother . And she prepared some tasty food . She made it just the way his father liked it .
NIRV	Genesis	27	15	The clothes of her older son Esau were in her house . She took Esau ’ s best clothes and put them on her younger son Jacob .
NIRV	Genesis	27	16	She covered his hands with the skins of the goats . She also covered the smooth part of his neck with them .
NIRV	Genesis	27	17	Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made .
NIRV	Genesis	27	18	He went to his father and said , “ My father. ” “ Yes , my son , ” Isaac answered . “ Who is it ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	19	Jacob said to his father , “ I ’ m your oldest son Esau . I ’ ve done as you told me . Please sit up . Eat some of my wild meat . Then give me your blessing. ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	20	Isaac asked his son , “ How did you find it so quickly , my son ? ” “ The Lord your God gave me success , ” he replied .
NIRV	Genesis	27	21	Then Isaac said to Jacob , “ Come near so I can touch you , my son . I want to know whether you really are my son Esau. ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	22	Jacob went close to his father . Isaac touched him and said , “ The voice is the voice of Jacob . But the hands are the hands of Esau. ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	23	Isaac didn ’ t recognize Jacob . Jacob ’ s hands were covered with hair like those of his brother Esau . So Isaac blessed him .
NIRV	Genesis	27	24	“ Are you really my son Esau ? ” he asked . “ I am , ” Jacob replied .
NIRV	Genesis	27	25	Isaac said , “ My son , bring me some of your wild meat to eat . Then I ’ ll give you my blessing. ” Jacob brought it to him . So Isaac ate . Jacob also brought some wine . And Isaac drank .
NIRV	Genesis	27	26	Then Jacob ’ s father Isaac said to him , “ Come here , my son . Kiss me. ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	28	May God give you dew from heaven . May he give you the richness of the earth . May he give you plenty of grain and fresh wine .
NIRV	Genesis	27	29	May nations serve you . May they bow down to you . Rule over your brothers . May the sons of your mother bow down to you . May those who curse you be cursed . And may those who bless you be blessed. ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	30	When Isaac finished blessing him , Jacob left his father . Just then his brother Esau came in from hunting .
NIRV	Genesis	27	31	He too prepared some tasty food . He brought it to his father . Then Esau said to him , “ My father , please sit up . Eat some of my wild meat . Then give me your blessing. ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	32	His father Isaac asked him , “ Who are you ? ” “ I ’ m your son , ” he answered . “ I ’ m Esau , your oldest son. ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	33	Isaac began to shake all over . He said , “ Then who hunted a wild animal and brought it to me ? I ate it just before you came . I gave him my blessing . And he will certainly be blessed ! ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	34	Esau heard his father ’ s words . Then he yelled loudly and bitterly . He said to his father , “ Bless me ! Bless me too , my father ! ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	35	But Isaac said , “ Your brother came and tricked me . He took your blessing. ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	36	Esau said , “ Isn ’ t Jacob just the right name for him ? This is the second time he has taken advantage of me . First , he took my rights as the oldest son . And now he ’ s taken my blessing ! ” Then Esau asked , “ Haven ’ t you saved any blessing for me ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	37	Isaac answered Esau , “ I ’ ve made him ruler over you . I ’ ve made all his relatives serve him . And I ’ ve provided him with grain and fresh wine . So what can I possibly do for you , my son ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	38	Esau said to his father , “ Do you have only one blessing , my father ? Bless me too , my father ! ” Then Esau wept loudly .
NIRV	Genesis	27	39	His father Isaac answered him , “ You will live far away from the fruit of the earth . You will live far away from the dew of heaven above .
NIRV	Genesis	27	40	You will live by using the sword . And you will serve your brother . But you will grow restless . Then you will throw off the heavy load he has caused you to carry. ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	41	Esau was angry with Jacob . He was angry because of the blessing his father had given to Jacob . He said to himself , “ The days of sorrow over my father ’ s death are near . Then I ’ ll kill my brother Jacob. ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	42	Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said . So she sent for her younger son Jacob . She said to him , “ Your brother Esau is planning to get back at you by killing you .
NIRV	Genesis	27	43	Now then , my son , do what I say . Run away at once to my brother Laban in Harran .
NIRV	Genesis	27	44	Stay with him until your brother ’ s anger calms down .
NIRV	Genesis	27	45	When he forgets what you did to him , I ’ ll let you know . Then you can come back from there . Why should I lose both of you in one day ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	27	46	Then Rebekah spoke to Isaac . She said , “ I ’ m sick of living because of Esau ’ s Hittite wives . Suppose Jacob also marries a Hittite woman . If he does , my life won ’ t be worth living. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	28	4	May he give you and your children after you the blessing he gave to Abraham . Then you can take over the land where you now live as an outsider . It ’ s the land God gave to Abraham. ”
NIRV	Genesis	28	5	Isaac sent Jacob on his way . Jacob went to Paddan Aram . He went to Laban , the son of Bethuel the Aramean . Laban was Rebekah ’ s brother . And Rebekah was the mother of Jacob and Esau .
NIRV	Genesis	28	6	Esau found out that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram . Isaac wanted him to get a wife from there . Esau heard that when Isaac blessed Jacob , he commanded him , “ Don ’ t get married to a woman from Canaan. ”
NIRV	Genesis	28	7	Esau also learned that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Paddan Aram .
NIRV	Genesis	28	8	Then Esau realized how much his father Isaac disliked Canaanite women .

NIRV	Genesis	28	10	Jacob left Beersheba and started out for Harran .
NIRV	Genesis	28	11	He reached a certain place and stopped for the night . The sun had already set . He took one of the stones there and placed it under his head . Then he lay down to sleep .
NIRV	Genesis	28	12	In a dream he saw a stairway standing on the earth . Its top reached to heaven . The angels of God were going up and coming down on it .

NIRV	Genesis	28	16	Jacob woke up from his sleep . Then he thought , “ The Lord is surely in this place . And I didn ’ t even know it. ”
NIRV	Genesis	28	17	Jacob was afraid . He said , “ How holy this place is ! This must be the house of God . This is the gate of heaven. ”
NIRV	Genesis	28	18	Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head . He set it up as a sacred stone . And he poured olive oil on top of it .
NIRV	Genesis	28	19	He named that place Bethel . But the city used to be called Luz .
NIRV	Genesis	28	20	Then Jacob made a promise . He said , “ May God be with me . May he watch over me on this journey I ’ m taking . May he give me food to eat and clothes to wear .

NIRV	Genesis	29	29	Laban gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her servant .
NIRV	Genesis	29	2	There he saw a well in the open country . Three flocks of sheep were lying near it . The flocks were given water from the well . The stone over the opening of the well was large .
NIRV	Genesis	29	3	All the flocks would gather there . The shepherds would roll the stone away from the well ’ s opening . They would give water to the sheep . Then they would put the stone back in its place over the opening of the well .
NIRV	Genesis	29	4	Jacob asked the shepherds , “ My friends , where are you from ? ” “ We ’ re from Harran , ” they replied .
NIRV	Genesis	29	5	He said to them , “ Do you know Nahor ’ s grandson Laban ? ” “ Yes , we know him , ” they answered .
NIRV	Genesis	29	6	Then Jacob asked them , “ How is he ? ” “ He ’ s fine , ” they said . “ Here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep. ”
NIRV	Genesis	29	7	“ Look , ” he said , “ the sun is still high in the sky . It ’ s not time for the flocks to be brought together . Give water to the sheep and take them back to the grasslands. ”
NIRV	Genesis	29	8	“ We can ’ t , ” they replied . “ We have to wait until all the flocks are brought together . The stone has to be rolled away from the opening of the well . Then we ’ ll give water to the sheep. ”
NIRV	Genesis	29	9	He was still talking with them when Rachel came with her father ’ s sheep . It was her job to take care of the flock .
NIRV	Genesis	29	10	Rachel was the daughter of Laban , Jacob ’ s uncle . When Jacob saw Rachel with Laban ’ s sheep , he went over to the well . He rolled the stone away from the opening . He gave water to his uncle ’ s sheep .
NIRV	Genesis	29	11	Jacob kissed Rachel . Then he began to cry because he was so happy .
NIRV	Genesis	29	12	He had told Rachel he was a relative of her father . He had also said he was Rebekah ’ s son . Rachel ran and told her father what Jacob had said .

NIRV	Genesis	29	14	Then Laban said to him , “ You are my own flesh and blood. ” Jacob Marries Leah and Rachel Jacob stayed with Laban for a whole month .
NIRV	Genesis	29	15	Then Laban said to him , “ You are one of my relatives . But is that any reason for you to work for me for nothing ? Tell me what your pay should be. ”
NIRV	Genesis	29	16	Laban had two daughters . The name of the older one was Leah . And the name of the younger one was Rachel .
NIRV	Genesis	29	17	Leah was plain , but Rachel was beautiful . She had a nice figure .
NIRV	Genesis	29	18	Jacob was in love with Rachel . He said to Laban , “ I ’ ll work for you for seven years so I can marry your younger daughter Rachel. ”
NIRV	Genesis	29	19	Laban said , “ It ’ s better for me to give her to you than to some other man . Stay here with me. ”
NIRV	Genesis	29	20	So Jacob worked for seven years so he could marry Rachel . But they seemed like only a few days to him because he loved her so much .
NIRV	Genesis	29	21	Then Jacob said to Laban , “ Give me my wife . I ’ ve completed my time . I want to sleep with her. ”
NIRV	Genesis	29	22	So Laban brought all the people of the place together and had a feast prepared .
NIRV	Genesis	29	23	But when evening came , he gave his daughter Leah to Jacob . And Jacob slept with her .
NIRV	Genesis	29	24	Laban gave his female servant Zilpah to his daughter as her servant .
NIRV	Genesis	29	25	When Jacob woke up the next morning , there was Leah next to him ! So he said to Laban , “ What have you done to me ? I worked for you so I could marry Rachel , didn ’ t I ? Why did you trick me ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	29	26	Laban replied , “ It isn ’ t our practice here to give the younger daughter to be married before the older one .
NIRV	Genesis	29	27	Complete this daughter ’ s wedding week . Then we ’ ll give you the younger one also . But you will have to work for another seven years. ”
NIRV	Genesis	29	28	So Jacob completed the week with Leah . Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife .
NIRV	Genesis	29	30	Jacob slept with Rachel also . He loved Rachel more than he loved Leah . And he worked for Laban for another seven years . Jacob Becomes the Father of Many Children

NIRV	Genesis	30	30	You had only a little before I came . But that little has become a lot . The Lord has blessed you everywhere I ’ ve been . But when can I do something for my own family ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	30	2	Jacob became angry with her . He said , “ Do you think I ’ m God ? He ’ s the one who has kept you from having children. ”
NIRV	Genesis	30	3	Then she said , “ Here ’ s my servant Bilhah . Sleep with her so that she can have children for me . Then I too can have a family through her. ”
NIRV	Genesis	30	4	So Rachel gave Jacob her servant Bilhah as a wife . Jacob slept with her .
NIRV	Genesis	30	5	And Bilhah became pregnant . She had a son by him .

NIRV	Genesis	30	12	Leah ’ s servant Zilpah had a second son by Jacob .
NIRV	Genesis	30	13	Then Leah said , “ I ’ m so happy ! The women will call me happy. ” So she named him Asher .
NIRV	Genesis	30	14	While the wheat harvest was being gathered , Reuben went out into the fields . He found some mandrake plants . He brought them to his mother Leah . Rachel said to Leah , “ Please give me some of your son ’ s mandrakes. ”
NIRV	Genesis	30	15	But Leah said to her , “ Isn ’ t it enough that you took my husband away ? Are you going to take my son ’ s mandrakes too ? ” Rachel said , “ All right . Jacob can sleep with you tonight if you give me your son ’ s mandrakes. ”
NIRV	Genesis	30	16	Jacob came in from the fields that evening . Leah went out to meet him . “ You have to sleep with me tonight , ” she said . “ I ’ ve traded my son ’ s mandrakes for that time with you. ” So he slept with her that night .
NIRV	Genesis	30	17	God listened to Leah . She became pregnant and had a fifth son by Jacob .
NIRV	Genesis	30	18	Then Leah said , “ God has rewarded me because I gave my female servant to my husband. ” So she named the boy Issachar .
NIRV	Genesis	30	19	Leah became pregnant again . She had a sixth son by Jacob .
NIRV	Genesis	30	20	Then Leah said , “ God has given me a priceless gift . This time my husband will treat me with honor . I ’ ve had six sons by him. ” So she named the boy Zebulun .
NIRV	Genesis	30	21	Some time later she had a daughter . She named her Dinah .
NIRV	Genesis	30	22	Then God listened to Rachel . He showed concern for her . He made it possible for her to have children .
NIRV	Genesis	30	23	She became pregnant and had a son . Then she said , “ God has taken away my shame. ”
NIRV	Genesis	30	24	She said , “ May the Lord give me another son. ” So she named him Joseph . Jacob Becomes the Owner of Large Flocks
NIRV	Genesis	30	25	After Rachel had Joseph , Jacob spoke to Laban . He said , “ Send me on my way . I want to go back to my own home and country .
NIRV	Genesis	30	26	Give me my wives and children . I worked for you to get them . So I ’ ll be on my way . You know how much work I ’ ve done for you. ”
NIRV	Genesis	30	27	But Laban said to him , “ If you are pleased with me , stay here . I ’ ve discovered that the Lord has blessed me because of you. ”
NIRV	Genesis	30	28	He continued , “ Name your pay . I ’ ll give it to you. ”
NIRV	Genesis	30	29	Jacob said to him , “ You know how hard I ’ ve worked for you . You know that your livestock has done better under my care .
NIRV	Genesis	30	31	“ What should I give you ? ” Laban asked . “ Don ’ t give me anything , ” Jacob replied . “ Just do one thing for me . Then I ’ ll go on taking care of your flocks and watching over them .
NIRV	Genesis	30	32	Let me go through all your flocks today . Let me remove every speckled or spotted sheep . Let me remove every dark-colored lamb . Let me remove every speckled or spotted goat . They will be my pay .
NIRV	Genesis	30	33	My honesty will be a witness about me in days to come . It will be a witness every time you check on what you have paid me . Suppose I have a goat that doesn ’ t have speckles or spots . Or suppose I have a lamb that isn ’ t dark colored . Then it will be considered stolen. ”
NIRV	Genesis	30	34	“ I agree , ” said Laban . “ Let ’ s do what you have said. ”
NIRV	Genesis	30	35	That same day Laban removed all the male goats that had stripes or spots . He removed all the female goats that had speckles or spots . They were the ones that had white on them . He also removed all the dark-colored lambs . He had his sons take care of them .
NIRV	Genesis	30	36	Then he put a journey of three days between himself and Jacob . But Jacob continued to take care of the rest of Laban ’ s flocks .
NIRV	Genesis	30	37	Jacob took freshly cut branches from poplar , almond and plane trees . He made white stripes on the branches by peeling off their bark .
NIRV	Genesis	30	38	Then he placed the peeled branches in all the stone tubs where the animals drank water . He placed them there so they would be right in front of the flocks when they came to drink . The flocks were ready to mate when they came to drink .
NIRV	Genesis	30	39	So they mated in front of the branches . And the flocks gave birth to striped , speckled or spotted little ones .
NIRV	Genesis	30	40	Jacob put the little ones of the flock to one side by themselves . But he made the older ones face the striped and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban . In that way , he made separate flocks for himself . He didn ’ t put them with Laban ’ s animals .
NIRV	Genesis	30	41	Every time the stronger females were ready to mate , Jacob would place the branches in the stone tubs . He would place them in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches .
NIRV	Genesis	30	42	But if the animals were weak , he wouldn ’ t place the branches there . So the weak animals went to Laban . And the strong ones went to Jacob .
NIRV	Genesis	30	43	That ’ s how Jacob became very rich . He became the owner of large flocks . He also had many male and female servants . And he had many camels and donkeys . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	31	31	Jacob answered Laban , “ I was afraid . I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force .
NIRV	Genesis	31	2	Jacob noticed that Laban ’ s feelings toward him had changed .
NIRV	Genesis	31	3	Then the Lord spoke to Jacob . He said , “ Go back to your father ’ s land and to your relatives . I will be with you. ”
NIRV	Genesis	31	4	So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah . He told them to come out to the fields where his flocks were .
NIRV	Genesis	31	5	He said to them , “ I see that your father ’ s feelings toward me have changed . But the God of my father has been with me .
NIRV	Genesis	31	6	You know that I ’ ve worked for your father with all my strength .
NIRV	Genesis	31	7	But your father has cheated me . He has changed my pay ten times . In spite of everything that ’ s happened , God hasn ’ t let him harm me .
NIRV	Genesis	31	8	Sometimes Laban would say , ‘ The speckled ones will be your pay. ’ Then all the flocks had little ones with speckles . At other times he would say , ‘ The striped ones will be your pay. ’ Then all the flocks had little ones with stripes .
NIRV	Genesis	31	9	So God has taken away your father ’ s livestock and given them to me .
NIRV	Genesis	31	10	“ Once during the mating season I had a dream . In my dream I looked and saw male goats mating with the flock . The goats had stripes , speckles or spots .
NIRV	Genesis	31	11	The angel of God said to me in the dream , ‘ Jacob. ’ I answered , ‘ Here I am. ’
NIRV	Genesis	31	12	He said , ‘ Look around you . See the male goats mating with the flock . All of them have stripes , speckles or spots . That ’ s because I have seen everything that Laban has been doing to you .
NIRV	Genesis	31	13	I am the God of Bethel . That is where you poured olive oil on a sacred stone . There you made a promise to me . Now leave this land . Go back to your own land. ’ ”

NIRV	Genesis	31	16	All the wealth God took away from our father really belongs to us and our children . So do what God has told you to do. ”
NIRV	Genesis	31	17	Then Jacob put his children and wives on camels .
NIRV	Genesis	31	18	He drove all his livestock ahead of him . He also took with him everything he had acquired in Paddan Aram . He left to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan .
NIRV	Genesis	31	19	Laban had gone to clip the wool from his sheep . While he was gone , Rachel stole the statues of the family gods that belonged to her father .

NIRV	Genesis	31	23	He took his relatives with him and went after Jacob . Seven days later he caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead .
NIRV	Genesis	31	24	Then God came to Laban , the Aramean , in a dream at night . He said to him , “ Be careful . Do not say anything to Jacob , whether it is good or bad. ”
NIRV	Genesis	31	25	Jacob had set up his tent in the hill country of Gilead . That ’ s where Laban caught up with him . Laban and his relatives camped there too .
NIRV	Genesis	31	26	Laban said to Jacob , “ What have you done ? You have tricked me . You have taken my daughters away like prisoners of war .
NIRV	Genesis	31	27	Why did you run away in secret and trick me ? Why didn ’ t you tell me ? Then I could have sent you away happily . We could have sung to the music of tambourines and harps .
NIRV	Genesis	31	28	You didn ’ t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye . You have done a foolish thing .
NIRV	Genesis	31	29	I have the power to harm you . But last night the God of your father spoke to me . He said , ‘ Be careful . Do not say anything to Jacob , whether it is good or bad. ’
NIRV	Genesis	31	30	Now you have run away . You longed to go back to your father ’ s home . But why did you have to steal the statues of my gods ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	31	32	But if you find anyone who has the statues of your gods , that person will not remain alive . While our relatives are watching , look for yourself . See if there ’ s anything of yours here with me . If you find anything belonging to you , take it. ” But Jacob didn ’ t know that Rachel had stolen the statues .
NIRV	Genesis	31	33	So Laban went into Jacob ’ s tent and Leah ’ s tent . He went into the tent of their two female servants . But he didn ’ t find anything . After he came out of Leah ’ s tent , he entered Rachel ’ s tent .
NIRV	Genesis	31	34	Rachel was the one who had taken the statues of Laban ’ s family gods . She had put them inside her camel ’ s saddle . She was sitting on them . Laban searched the whole tent . But he didn ’ t find anything .
NIRV	Genesis	31	35	Rachel said to her father , “ I ’ m sorry , sir . I can ’ t get up for you right now . But don ’ t be angry with me . I ’ m having my monthly period. ” So he searched everywhere but couldn ’ t find the statues of his gods .
NIRV	Genesis	31	36	Jacob was very angry with Laban . “ What is my crime ? ” he asked . “ What have I done to you that you hunt me down like this ?
NIRV	Genesis	31	37	You have searched through all my things . What have you found that belongs to your family ? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine . Let them decide between the two of us .
NIRV	Genesis	31	38	“ I ’ ve been with you for
NIRV	Genesis	31	39	I didn ’ t bring you animals torn apart by wild beasts . I made up for the loss myself . Also , you made me pay for anything stolen by day or night .
NIRV	Genesis	31	40	And what was my life like ? The heat burned me in the daytime . And it was so cold at night that I froze . I couldn ’ t sleep .
NIRV	Genesis	31	41	That ’ s what it was like for the
NIRV	Genesis	31	42	But the God of my father was with me . He is the God of Abraham and the God Isaac worshiped . If he hadn ’ t been with me , you would surely have sent me away without anything to show for all my work . But God has seen my hard times . He has seen all the work my hands have done . So last night he warned you. ”
NIRV	Genesis	31	43	Laban answered Jacob , “ The women are my daughters . The children are my children . The flocks are my flocks . Everything you see is mine . But what can I do today about these daughters of mine ? What can I do about the children they ’ ve had ?
NIRV	Genesis	31	44	Come now . Let ’ s make a formal agreement , you and I . Let it be a witness between us. ”
NIRV	Genesis	31	45	So Jacob set up a stone as a way to remember .
NIRV	Genesis	31	46	He said to his relatives , “ Get some stones. ” So they took stones and put them in a pile . And they ate there by it .
NIRV	Genesis	31	47	Laban named the pile of stones Jegar Sahadutha . Jacob named it Galeed .
NIRV	Genesis	31	48	Laban said , “ This pile of stones is a witness between you and me today. ” That ’ s why it was named Galeed .
NIRV	Genesis	31	49	It was also called Mizpah . That ’ s because Laban said , “ May the Lord keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other .
NIRV	Genesis	31	50	Don ’ t treat my daughters badly . Don ’ t get married to any women besides my daughters . There isn ’ t anyone here to see what we ’ re doing . But remember that God is a witness between you and me. ”
NIRV	Genesis	31	51	Laban also said to Jacob , “ Here is this pile of stones . And here is this stone I ’ ve set up . I ’ ve set them up between you and me .
NIRV	Genesis	31	52	This pile is a witness . And this stone is a witness . They are witnesses that I won ’ t go past this pile to harm you . And they are witnesses that you won ’ t go past this pile and this stone to harm me .
NIRV	Genesis	31	53	The God of Abraham and Nahor is also the God of their father . May their God decide which of us is right. ” So Jacob made a promise using the name of the God his father Isaac worshiped .
NIRV	Genesis	31	54	He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country . And he invited his relatives to a meal . After they had eaten , they spent the night there .
NIRV	Genesis	31	55	Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters . He gave them his blessing . Then he left and returned home . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	32	2	Jacob saw them . He said , “ This is the army of God ! ” So he named that place Mahanaim .
NIRV	Genesis	32	3	Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau . Esau lived in the land of Seir . It was also called the country of Edom .
NIRV	Genesis	32	4	Jacob told the messengers what to do . He said , “ Here ’ s what you must tell my master Esau . ‘ Your servant Jacob says , “ I ’ ve been staying with Laban . I ’ ve remained there until now .
NIRV	Genesis	32	5	I have cattle and donkeys and sheep and goats . I also have male and female servants . Now I ’ m sending this message to you . I hope I can please you. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Genesis	32	6	The messengers came back to Jacob . They said , “ We went to your brother Esau . He ’ s coming now to meet you . He has
NIRV	Genesis	32	400	men with him. ”
NIRV	Genesis	32	7	Jacob was very worried and afraid . So he separated the people with him into two groups . He also separated the flocks and herds and camels .
NIRV	Genesis	32	8	He thought , “ Esau might come and attack one group . If he does , the group that ’ s left can escape. ”
NIRV	Genesis	32	9	Then Jacob prayed , “ You are the God of my grandfather Abraham . You are the God of my father Isaac . Lord , you are the one who said to me , ‘ Go back to your country and your relatives . Then I will give you success. ’
NIRV	Genesis	32	10	You have been very kind and faithful to me . But I ’ m not worthy of any of this . When I crossed this Jordan River , all I had was my walking stick . But now I ’ ve become two camps .
NIRV	Genesis	32	11	sons and sent them across the Jabbok River .
NIRV	Genesis	32	12	But you have said , ‘ I will surely give you success . I will make your children as many as the grains of sand on the seashore . People will not be able to count them. ’ ”
NIRV	Genesis	32	13	Jacob spent the night there . He chose a gift for his brother Esau from what he had with him .
NIRV	Genesis	32	14	He chose
NIRV	Genesis	32	200	female sheep and
NIRV	Genesis	32	20	Make sure you say , ‘ Your servant Jacob is coming behind us. ’ ” Jacob was thinking , “ I ’ ll make peace with him with these gifts I ’ m sending on ahead . When I see him later , maybe he ’ ll welcome me. ”
NIRV	Genesis	32	15	He chose
NIRV	Genesis	32	30	So Jacob named the place Peniel . He said , “ I saw God face to face . But I ’ m still alive ! ”
NIRV	Genesis	32	40	cows and ten bulls . And he chose
NIRV	Genesis	32	16	He put each herd by itself . Then he put his servants in charge of them . He said to his servants , “ Go on ahead of me . Keep some space between the herds. ”
NIRV	Genesis	32	17	Jacob spoke to his servant who was leading the way . He said , “ My brother Esau will meet you . He ’ ll ask , ‘ Who is your master ? Where are you going ? And who owns all these animals in front of you ? ’
NIRV	Genesis	32	18	Then say to Esau , ‘ They belong to your servant Jacob . They are a gift to you from him . And Jacob is coming behind us. ’ ”
NIRV	Genesis	32	19	He also spoke to the second and third servants . He told them and all the others who followed the herds what to do . He said , “ Say the same thing to Esau when you meet him .
NIRV	Genesis	32	21	So Jacob ’ s gifts went on ahead of him . But he himself spent the night in the camp . Jacob Wrestles With God
NIRV	Genesis	32	22	That night Jacob got up . He took his two wives , his two female servants and his
NIRV	Genesis	32	23	After they had crossed the stream , he sent over everything he owned .
NIRV	Genesis	32	24	So Jacob was left alone . A man wrestled with him until morning .
NIRV	Genesis	32	25	The man saw that he couldn ’ t win . So he touched the inside of Jacob ’ s hip . As Jacob wrestled with the man , Jacob ’ s hip was twisted .
NIRV	Genesis	32	26	Then the man said , “ Let me go . It is morning. ” But Jacob replied , “ I won ’ t let you go unless you bless me. ”
NIRV	Genesis	32	27	The man asked him , “ What is your name ? ” “ Jacob , ” he answered .
NIRV	Genesis	32	28	Then the man said , “ Your name will not be Jacob anymore . Instead , it will be Israel . You have wrestled with God and with people . And you have won. ”
NIRV	Genesis	32	29	Jacob said , “ Please tell me your name. ” But he replied , “ Why do you want to know my name ? ” Then he blessed Jacob there .
NIRV	Genesis	32	31	The sun rose above Jacob as he passed by Peniel . He was limping because of his hip .

NIRV	Genesis	33	33	Jacob looked and saw Esau coming with his
NIRV	Genesis	33	400	men ! So Jacob separated the children . He put them with Leah , Rachel and the two female servants .
NIRV	Genesis	33	2	He put the servants and their children in front . He put Leah and her children next . And he put Rachel and Joseph last .
NIRV	Genesis	33	3	He himself went on ahead . As he came near his brother , he bowed down to the ground seven times .
NIRV	Genesis	33	4	But Esau ran to meet Jacob . He hugged him and threw his arms around his neck . He kissed him , and they cried for joy .
NIRV	Genesis	33	5	Then Esau looked around and saw the women and children . “ Who are these people with you ? ” he asked . Jacob answered , “ They are the children God has so kindly given to me. ”
NIRV	Genesis	33	6	Then the female servants and their children came near and bowed down .
NIRV	Genesis	33	7	Next , Leah and her children came and bowed down . Last of all came Joseph and Rachel . They bowed down too .
NIRV	Genesis	33	8	Esau asked , “ Why did you send all those herds I saw ? ” “ I hoped I could do something to please you , ” Jacob replied .
NIRV	Genesis	33	9	But Esau said , “ I already have plenty , my brother . Keep what you have for yourself. ”
NIRV	Genesis	33	10	“ No , please ! ” said Jacob . “ If I ’ ve pleased you , accept this gift from me . Seeing your face is like seeing the face of God . You have welcomed me so kindly .
NIRV	Genesis	33	11	Please accept the present that was brought to you . God has given me so much . I have everything I need. ” Jacob wouldn ’ t give in . So Esau accepted it .
NIRV	Genesis	33	12	Then Esau said , “ Let ’ s be on our way . I ’ ll go with you. ”
NIRV	Genesis	33	13	But Jacob said to him , “ You know that the children are young . You also know that I have to take care of the cows and female sheep that are feeding their little ones . If the animals are driven hard for just one day , all of them will die .
NIRV	Genesis	33	14	So you go on ahead of me . I ’ ll move along only as fast as the flocks and herds and the children can go . I ’ ll go slowly until I come to you in Seir. ”
NIRV	Genesis	33	15	Esau said , “ Then let me leave some of my men with you. ” “ Why do that ? ” Jacob asked . “ I just hope I ’ ve pleased you. ”
NIRV	Genesis	33	16	So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir .
NIRV	Genesis	33	17	But Jacob went to Sukkoth . There he built a place for himself . He also made shelters for his livestock . That ’ s why the place is named Sukkoth .
NIRV	Genesis	33	18	After Jacob came from Paddan Aram , he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan . He camped where he could see the city .
NIRV	Genesis	33	19	For
NIRV	Genesis	33	100	pieces of silver he bought a piece of land . He got it from Hamor ’ s sons . Hamor was the father of Shechem . Jacob set up his tent on that piece of land .

NIRV	Genesis	34	34	Dinah was the daughter Leah had by Jacob . Dinah went out to visit the women of the land .
NIRV	Genesis	34	2	Hamor , the Hivite , was the ruler of that area . When his son Shechem saw Dinah , he took her and raped her .
NIRV	Genesis	34	3	Then he longed for Jacob ’ s daughter Dinah . He fell in love with her and spoke tenderly to her .
NIRV	Genesis	34	4	Shechem said to his father Hamor , “ Get me that young woman . I want her to be my wife. ”
NIRV	Genesis	34	5	Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been raped . His sons were in the fields with his livestock . So he did nothing about it until they came home .
NIRV	Genesis	34	6	Then Shechem ’ s father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob .
NIRV	Genesis	34	7	Jacob ’ s sons had come in from the fields . They came as soon as they heard what had happened . They were shocked and very angry . Shechem had done a very terrible thing . He had forced Jacob ’ s daughter to have sex with him . He had done something that should never be done in Israel .
NIRV	Genesis	34	8	But Hamor said to Jacob and his sons , “ My son Shechem wants your daughter . Please give her to him to be his wife .
NIRV	Genesis	34	9	Let your people and ours get married to each other . Give us your daughters as our wives . You can have our daughters as your wives .
NIRV	Genesis	34	10	You can live among us . Here is the land . Live in it . Trade in it . Buy property in it. ”
NIRV	Genesis	34	11	Then Shechem spoke to Dinah ’ s father and brothers . He said , “ I want to please you . I ’ ll give you anything you ask for .
NIRV	Genesis	34	12	Make the price for the bride as high as you want to . I ’ ll pay you whatever you ask . Just give me the young woman . I want to marry her. ”
NIRV	Genesis	34	13	Their sister Dinah had been raped . So Jacob ’ s sons lied to Shechem and his father Hamor .
NIRV	Genesis	34	14	They said to them , “ We can ’ t do it . We can ’ t give our sister to a man who isn ’ t circumcised . That would bring shame on us .
NIRV	Genesis	34	15	We ’ ll agree , but only on one condition . You will have to become like us . You will have to circumcise all your males .
NIRV	Genesis	34	16	Then we ’ ll give you our daughters as your wives . And we ’ ll take your daughters as our wives . We ’ ll live among you and become one big family with you .
NIRV	Genesis	34	17	But if you won ’ t agree to be circumcised , then we ’ ll take our sister and go. ”
NIRV	Genesis	34	18	Their offer seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem .
NIRV	Genesis	34	19	The young man was the most honored of all his father ’ s family . He didn ’ t lose any time in doing what Dinah ’ s father and brothers had said , because he was delighted with Jacob ’ s daughter .
NIRV	Genesis	34	20	Hamor and his son Shechem went to the city gate . They spoke to the other men there .
NIRV	Genesis	34	21	“ These men are friendly toward us , ” they said . “ Let them live in our land . Let them trade in it . The land has plenty of room for them . We can marry their daughters . And they can marry ours .
NIRV	Genesis	34	22	But they will agree to live with us as one big family only on one condition . All our males must be circumcised , just as they are .
NIRV	Genesis	34	23	Won ’ t their livestock and their property belong to us ? Won ’ t all their animals become ours ? So let ’ s say yes to them . Then they ’ ll live among us. ”
NIRV	Genesis	34	24	All the men who went out through the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem . So every male in the city was circumcised .
NIRV	Genesis	34	25	Three days later , all of them were still in pain . Then Simeon and Levi took their swords . They were Jacob ’ s sons and Dinah ’ s brothers . They attacked the city when the people didn ’ t expect it . They killed every male .
NIRV	Genesis	34	26	They also used their swords to kill Hamor and his son Shechem . Then they took Dinah from Shechem ’ s house and left .
NIRV	Genesis	34	27	Jacob ’ s other sons found the dead bodies . They robbed the city where their sister had been raped .
NIRV	Genesis	34	28	They took the flocks and herds and donkeys . They took everything in the city and in the fields .
NIRV	Genesis	34	29	They carried everything away . And they took all the women and children . They took away everything in the houses .
NIRV	Genesis	34	30	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi , “ You have brought trouble on me . Now I ’ m like a very bad smell to the Canaanites and Perizzites who live in this land . There aren ’ t many of us . They may join together against me and attack me . Then I and my family will be destroyed. ”

NIRV	Genesis	35	35	Then God said to Jacob , “ Go up to Bethel and live there . Build an altar there to honor me . That ’ s where I appeared to you when you were running away from your brother Esau. ”
NIRV	Genesis	35	2	So Jacob spoke to his family and to everyone with him . He said , “ Get rid of the statues of false gods you have with you . Make yourselves pure by washing and changing your clothes .
NIRV	Genesis	35	3	Come , let ’ s go up to Bethel . There I ’ ll build an altar to honor God . He answered me when I was in trouble . He ’ s been with me everywhere I ’ ve gone. ”

NIRV	Genesis	35	18	But Rachel was dying . As she took her last breath , she named her son Ben-Oni . But his father named him Benjamin .
NIRV	Genesis	35	19	So Rachel died . She was buried beside the road to Ephrath . Ephrath was also called Bethlehem .

NIRV	Genesis	37	37	Jacob lived in the land of Canaan . It ’ s the land where his father had stayed .
NIRV	Genesis	37	2	Here is the story of the family line of Jacob . Joseph was a young man . He was
NIRV	Genesis	37	17	“ They ’ ve moved on from here , ” the man answered . “ I heard them say , ‘ Let ’ s go to Dothan. ’ ” So Joseph went to look for his brothers . He found them near Dothan .
NIRV	Genesis	37	3	Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons . That ’ s because Joseph had been born to him when he was old . Israel made him a beautiful robe .
NIRV	Genesis	37	4	Joseph ’ s brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them . So they hated Joseph . They couldn ’ t even speak one kind word to him .
NIRV	Genesis	37	5	Joseph had a dream . When he told it to his brothers , they hated him even more .
NIRV	Genesis	37	6	He said to them , “ Listen to the dream I had .
NIRV	Genesis	37	7	We were tying up bundles of grain out in the field . Suddenly my bundle stood up straight . Your bundles gathered around my bundle and bowed down to it. ”
NIRV	Genesis	37	8	His brothers said to him , “ Do you plan to be king over us ? Will you really rule over us ? ” So they hated him even more because of his dream . They didn ’ t like what he had said .
NIRV	Genesis	37	9	Then Joseph had another dream . He told it to his brothers . “ Listen , ” he said . “ I had another dream . This time the sun and moon and
NIRV	Genesis	37	11	His brothers were jealous of him . But his father kept the dreams in mind . Joseph Is Sold by His Brothers
NIRV	Genesis	37	10	He told his father as well as his brothers . Then his father rebuked him . He said , “ What about this dream you had ? Will your mother and I and your brothers really do that ? Will we really come and bow down to the ground in front of you ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	37	12	Joseph ’ s brothers had gone to take care of their father ’ s flocks near Shechem .
NIRV	Genesis	37	13	Israel said to Joseph , “ As you know , your brothers are taking care of the flocks near Shechem . Come . I ’ m going to send you to them. ” “ All right , ” Joseph replied .
NIRV	Genesis	37	14	So Israel said to him , “ Go to your brothers . See how they are doing . Also see how the flocks are doing . Then come back and tell me. ” So he sent him away from the Hebron Valley . Joseph arrived at Shechem .
NIRV	Genesis	37	15	A man found him wandering around in the fields . He asked Joseph , “ What are you looking for ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	37	16	He replied , “ I ’ m looking for my brothers . Can you tell me where they are taking care of their flocks ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	37	18	But they saw him a long way off . Before he reached them , they made plans to kill him .
NIRV	Genesis	37	19	“ Here comes that dreamer ! ” they said to one another .
NIRV	Genesis	37	20	“ Come . Let ’ s kill him . Let ’ s throw him into one of these empty wells . Let ’ s say that a wild animal ate him up . Then we ’ ll see whether his dreams will come true. ”
NIRV	Genesis	37	21	Reuben heard them talking . He tried to save Joseph from them . “ Let ’ s not take his life , ” he said .
NIRV	Genesis	37	22	“ Don ’ t spill any of his blood . Throw him into this empty well here in the desert . But don ’ t harm him yourselves. ” Reuben said that to save Joseph from them . He was hoping he could take him back to his father .
NIRV	Genesis	37	23	When Joseph came to his brothers , he was wearing his beautiful robe . They took it away from him .
NIRV	Genesis	37	24	And they threw him into the well . The well was empty . There wasn ’ t any water in it .
NIRV	Genesis	37	25	Then they sat down to eat their meal . As they did , they saw some Ishmaelite traders coming from Gilead . Their camels were loaded with spices , lotion and myrrh . They were on their way to take them down to Egypt .
NIRV	Genesis	37	26	Judah said to his brothers , “ What will we gain if we kill our brother and try to cover up what we ’ ve done ?
NIRV	Genesis	37	27	Come . Let ’ s sell him to these traders . Let ’ s not harm him ourselves . After all , he ’ s our brother . He ’ s our own flesh and blood. ” Judah ’ s brothers agreed with him .
NIRV	Genesis	37	28	The traders from Midian came by . Joseph ’ s brothers pulled him up out of the well . They sold him to the Ishmaelite traders for eight ounces of silver . Then the traders took him to Egypt .
NIRV	Genesis	37	29	Later , Reuben came back to the empty well . He saw that Joseph wasn ’ t there . He was so upset that he tore his clothes .
NIRV	Genesis	37	30	He went back to his brothers and said , “ The boy isn ’ t there ! Now what should I do ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	37	31	Then they got Joseph ’ s beautiful robe . They killed a goat and dipped the robe in the blood .
NIRV	Genesis	37	32	They took the robe back to their father . They said , “ We found this . Take a look at it . See if it ’ s your son ’ s robe. ”
NIRV	Genesis	37	33	Jacob recognized it . He said , “ It ’ s my son ’ s robe ! A wild animal has eaten him up . Joseph must have been torn to pieces. ”
NIRV	Genesis	37	34	Jacob tore his clothes . He put on the rough clothing people wear when they ’ re sad . Then he mourned for his son many days .
NIRV	Genesis	37	35	All Jacob ’ s other sons and daughters came to comfort him . But they weren ’ t able to . He said , “ I will continue to mourn until I go down into the grave to be with my son. ” So Joseph ’ s father mourned for him .
NIRV	Genesis	37	36	But the traders from Midian sold Joseph to Potiphar in Egypt . Potiphar was one of Pharaoh ’ s officials . He was the captain of the palace guard . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	38	38	At that time , Judah left his brothers . He went down to stay with a man named Hirah from the town of Adullam .
NIRV	Genesis	38	2	There Judah met the daughter of a man from Canaan . His name was Shua . Judah married her and slept with her .
NIRV	Genesis	38	3	She became pregnant and had a son . They named him Er .
NIRV	Genesis	38	4	She became pregnant again and had another son . She named him Onan .
NIRV	Genesis	38	5	She had still another son . She named him Shelah . He was born at Kezib .
NIRV	Genesis	38	6	Judah got a wife for his oldest son Er . Her name was Tamar .
NIRV	Genesis	38	7	But Judah ’ s oldest son Er was evil in the Lord ’ s eyes . So the Lord put him to death .
NIRV	Genesis	38	8	Then Judah said to Onan , “ Sleep with your brother ’ s wife . After all , you are her brother-in-law . So carry out your duty to her . Provide children for your brother. ”
NIRV	Genesis	38	9	But Onan knew that the children wouldn ’ t belong to him . So every time he slept with his brother ’ s wife , he spilled his semen on the ground . He did it so he wouldn ’ t provide children for his brother .
NIRV	Genesis	38	10	What he did was evil in the Lord ’ s eyes . So the Lord put him to death also .
NIRV	Genesis	38	11	Then Judah spoke to his daughter-in-law Tamar . He said , “ Live as a widow in your father ’ s home . Wait there until my son Shelah grows up. ” Judah was thinking , “ Shelah might die too , just like his brothers. ” So Tamar went to live in her father ’ s home .
NIRV	Genesis	38	12	After a long time Judah ’ s wife died . She was the daughter of Shua . When Judah got over his sadness , he went up to Timnah . His friend Hirah from Adullam went with him . Men were clipping the wool from Judah ’ s sheep at Timnah .
NIRV	Genesis	38	13	Tamar was told , “ Your father-in-law is on his way to Timnah to clip the wool from his sheep. ”
NIRV	Genesis	38	14	So she took off her widow ’ s clothes . She covered her face with a veil so people wouldn ’ t know who she was . Then she sat down at the entrance to Enaim . Enaim is on the road to Timnah . Tamar knew that Shelah had grown up . But she hadn ’ t been given to him as his wife .
NIRV	Genesis	38	15	Judah saw her . He thought she was a prostitute because she had covered her face with a veil .
NIRV	Genesis	38	16	He didn ’ t realize that she was his daughter-in-law . He went over to her by the side of the road . He said , “ Come . Let me sleep with you. ” “ What will you give me to sleep with you ? ” she asked .
NIRV	Genesis	38	17	“ I ’ ll send you a young goat from my flock , ” he said . “ Will you give me something that belongs to you ? ” she asked . “ I ’ ll keep it until you send the goat. ”
NIRV	Genesis	38	18	He said , “ What should I give you ? ” “ Give me your official seal and the string that it hangs from , ” she answered . “ And give me your walking stick. ” So he gave them to her . Then he slept with her . And she became pregnant by him .
NIRV	Genesis	38	19	After she left , she took off her veil . She put on her widow ’ s clothes again .
NIRV	Genesis	38	20	Judah sent his friend Hirah with the young goat he had promised . He wanted to get back what he had given to the woman . But his friend Hirah couldn ’ t find her .
NIRV	Genesis	38	21	He asked the men who lived at Enaim , “ Where ’ s the temple prostitute ? She used to sit beside the road here. ” “ There hasn ’ t been any temple prostitute here , ” they said .
NIRV	Genesis	38	22	So Hirah went back to Judah . He said , “ I couldn ’ t find her . Besides , the men who lived there didn ’ t know anything about her . They said , ‘ There hasn ’ t been any temple prostitute here. ’ ”
NIRV	Genesis	38	23	Then Judah said , “ Let her keep what she has . I don ’ t want people making fun of us . After all , I did send her this young goat . We can ’ t help it if you couldn ’ t find her. ”
NIRV	Genesis	38	24	About three months later people brought word to Judah . They said , “ Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of being a prostitute . Now she ’ s pregnant. ” Judah said , “ Bring her out ! Have her burned to death ! ”
NIRV	Genesis	38	25	As Tamar was being brought out , she sent a message to her father-in-law . She said , “ I am pregnant by the man who owns these. ” She continued , “ Do you recognize this seal and string and walking stick ? Do you know who they belong to ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	38	26	Judah recognized them . He said , “ She ’ s a better person than I am . I should have given her to my son Shelah , but I didn ’ t. ” Judah never slept with Tamar again .
NIRV	Genesis	38	27	The time came for Tamar to have her baby . There were twin boys inside her .
NIRV	Genesis	38	28	As the babies were being born , one of them stuck out his hand . So the woman helping Tamar took a bright red thread . The woman tied it on the baby ’ s wrist . She said , “ This one came out first. ”
NIRV	Genesis	38	29	But he pulled his hand back , and his brother came out first instead . She said , “ Just look at how you have forced your way out ! ” So he was called Perez .
NIRV	Genesis	38	30	Then his brother , who had the red thread on his wrist , came out . So he was named Zerah . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	39	39	Joseph had been taken down to Egypt . An Egyptian named Potiphar had bought him from the Ishmaelite traders who had taken him there . Potiphar was one of Pharaoh ’ s officials . He was the captain of the palace guard .
NIRV	Genesis	39	2	The Lord was with Joseph . He gave him great success . Joseph lived in Potiphar ’ s house .
NIRV	Genesis	39	3	Joseph ’ s master saw that the Lord was with him . He saw that the Lord made Joseph successful in everything he did .
NIRV	Genesis	39	4	So Potiphar was pleased with Joseph and made him his attendant . He put Joseph in charge of his house . He trusted Joseph to take care of everything he owned .
NIRV	Genesis	39	5	From that time on , the Lord blessed Potiphar ’ s family and servants because of Joseph . He blessed everything Potiphar had in his house and field .
NIRV	Genesis	39	6	So Joseph took good care of everything Potiphar owned . With Joseph in charge , Potiphar didn ’ t have to worry about anything except the food he ate . Joseph was strong and handsome .
NIRV	Genesis	39	7	After a while , his master ’ s wife noticed Joseph . She said to him , “ Come to bed with me ! ”
NIRV	Genesis	39	8	But he refused . “ My master has put me in charge , ” he told her . “ Now he doesn ’ t have to worry about anything in the house . He trusts me to take care of everything he owns .
NIRV	Genesis	39	9	No one in this house is in a higher position than I am . My master hasn ’ t held anything back from me , except you . You are his wife . So how could I do an evil thing like that ? How could I sin against God ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	39	10	She spoke to Joseph day after day . But he told her he wouldn ’ t go to bed with her . He didn ’ t even want to be with her .
NIRV	Genesis	39	11	One day Joseph went into the house to take care of his duties . None of the family servants was inside .
NIRV	Genesis	39	12	Potiphar ’ s wife grabbed him by his coat . “ Come to bed with me ! ” she said . But he left his coat in her hand . And he ran out of the house .
NIRV	Genesis	39	13	She saw that he had left his coat in her hand and had run out of the house .
NIRV	Genesis	39	14	So she called her servants . “ Look , ” she said to them , “ this Hebrew slave has been brought here to make fun of us ! He came in here to force me to have sex with him . But I screamed for help .
NIRV	Genesis	39	15	He heard my scream . So he left his coat beside me and ran out of the house. ”
NIRV	Genesis	39	16	She kept Joseph ’ s coat with her until Potiphar came home .
NIRV	Genesis	39	17	Then she told him her story . She said , “ That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to rape me .
NIRV	Genesis	39	18	But I screamed for help . So he left his coat beside me and ran out of the house. ”
NIRV	Genesis	39	19	Potiphar ’ s wife told him , “ That ’ s how your slave treated me. ” When Joseph ’ s master heard her story , he became very angry .
NIRV	Genesis	39	20	So he put Joseph in prison . It was the place where the king ’ s prisoners were kept . While Joseph was there in the prison ,
NIRV	Genesis	39	21	the Lord was with him . He was kind to him . So the man running the prison was pleased with Joseph .
NIRV	Genesis	39	22	He put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners . He made him responsible for everything done there .
NIRV	Genesis	39	23	The man who ran the prison didn ’ t pay attention to anything in Joseph ’ s care . That ’ s because the Lord was with Joseph . He gave Joseph success in everything he did . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	40	40	Some time later , the Egyptian king ’ s baker and wine taster did something their master didn ’ t like .
NIRV	Genesis	40	2	So Pharaoh became angry with his two officials , the chief wine taster and the chief baker .
NIRV	Genesis	40	3	He put them in prison in the house of the captain of the palace guard . It was the same prison where Joseph was kept .
NIRV	Genesis	40	4	The captain put Joseph in charge of those men . So Joseph took care of them . Some time passed while they were in prison .
NIRV	Genesis	40	5	Then each of the two men had a dream . The men were the Egyptian king ’ s baker and wine taster . They were being held in prison . Both of them had dreams the same night . Each of their dreams had its own meaning .
NIRV	Genesis	40	6	Joseph came to them the next morning . He saw that they were sad .
NIRV	Genesis	40	7	They were Pharaoh ’ s officials , and they were in prison with Joseph in his master ’ s house . So he asked them , “ Why do you look so sad today ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	40	8	“ We both had dreams , ” they answered . “ But no one can tell us what they mean. ” Then Joseph said to them , “ Only God knows what dreams mean . Tell me your dreams. ”
NIRV	Genesis	40	9	So the chief wine taster told Joseph his dream . He said to him , “ In my dream I saw a vine in front of me .
NIRV	Genesis	40	10	There were three branches on the vine . As soon as it budded , it flowered . And bunches of ripe grapes grew on it .
NIRV	Genesis	40	11	Pharaoh ’ s cup was in my hand . I took the grapes . I squeezed them into Pharaoh ’ s cup . Then I put the cup in his hand. ”
NIRV	Genesis	40	12	“ Here ’ s what your dream means , ” Joseph said to him . “ The three branches are three days .
NIRV	Genesis	40	13	In three days Pharaoh will let you out of prison . He ’ ll give your job back to you . And you will put Pharaoh ’ s cup in his hand . That ’ s what you used to do when you were his wine taster .
NIRV	Genesis	40	14	But when everything is going well with you , remember me . Do me a favor . Speak to Pharaoh about me . Get me out of this prison .
NIRV	Genesis	40	15	I was taken away from the land of the Hebrews by force . Even here I haven ’ t done anything to be put in prison for. ”
NIRV	Genesis	40	16	The chief baker saw that Joseph had given a positive meaning to the wine taster ’ s dream . So he said to Joseph , “ I had a dream too . There were three baskets of bread on my head .
NIRV	Genesis	40	17	All kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh were in the top basket . But the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head. ”
NIRV	Genesis	40	18	“ Here ’ s what your dream means , ” Joseph said . “ The three baskets are three days .
NIRV	Genesis	40	19	In three days Pharaoh will cut your head off . Then he will stick a pole through your body and set the pole up . The birds will eat your flesh. ”
NIRV	Genesis	40	20	The third day was Pharaoh ’ s birthday . He had a feast prepared for all his officials . He brought the chief wine taster and the chief baker out of prison . He did it in front of his officials .
NIRV	Genesis	40	21	He gave the chief wine taster ’ s job back to him . Once again the wine taster put the cup into Pharaoh ’ s hand .
NIRV	Genesis	40	22	But Pharaoh had a pole stuck through the chief baker ’ s body . Then he had the pole set up . Everything happened just as Joseph had told them when he explained their dreams .
NIRV	Genesis	40	23	But the chief wine taster didn ’ t remember Joseph . In fact , he forgot all about him . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	41	41	So Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ I ’ m putting you in charge of the whole land of Egypt. ”
NIRV	Genesis	41	2	Seven cows came up out of the river . They looked healthy and fat . They were eating some of the tall grass growing along the river .
NIRV	Genesis	41	3	After them , seven other cows came up out of the Nile . They looked ugly and skinny . They were standing beside the other cows on the riverbank .
NIRV	Genesis	41	4	The ugly , skinny cows ate up the seven cows that looked healthy and fat . Then Pharaoh woke up .
NIRV	Genesis	41	5	He fell asleep again and had a second dream . In that dream , seven heads of grain were growing on one stem . They were healthy and good .
NIRV	Genesis	41	6	After them , seven other heads of grain came up . They were thin and dried up by the east wind .
NIRV	Genesis	41	7	The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy , full heads . Then Pharaoh woke up . It had been a dream .
NIRV	Genesis	41	8	In the morning he was worried . So he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt . Pharaoh told them his dreams . But no one could tell him what they meant .
NIRV	Genesis	41	9	Then the chief wine taster spoke up . He said to Pharaoh , “ Now I remember that I ’ ve done something wrong .
NIRV	Genesis	41	10	Pharaoh was once angry with his servants . He put me and the chief baker in prison . We were in the house of the captain of the palace guard .
NIRV	Genesis	41	11	Each of us had a dream the same night . Each dream had its own meaning .
NIRV	Genesis	41	12	A young Hebrew servant was there with us . He was a servant of the captain of the guard . We told him our dreams . And he explained them to us . He told each of us the meaning of our dreams .
NIRV	Genesis	41	13	Things turned out exactly as he said they would . I was given back my job . The other man had a pole stuck through his body. ”
NIRV	Genesis	41	14	So Pharaoh sent for Joseph . He was quickly brought out of the prison . Joseph shaved and changed his clothes . Then he came to Pharaoh .
NIRV	Genesis	41	15	Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ I had a dream . No one can tell me what it means . But I ’ ve heard that when you hear a dream you can explain it. ”
NIRV	Genesis	41	16	“ I can ’ t do it , ” Joseph replied to Pharaoh . “ But God will give Pharaoh the answer he wants. ”
NIRV	Genesis	41	17	Then Pharaoh told Joseph what he had dreamed . He said , “ I was standing on the bank of the Nile River .
NIRV	Genesis	41	18	Seven cows came up out of the river . They were fat and looked healthy . They were eating the tall grass growing along the river .
NIRV	Genesis	41	19	After them , seven other cows came up . They were bony and very ugly and thin . I had never seen such ugly cows in the whole land of Egypt .
NIRV	Genesis	41	20	The thin , ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first .
NIRV	Genesis	41	21	But no one could tell that the thin cows had eaten the fat cows . That ’ s because the thin cows looked just as ugly as they had before . Then I woke up .
NIRV	Genesis	41	22	“ In my dream I also saw seven heads of grain . They were full and good . They were all growing on one stem .
NIRV	Genesis	41	23	After them , seven other heads of grain came up . They were weak and thin and dried up by the east wind .
NIRV	Genesis	41	24	The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads . I told my dream to the magicians . But none of them could explain it to me. ”
NIRV	Genesis	41	25	Then Joseph said to Pharaoh , “ Both of Pharaoh ’ s dreams have the same meaning . God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do .
NIRV	Genesis	41	26	The seven good cows are seven years . And the seven good heads of grain are seven years . Both dreams mean the same thing .
NIRV	Genesis	41	27	The seven thin , ugly cows that came up later are seven years . So are the seven worthless heads of grain dried up by the east wind . They are seven years when there won ’ t be enough food .
NIRV	Genesis	41	28	“ It ’ s just as I said to Pharaoh . God has shown Pharaoh what he ’ s about to do .
NIRV	Genesis	41	29	Seven years with plenty of food are coming to the whole land of Egypt .
NIRV	Genesis	41	30	years old when he began serving Pharaoh , the king of Egypt . He left Pharaoh ’ s palace and traveled all over Egypt .
NIRV	Genesis	41	31	There won ’ t be anything left to remind people of the years when there was plenty of food in the land . That ’ s how bad the hunger that follows will be .
NIRV	Genesis	41	32	God gave the dream to Pharaoh in two forms . That ’ s because the matter has been firmly decided by God . And it ’ s because God will do it soon .
NIRV	Genesis	41	33	“ So Pharaoh should look for a wise and understanding man . He should put him in charge of the land of Egypt .
NIRV	Genesis	41	34	Pharaoh should appoint officials to be in charge of the land . They should take a fifth of the harvest in Egypt during the seven years when there ’ s plenty of food .
NIRV	Genesis	41	35	They should collect all the extra food of the good years that are coming . Pharaoh should give them authority to store up the grain . They should keep it in the cities for food .
NIRV	Genesis	41	36	The grain should be stored up for the country to use later . It will be needed during the seven years when there isn ’ t enough food in Egypt . Then the country won ’ t be destroyed just because it doesn ’ t have enough food. ”
NIRV	Genesis	41	37	The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and all his officials .
NIRV	Genesis	41	38	So Pharaoh said to them , “ The spirit of God is in this man . We can ’ t find anyone else like him , can we ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	41	39	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ God has made all this known to you . No one is as wise and understanding as you are .
NIRV	Genesis	41	40	You will be in charge of my palace . All my people must obey your orders . I will be greater than you only because I ’ m the one who sits on the throne. ” Joseph Is Put in Charge of Egypt
NIRV	Genesis	41	42	Then Pharaoh took from his finger the ring he used to give his official stamp . He put it on Joseph ’ s finger . He dressed him in robes made out of fine linen . He put a gold chain around Joseph ’ s neck .
NIRV	Genesis	41	43	He also had him ride in a chariot . Joseph was now next in command after Pharaoh . People went in front of Joseph and shouted , “ Get down on your knees ! ” By doing all these things , Pharaoh put Joseph in charge of the whole land of Egypt .
NIRV	Genesis	41	44	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ I am Pharaoh . But unless you give an order , no one will do anything in the whole land of Egypt. ”
NIRV	Genesis	41	45	Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah . He gave Joseph a wife . She was Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera . Potiphera was the priest of On . Joseph traveled all over the land of Egypt .
NIRV	Genesis	41	46	Joseph was
NIRV	Genesis	41	47	During the seven years there was plenty of food . The land produced more than the people needed .
NIRV	Genesis	41	48	Joseph collected all the extra food produced in those seven years in Egypt . He stored it in the cities . In each city he stored up the food grown in the fields around it .
NIRV	Genesis	41	49	Joseph stored up huge amounts of grain . There was as much of it as sand by the sea . There was so much grain it couldn ’ t be measured . So Joseph stopped keeping records of it .
NIRV	Genesis	41	50	Before the years when there wasn ’ t enough food , two sons were born to Joseph . He had them by Asenath , the daughter of Potiphera . Potiphera was the priest of On .
NIRV	Genesis	41	51	Joseph named his first son Manasseh . That ’ s because he said , “ God has made me forget all my trouble and my father ’ s whole family. ”
NIRV	Genesis	41	52	He named the second son Ephraim . That ’ s because he said , “ God has given me children in the land where I ’ ve suffered so much. ”
NIRV	Genesis	41	53	The seven years when there was plenty of food in Egypt came to an end .
NIRV	Genesis	41	54	Then the seven years when there wasn ’ t enough food began . It happened just as Joseph had said it would . There wasn ’ t enough food in any of the other lands . But in the whole land of Egypt there was food .
NIRV	Genesis	41	55	When all the people of Egypt began to get hungry , they cried out to Pharaoh for food . He told all the Egyptians , “ Go to Joseph . Do what he tells you. ”
NIRV	Genesis	41	56	There wasn ’ t enough food anywhere in the country . So Joseph opened the storerooms . He sold grain to the Egyptians because people were very hungry all over Egypt .
NIRV	Genesis	41	57	People from all over the world came to Egypt . They came to buy grain from Joseph . That ’ s because people were very hungry everywhere . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	42	42	Jacob found out that there was grain in Egypt . So he said to his sons , “ Why do you just keep looking at one another ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	42	2	He continued , “ I ’ ve heard there ’ s grain in Egypt . Go down there . Buy some for us . Then we ’ ll live and not die. ”
NIRV	Genesis	42	3	So ten of Joseph ’ s brothers went down to Egypt to buy grain there .
NIRV	Genesis	42	4	But Jacob didn ’ t send Joseph ’ s brother Benjamin with them . He was afraid Benjamin might be harmed .
NIRV	Genesis	42	5	Israel ’ s sons were among the people who went to buy grain . There wasn ’ t enough food in the land of Canaan .
NIRV	Genesis	42	6	Joseph was the governor of the land . He was the one who sold grain to all its people . When Joseph ’ s brothers arrived , they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground .
NIRV	Genesis	42	7	As soon as Joseph saw his brothers , he recognized them . But he pretended to be a stranger . He spoke to them in a mean way . “ Where do you come from ? ” he asked . “ From the land of Canaan , ” they replied . “ We ’ ve come to buy food. ”
NIRV	Genesis	42	8	Joseph recognized his brothers , but they didn ’ t recognize him .
NIRV	Genesis	42	9	Then Joseph remembered his dreams about them . So he said to them , “ You are spies ! You have come to see the places where our land isn ’ t guarded very well. ”
NIRV	Genesis	42	10	“ No , sir , ” they answered . “ We ’ ve come to buy food .
NIRV	Genesis	42	11	All of us are the sons of one man . We ’ re honest men . We aren ’ t spies. ”
NIRV	Genesis	42	12	brothers . All of us were the sons of one father . But now one brother is gone . And our youngest brother is with our father in Canaan. ’
NIRV	Genesis	42	13	But they replied , “ We were
NIRV	Genesis	42	14	Joseph said to them , “ I still say you are spies !
NIRV	Genesis	42	15	So I ’ m going to test you . And here ’ s the test . You can be sure that you won ’ t leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here . You can be just as sure of this as you are sure that Pharaoh lives . I give you my word that you won ’ t leave here unless your brother comes .
NIRV	Genesis	42	16	Send one of you back to get your brother . The rest of you will be kept in prison . I ’ ll test your words . Then we ’ ll find out whether you are telling the truth . You can be sure that Pharaoh lives . And you can be just as sure that if you aren ’ t telling the truth , we ’ ll know that you are spies ! ”
NIRV	Genesis	42	17	So Joseph kept all of them under guard for three days .
NIRV	Genesis	42	18	On the third day , Joseph spoke to them again . He said , “ Do what I say . Then you will live , because I have respect for God .
NIRV	Genesis	42	19	If you are honest men , let one of your brothers stay here in prison . The rest of you may go and take grain back to your hungry families .
NIRV	Genesis	42	20	But you must bring your youngest brother to me . That will prove that your words are true . Then you won ’ t die. ” So they did what he said .
NIRV	Genesis	42	21	They said to one another , “ God is surely punishing us because of our brother . We saw how upset he was when he begged us to let him live . But we wouldn ’ t listen . That ’ s why all this trouble has come to us. ”
NIRV	Genesis	42	22	Reuben replied , “ Didn ’ t I tell you not to sin against the boy ? But you wouldn ’ t listen ! Now we ’ re being paid back for killing him. ”
NIRV	Genesis	42	23	They didn ’ t realize that Joseph could understand what they were saying . He was using someone else to explain their words to him in the Egyptian language .
NIRV	Genesis	42	24	Joseph turned away from his brothers and began to weep . Then he came back and spoke to them again . He had Simeon taken and tied up right there in front of them .
NIRV	Genesis	42	25	Joseph gave orders to have their bags filled with grain . He had each man ’ s money put back into his sack . He also made sure they were given food for their journey .
NIRV	Genesis	42	26	Then the brothers loaded their grain on their donkeys and left .
NIRV	Genesis	42	27	When night came , they stopped . One of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey . He saw his money in the top of his sack .
NIRV	Genesis	42	28	“ My money has been given back , ” he said to his brothers . “ Here it is in my sack. ” They had a sinking feeling in their hearts . They began to tremble . They turned to one another and said , “ What has God done to us ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	42	29	They came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan . They told him everything that had happened to them . They said ,
NIRV	Genesis	42	30	“ The man who is the governor of the land spoke to us in a mean way . He treated us as if we were spying on the land .
NIRV	Genesis	42	31	But we said to him , ‘ We ’ re honest men . We aren ’ t spies .
NIRV	Genesis	42	32	We were
NIRV	Genesis	42	33	“ Then the man who is the governor of the land spoke to us . He said , ‘ Here ’ s how I will know whether you are honest men . Leave one of your brothers here with me . Take food for your hungry families and go .
NIRV	Genesis	42	34	But bring your youngest brother to me . Then I ’ ll know that you are honest men and not spies . I ’ ll give your brother back to you . And you will be free to trade in the land. ’ ”
NIRV	Genesis	42	35	They began emptying their sacks . There in each man ’ s sack was his bag of money ! When they and their father saw the money bags , they were scared to death .
NIRV	Genesis	42	36	Their father Jacob said to them , “ You have taken my children away from me . Joseph is gone . Simeon is gone . Now you want to take Benjamin . Everything is going against me ! ”
NIRV	Genesis	42	37	Then Reuben spoke to his father . He said , “ You can put both of my sons to death if I don ’ t bring Benjamin back to you . Trust me to take care of him . I ’ ll bring him back. ”
NIRV	Genesis	42	38	But Jacob said , “ My son will not go down there with you . His brother is dead . He ’ s the only one left here with me . Suppose he ’ s harmed on the journey you are taking . Then I would die as a sad old man. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	43	43	There still wasn ’ t enough food anywhere in the land .
NIRV	Genesis	43	2	After a while Jacob ’ s family had eaten all the grain the brothers had brought from Egypt . So their father said to them , “ Go back . Buy us a little more food. ”
NIRV	Genesis	43	3	But Judah said to him , “ The man gave us a strong warning . He said , ‘ You won ’ t see my face again unless your brother Benjamin is with you. ’
NIRV	Genesis	43	4	So send our brother along with us . Then we ’ ll go down and buy food for you .
NIRV	Genesis	43	5	If you won ’ t send him , we won ’ t go down . The man said to us , ‘ You won ’ t see my face again unless your brother is with you. ’ ”
NIRV	Genesis	43	6	Israel asked , “ Why did you bring this trouble to me ? Why did you tell the man you had another brother ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	43	7	They replied , “ The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family . He asked us , ‘ Is your father still living ? Do you have another brother ? ’ We just answered his questions . How could we possibly know he would say , ‘ Bring your brother down here ’ ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	43	8	Judah spoke to Israel his father . “ Send the boy along with me , ” he said . “ We ’ ll go right away . Then we and you and our children will live and not die .
NIRV	Genesis	43	9	I myself promise to keep Benjamin safe . You can blame me if I don ’ t bring him back to you . I ’ ll set him right here in front of you . If I don ’ t , you can put the blame on me for the rest of my life .
NIRV	Genesis	43	10	As it is , we ’ ve already waited too long . We could have made the trip to Egypt and back twice by now. ”
NIRV	Genesis	43	11	Then their father Israel spoke to them . He said , “ If that ’ s the way it has to be , then do what I tell you . Put some of the best things from our land in your bags . Take them down to the man as a gift . Take some lotion and a little honey . Take some spices and myrrh . Take some pistachio nuts and almonds .
NIRV	Genesis	43	12	Take twice the amount of money with you . You have to give back the money that was put in your sacks . Maybe it was a mistake .
NIRV	Genesis	43	13	Also take your brother . Go back to the man at once .
NIRV	Genesis	43	14	May the Mighty God cause him to show you mercy . May the man let your other brother and Benjamin come back with you . And if I lose my sons , I lose them. ”
NIRV	Genesis	43	15	So the men took the gifts . They took twice the amount of money . They also took Benjamin . They hurried down to Egypt and went to Joseph .
NIRV	Genesis	43	16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them , he spoke to the manager of his house . “ Take these men to my house , ” he said . “ Kill an animal and prepare a meal . I want them to eat with me at noon. ”
NIRV	Genesis	43	17	The manager did what Joseph told him to do . He took the men to Joseph ’ s house .
NIRV	Genesis	43	18	They were frightened when they were taken to Joseph ’ s house . They thought , “ We were brought here because of the money that was put back in our sacks the first time . He wants to attack us and overpower us . Then he can hold us as slaves and take our donkeys. ”
NIRV	Genesis	43	19	So they went up to Joseph ’ s manager . They spoke to him at the entrance to the house .
NIRV	Genesis	43	20	“ Please , sir , ” they said . “ We came down here the first time to buy food .
NIRV	Genesis	43	21	We opened our sacks at the place where we stopped for the night . Each of us found in our sacks the exact amount of the money we had paid . So we ’ ve brought it back with us .
NIRV	Genesis	43	22	We ’ ve also brought more money with us to buy food . We don ’ t know who put our money in our sacks. ”
NIRV	Genesis	43	23	“ It ’ s all right , ” the manager said . “ Don ’ t be afraid . Your God , the God of your father , has given you riches in your sacks . I received your money. ” Then he brought Simeon out to them .
NIRV	Genesis	43	24	The manager took the men into Joseph ’ s house . He gave them water to wash their feet . He provided feed for their donkeys .
NIRV	Genesis	43	25	The brothers prepared their gifts for Joseph . He was planning to arrive at noon . They had heard that they were going to eat there .
NIRV	Genesis	43	26	When Joseph came home , they gave him the gifts they had brought into the house . They bowed down low in front of him .
NIRV	Genesis	43	27	He asked them how they were . Then he said , “ How is your old father you told me about ? Is he still living ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	43	28	They replied , “ Your servant our father is still alive and well. ” And they bowed down to show him honor .
NIRV	Genesis	43	29	Joseph looked around . Then he saw his brother Benjamin , his own mother ’ s son . He asked , “ Is this your youngest brother ? Is he the one you told me about ? ” He continued , “ May God be gracious to you , my son. ”
NIRV	Genesis	43	30	It moved him deeply to see his brother . So Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to cry . He went into his own room and cried there .
NIRV	Genesis	43	31	Then he washed his face and came out . He calmed down and said , “ Serve the food. ”
NIRV	Genesis	43	32	They served Joseph by himself . They served the brothers by themselves . They also served the Egyptians who ate with Joseph by themselves . Because of their beliefs , Egyptians couldn ’ t eat with Hebrews .
NIRV	Genesis	43	33	The brothers had been given places in front of Joseph . They had been seated in the order of their ages , from the oldest to the youngest . That made them look at each other in great surprise .
NIRV	Genesis	43	34	While they were eating , some food was brought to them from Joseph ’ s table . Benjamin was given five times as much as anyone else . So all Joseph ’ s brothers ate and drank a lot with him . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	44	44	Joseph told the manager of his house what to do . “ Fill the men ’ s sacks with as much food as they can carry , ” he said . “ Put each man ’ s money in his sack .
NIRV	Genesis	44	2	Then put my silver cup in the youngest one ’ s sack . Put it there along with the money he paid for his grain. ” So the manager did what Joseph told him to do .
NIRV	Genesis	44	3	When morning came , the men were sent on their way with their donkeys .
NIRV	Genesis	44	4	They hadn ’ t gone very far from the city when Joseph spoke to his manager . “ Go after those men right away , ” he said . “ Catch up with them . Say to them , ‘ My master was good to you . Why have you paid him back by doing evil ?
NIRV	Genesis	44	5	Isn ’ t this the cup my master drinks from ? Doesn ’ t he also use it to find things out ? You have done an evil thing. ’ ”
NIRV	Genesis	44	6	When the manager caught up with them , he told them what Joseph had said .
NIRV	Genesis	44	7	But they said to him , “ Why do you say these things ? We would never do anything like that !
NIRV	Genesis	44	8	We even brought back to you from Canaan the money we found in our sacks . So why would we steal silver or gold from your master ’ s house ?
NIRV	Genesis	44	9	If you find out that any of us has the cup , he will die . And the rest of us will become your slaves. ”
NIRV	Genesis	44	10	“ All right , then , ” he said . “ As you wish . The one found to have the cup will become my slave . But the rest of you will not be blamed. ”
NIRV	Genesis	44	11	Each of them quickly put his sack down on the ground and opened it .
NIRV	Genesis	44	12	Then the manager started to search . He began with the oldest and ended with the youngest . The cup was found in Benjamin ’ s sack .
NIRV	Genesis	44	13	When that happened , they were so upset they tore their clothes . Then all of them loaded their donkeys and went back to the city .
NIRV	Genesis	44	14	Joseph was still in the house when Judah and his brothers came in . They threw themselves down on the ground in front of him .
NIRV	Genesis	44	15	Joseph said to them , “ What have you done ? Don ’ t you know that a man like me has ways to find things out ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	44	16	“ What can we say to you ? ” Judah replied . “ What can we say ? How can we prove we haven ’ t done anything wrong ? God has shown you that we are guilty . We are now your slaves . All of us are , including the one found to have the cup. ”
NIRV	Genesis	44	17	But Joseph said , “ I would never do anything like that ! Only the man found to have the cup will become my slave . The rest of you may go back to your father in peace. ”
NIRV	Genesis	44	18	Then Judah went up to him . He said , “ Please , sir . Let me speak a word to you . Don ’ t be angry with me , even though you are equal to Pharaoh himself .
NIRV	Genesis	44	19	You asked us , ‘ Do you have a father or a brother ? ’
NIRV	Genesis	44	20	We answered , ‘ We have an old father . A young son was born to him when he was old . His brother is dead . He ’ s the only one of his mother ’ s sons left . And his father loves him. ’
NIRV	Genesis	44	21	“ Then you said to us , ‘ Bring him down to me . I want to see him for myself. ’
NIRV	Genesis	44	22	We said to you , ‘ The boy can ’ t leave his father . If he does , his father will die. ’
NIRV	Genesis	44	23	But you told us , ‘ Your youngest brother must come down here with you . If he doesn ’ t , you won ’ t see my face again. ’
NIRV	Genesis	44	24	So we went back to my father . We told him what you had said .
NIRV	Genesis	44	25	“ Then our father said , ‘ Go back . Buy a little more food. ’
NIRV	Genesis	44	26	But we said , ‘ We can ’ t go down . We ’ ll only go if our youngest brother goes there with us . We can ’ t even see the man ’ s face unless our youngest brother goes with us. ’
NIRV	Genesis	44	27	“ Your servant my father said to us , ‘ You know that my wife had two sons by me .
NIRV	Genesis	44	28	One of them went away from me . And I said , “ He must have been torn to pieces. ” I haven ’ t seen him since .
NIRV	Genesis	44	29	What if you take this one from me too and he is harmed ? Then you would cause me to die as a sad old man . I would go down into the grave full of pain and suffering. ’
NIRV	Genesis	44	30	“ So now , what will happen if the boy isn ’ t with us when I go back to my father ? His life depends on the boy ’ s life .
NIRV	Genesis	44	31	When he sees that the boy isn ’ t with us , he ’ ll die . Because of us , he ’ ll go down into the grave as a sad old man .
NIRV	Genesis	44	32	I promised my father I would keep the boy safe . I said , ‘ Father , I ’ ll bring him back to you . If I don ’ t , you can put the blame on me for the rest of my life. ’
NIRV	Genesis	44	33	“ Now then , please let me stay here . Let me be your slave in place of the boy . Let the boy return with his brothers .
NIRV	Genesis	44	34	How can I go back to my father if the boy isn ’ t with me ? No ! Don ’ t let me see the pain and suffering that would come to my father. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	45	45	Joseph couldn ’ t control himself anymore in front of all his attendants . He cried out , “ Have everyone leave me ! ” So there wasn ’ t anyone with Joseph when he told his brothers who he was .
NIRV	Genesis	45	2	He wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him . Everyone in Pharaoh ’ s house heard about it .
NIRV	Genesis	45	3	Joseph said to his brothers , “ I am Joseph ! Is my father still alive ? ” But his brothers weren ’ t able to answer him . They were too afraid of him .
NIRV	Genesis	45	4	Joseph said to his brothers , “ Come close to me. ” So they did . Then he said , “ I am your brother Joseph . I ’ m the one you sold into Egypt .
NIRV	Genesis	45	5	But don ’ t be upset . And don ’ t be angry with yourselves because you sold me here . God sent me ahead of you to save many lives .
NIRV	Genesis	45	6	For two years now , there hasn ’ t been enough food in the land . And for the next five years , people won ’ t be plowing or gathering crops .
NIRV	Genesis	45	7	But God sent me ahead of you to keep some of you alive on earth . He sent me here to save your lives by an act of mighty power .
NIRV	Genesis	45	8	“ So then , it wasn ’ t you who sent me here . It was God . He made me like a father to Pharaoh . He made me master of Pharaoh ’ s entire house . God made me ruler of the whole land of Egypt .
NIRV	Genesis	45	9	Now hurry back to my father . Say to him , ‘ Your son Joseph says , “ God has made me master of the whole land of Egypt . Come down to me . Don ’ t waste any time .
NIRV	Genesis	45	10	You will live in the area of Goshen . You , your children and grandchildren , your flocks and herds , and everything you have will be near me .
NIRV	Genesis	45	11	There I will provide everything you need . There are still five years to come when there won ’ t be enough food . If you don ’ t come down here , you and your family and everyone who belongs to you will lose everything. ” ’
NIRV	Genesis	45	12	“ My brothers , I am Joseph . You can see for yourselves that I am the one speaking to you . My brother Benjamin can see it too .
NIRV	Genesis	45	13	Tell my father about all the honor given to me in Egypt . Tell him about everything you have seen . And bring my father down here quickly. ”
NIRV	Genesis	45	14	Then Joseph threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept . Benjamin also hugged him and wept .
NIRV	Genesis	45	15	Joseph kissed all his brothers and wept over them . After that , his brothers talked with him .
NIRV	Genesis	45	16	The news reached Pharaoh ’ s palace that Joseph ’ s brothers had come . Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased .
NIRV	Genesis	45	17	Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Here ’ s what I want you to tell your brothers . Say to them , ‘ Load your animals . Return to the land of Canaan .
NIRV	Genesis	45	18	Bring your father and your families back to me . I ’ ll give you the best land in Egypt . You can enjoy all the good things in the land. ’
NIRV	Genesis	45	19	“ And here ’ s something else I want you to tell them . Say to them , ‘ Take some carts from Egypt . Your children and your wives can use them . Get your father and come back .
NIRV	Genesis	45	20	Don ’ t worry about the things you have back there . The best of everything in Egypt will belong to you. ’ ”
NIRV	Genesis	45	21	Then the sons of Israel did so . Joseph gave them carts , as Pharaoh had commanded . He also gave them supplies for their journey .
NIRV	Genesis	45	22	He gave new clothes to each of them . But he gave Benjamin more than seven pounds of silver . He also gave him five sets of clothes .
NIRV	Genesis	45	23	He sent his father ten male donkeys loaded with the best things from Egypt . He also sent ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other supplies for his journey .
NIRV	Genesis	45	24	Then Joseph sent his brothers away . As they were leaving he said to them , “ Don ’ t argue on the way ! ”
NIRV	Genesis	45	25	So they went up out of Egypt . They came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan .
NIRV	Genesis	45	26	They told him , “ Joseph is still alive ! In fact , he is ruler of the whole land of Egypt. ” Jacob was shocked . He didn ’ t believe them .
NIRV	Genesis	45	27	So they told him everything Joseph had said to them . Jacob saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back . That gave new life to their father Jacob .
NIRV	Genesis	45	28	Israel said , “ I believe it now ! My son Joseph is still alive . I ’ ll go and see him before I die. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	46	46	So Israel started out with everything that belonged to him . When he reached Beersheba , he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac .
NIRV	Genesis	46	2	God spoke to Israel in a vision at night . “ Jacob ! Jacob ! ” he said . “ Here I am , ” Jacob replied .
NIRV	Genesis	46	3	“ I am God . I am the God of your father , ” he said . “ Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt . There I will make you into a great nation .
NIRV	Genesis	46	4	I will go down to Egypt with you . I will surely bring you back again . And when you die , Joseph will close your eyes with his own hand. ”
NIRV	Genesis	46	5	Then Jacob left Beersheba . Israel ’ s sons put their father Jacob and their families in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to carry him .

NIRV	Genesis	46	30	Israel said to Joseph , “ I have seen for myself that you are still alive . Now I ’ m ready to die. ”
NIRV	Genesis	46	31	Then Joseph spoke to his brothers and to the rest of his father ’ s family . He said , “ I will go up and speak to Pharaoh . I ’ ll say to him , ‘ My brothers and the rest of my father ’ s family have come to me . They were living in the land of Canaan .
NIRV	Genesis	46	32	The men are shepherds . They take care of livestock . They ’ ve brought along their flocks and herds and everything they own. ’
NIRV	Genesis	46	34	You should answer , ‘ We ’ ve taken care of livestock from the time we were boys . We ’ ve done just as our fathers did. ’ It ’ s the practice of the people of Egypt not to mix with shepherds . So Pharaoh will let you settle in the area of Goshen. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	47	47	Joseph went to Pharaoh . He told him , “ My father and brothers have come from the land of Canaan . They ’ ve brought along their flocks and herds and everything they own . They are now in Goshen. ”
NIRV	Genesis	47	2	Joseph had chosen five of his brothers to meet with Pharaoh .
NIRV	Genesis	47	3	Pharaoh asked the brothers , “ What do you do for a living ? ” “ We ’ re shepherds , ” they replied to Pharaoh . “ And that ’ s what our fathers were. ”
NIRV	Genesis	47	4	They also said to him , “ We ’ ve come to live in Egypt for a while . There isn ’ t enough food anywhere in Canaan . There isn ’ t any grass for our flocks . So please let us live in Goshen. ”
NIRV	Genesis	47	5	Pharaoh said to Joseph , “ Your father and your brothers have come to you .
NIRV	Genesis	47	6	The land of Egypt is open to you . Let your father and brothers live in the best part of the land . Let them live in Goshen . Do any of them have special skills ? If they do , put them in charge of my own livestock. ”
NIRV	Genesis	47	7	Then Joseph brought his father Jacob in to meet Pharaoh . Jacob gave Pharaoh his blessing .
NIRV	Genesis	47	8	Then Pharaoh asked him , “ How old are you ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	47	9	Jacob said to Pharaoh , “ The years of my journey through life are
NIRV	Genesis	47	130	. My years have been few and hard . They aren ’ t as many as the years of my father and grandfather before me. ”
NIRV	Genesis	47	10	Jacob gave Pharaoh his blessing . Then he left him .
NIRV	Genesis	47	11	So Joseph helped his father and his brothers make their homes in Egypt . He gave them property in the best part of the land , just as Pharaoh had directed him to do . That part was known as the territory of Rameses .
NIRV	Genesis	47	12	Joseph also provided food for his father and brothers . He provided for them and the rest of his father ’ s family . He gave them enough for all their children . Joseph Saves Many Lives
NIRV	Genesis	47	13	But there wasn ’ t any food in the whole area . In fact , there wasn ’ t enough food anywhere . The people of Egypt and Canaan lost their strength because there wasn ’ t enough food to go around .
NIRV	Genesis	47	14	Joseph collected all the money in Egypt and Canaan . People paid it to him for the grain they were buying . And Joseph brought it to Pharaoh ’ s palace .
NIRV	Genesis	47	15	When the money of the people of Egypt and Canaan was gone , all the Egyptians came to Joseph . They said , “ Give us food . What good would it do you to watch us all die ? Our money is all gone. ”
NIRV	Genesis	47	16	“ Then bring your livestock , ” said Joseph . “ You say your money is gone . So I ’ ll trade you food for your livestock. ”
NIRV	Genesis	47	17	years in Egypt . He lived a total of
NIRV	Genesis	47	18	When that year was over , they came to him the next year . They said , “ We can ’ t hide the truth from you . Our money is gone . Our livestock belongs to you . We don ’ t have anything left to give you except our bodies and our land .
NIRV	Genesis	47	19	What good would it do you to watch us die ? Why should our land be destroyed ? Trade us food for ourselves and our land . Then we and our land will belong to Pharaoh . Give us some seeds so we can live and not die . We don ’ t want the land to become a desert. ”
NIRV	Genesis	47	20	So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh . All the people of Egypt sold their fields . They did that because there wasn ’ t enough food anywhere . So the land became Pharaoh ’ s .
NIRV	Genesis	47	21	Joseph made the people slaves from one end of Egypt to the other .
NIRV	Genesis	47	22	But Joseph didn ’ t buy the land that belonged to the priests . They received a regular share of food from Pharaoh . They had enough food from what Pharaoh gave them . That ’ s why they didn ’ t have to sell their land .
NIRV	Genesis	47	23	Joseph said to the people , “ I ’ ve bought you and your land today for Pharaoh . So here are some seeds for you to plant in the ground .
NIRV	Genesis	47	24	But when the crop comes in , give a fifth of it to Pharaoh . Keep the other four-fifths for yourselves . They will be seeds for the fields . And they will be food for yourselves , your children , and the other people who live with you. ”
NIRV	Genesis	47	25	“ You have saved our lives , ” they said . “ If you are pleased with us , we will be Pharaoh ’ s slaves. ”
NIRV	Genesis	47	26	So Joseph made a law about land in Egypt . It ’ s still the law today . A fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh . Only the land belonging to the priests didn ’ t become Pharaoh ’ s .
NIRV	Genesis	47	27	The people of Israel lived in Egypt in the area of Goshen . They received property there . They had children and so became many .
NIRV	Genesis	47	28	Jacob lived
NIRV	Genesis	47	147	years .
NIRV	Genesis	47	29	The time came near for Israel to die . So he sent for his son Joseph . He said to him , “ If you are pleased with me , put your hand under my thigh . Promise me that you will be kind and faithful to me . Don ’ t bury me in Egypt .
NIRV	Genesis	47	30	When I join the members of my family who have already died , carry me out of Egypt . Bury me where they are buried. ” “ I ’ ll do exactly as you say , ” Joseph said .
NIRV	Genesis	47	31	“ Give me your word that you will do it , ” Jacob said . So Joseph gave him his word . And Israel worshiped God as he leaned on the top of his walking stick . Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	48	48	Some time later Joseph was told , “ Your father is sick. ” So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him .
NIRV	Genesis	48	2	Jacob was told , “ Your son Joseph has come to you. ” So Israel became stronger and sat up in bed .
NIRV	Genesis	48	3	Jacob said to Joseph , “ The Mighty God appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan . He blessed me there .
NIRV	Genesis	48	4	He said to me , ‘ I am going to give you children . I will make your family very large . I will make you a community of nations . And I will give this land to your children after you . It will belong to them forever. ’
NIRV	Genesis	48	5	“ Now then , two sons were born to you in Egypt . It happened before I came to you here . They will be counted as my own sons . Ephraim and Manasseh will belong to me , in the same way that Reuben and Simeon belong to me .
NIRV	Genesis	48	6	Any children born to you after them will belong to you . Any territory they receive will come from the land that will be given to Ephraim and Manasseh .
NIRV	Genesis	48	7	As I was returning from Paddan , Rachel died . It made me very sad . She died in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way . We weren ’ t very far away from Ephrath . So I buried her body there beside the road to Ephrath. ” Ephrath was also called Bethlehem .
NIRV	Genesis	48	8	Israel saw Joseph ’ s sons . He asked , “ Who are they ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	48	9	“ They are the sons God has given me here , ” Joseph said to his father . Then Israel said , “ Bring them to me . I want to give them my blessing. ”
NIRV	Genesis	48	10	Israel ’ s eyes were weak because he was old . He couldn ’ t see very well . So Joseph brought his sons close to him . His father kissed them and hugged them .
NIRV	Genesis	48	11	Israel said to Joseph , “ I never thought I ’ d see your face again . But now God has let me see your children too. ”
NIRV	Genesis	48	12	Then Joseph lifted his sons off Israel ’ s knees . Joseph bowed down with his face to the ground .
NIRV	Genesis	48	13	He placed Ephraim on his right , toward Israel ’ s left hand . He placed Manasseh on his left , toward Israel ’ s right hand . Then he brought them close to Israel .
NIRV	Genesis	48	14	But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim ’ s head . He did it even though Ephraim was the younger son . He crossed his arms and put his left hand on Manasseh ’ s head . He did it even though Manasseh was the older son .
NIRV	Genesis	48	15	Then Israel gave Joseph his blessing . He said , “ May God bless these boys . He is the God of my grandfather Abraham and my father Isaac . They walked faithfully with him . He is the God who has been my shepherd all my life right up to this day .
NIRV	Genesis	48	16	He is the Angel who has saved me from all harm . May he bless these boys . May they be called by my name . May they also be called by the names of my grandfather Abraham and my father Isaac . And may the number of them greatly increase on the earth. ”
NIRV	Genesis	48	17	Joseph saw his father putting his right hand on Ephraim ’ s head . And Joseph didn ’ t like it . So he took hold of his father ’ s hand to move it over to Manasseh ’ s head .
NIRV	Genesis	48	18	Joseph said to him , “ No , my father . Here ’ s my older son . Put your right hand on his head. ”
NIRV	Genesis	48	19	But his father wouldn ’ t do it . He said , “ I know , my son . I know . He too will become a nation . He too will become great . But his younger brother will be greater than he is . His children after him will become a group of nations. ”
NIRV	Genesis	48	20	On that day , Jacob gave them his blessing . He said , “ The people of Israel will bless others in your name . They will say , ‘ May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh. ’ ” So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh .
NIRV	Genesis	48	21	Then Israel said to Joseph , “ I ’ m about to die . But God will be with all of you . He ’ ll take you back to the land of your fathers .
NIRV	Genesis	48	22	But to you , Joseph , I am giving more land than your brothers . I ’ m giving you the land I took from the Amorites . I took it with my sword and bow. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Genesis	49	49	Then Jacob sent for his sons . He said , “ Gather around me so I can tell you what will happen to you in days to come .
NIRV	Genesis	49	2	“ Sons of Jacob , come together and listen . Listen to your father Israel .
NIRV	Genesis	49	3	“ Reuben , you are my oldest son . You were my first child . You were the first sign of my strength . You were first in honor . You were first in power .
NIRV	Genesis	49	4	But you are as unsteady as water . So you won ’ t be first anymore . You had sex with my concubine on my bed . You lay on my couch and made it ‘ unclean. ’
NIRV	Genesis	49	5	“ Simeon and Levi are brothers . Their swords have killed a lot of people .
NIRV	Genesis	49	6	I won ’ t share in their plans . I won ’ t have anything to do with them . They became angry and killed people . They cut the legs of oxen just for the fun of it .
NIRV	Genesis	49	7	May the Lord put a curse on them because of their terrible anger . I will scatter them in Jacob ’ s land . I will spread them around in Israel .

NIRV	Genesis	49	10	The right to rule will not leave Judah . The ruler ’ s scepter will not be taken from between his feet . It will be his until the king it belongs to will come . The nations will obey that king .
NIRV	Genesis	49	11	He will tie his donkey to a vine . He will tie his colt to the very best branch . He will wash his clothes in wine . He will wash his robes in the red juice of grapes .

NIRV	Genesis	50	50	Joseph threw himself on his father ’ s body . He wept over him and kissed him .
NIRV	Genesis	50	2	Then Joseph talked to the doctors who served him . He told them to prepare the body of his father Israel to be buried . So the doctors prepared it .
NIRV	Genesis	50	3	They took
NIRV	Genesis	50	40	days to do it . They needed that much time to prepare a body in the right way . The Egyptians mourned for Jacob
NIRV	Genesis	50	70	days .
NIRV	Genesis	50	4	After the days of sadness had passed , Joseph went to Pharaoh ’ s officials . He said to them , “ If you are pleased with me , speak to Pharaoh for me . Tell him ,
NIRV	Genesis	50	5	‘ My father made me give my word to him . He said , “ I ’ m about to die . Bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan. ” So let me go there and bury my father . Then I ’ ll come back. ’ ”
NIRV	Genesis	50	6	Pharaoh said , “ Go there and bury your father . Do what he made you promise to do. ”
NIRV	Genesis	50	7	So Joseph went to Canaan to bury his father . All Pharaoh ’ s officials went with him . They were the important people of his court and all the leaders of Egypt .
NIRV	Genesis	50	8	Joseph ’ s family also went . His brothers and all the rest of his father ’ s family went . Only their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen .
NIRV	Genesis	50	9	Chariots and horsemen also went up with him . It was a very large group .
NIRV	Genesis	50	10	They came to Atad , a place where grain was processed . It was near the Jordan River . There they sobbed loudly and bitterly . Joseph set apart seven days of sadness to honor his father ’ s memory .
NIRV	Genesis	50	11	The Canaanites living in that area saw how sad all of them were . They said , “ The Egyptians are having a very special service for the dead. ” That ’ s why that place near the Jordan River is called Abel of the Egyptians .
NIRV	Genesis	50	12	So Jacob ’ s sons did exactly as he had commanded them .
NIRV	Genesis	50	13	They carried his body to the land of Canaan . They buried it in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre . Abraham had bought the cave as a place where he could bury his wife ’ s body . He had bought the cave and the field from Ephron , the Hittite .

NIRV	Genesis	50	15	Now that their father was dead , Joseph ’ s brothers were worried . They said , “ Remember all the bad things we did to Joseph ? What if he decides to hold those things against us ? What if he pays us back for them ? ”
NIRV	Genesis	50	16	So they sent a message to Joseph . They said , “ Your father gave us directions before he died .
NIRV	Genesis	50	17	He said , ‘ Here ’ s what you must say to Joseph . Tell him , “ I ’ m asking you to forgive your brothers . Forgive the terrible things they did to you . Forgive them for treating you so badly. ” ’ Now then , please forgive our sins . We serve the God of your father. ” When their message came to Joseph , he wept .
NIRV	Genesis	50	18	Then his brothers came and threw themselves down in front of him . “ We are your slaves , ” they said .
NIRV	Genesis	50	19	But Joseph said to them , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Do you think I ’ m God ?
NIRV	Genesis	50	20	You planned to harm me . But God planned it for good . He planned to do what is now being done . He wanted to save many lives .
NIRV	Genesis	50	21	So then , don ’ t be afraid . I ’ ll provide for you and your children. ” He calmed their fears . And he spoke in a kind way to them . Joseph Dies
NIRV	Genesis	50	22	Joseph stayed in Egypt , along with all his father ’ s family . He lived

NIRV	Genesis	50	23	He lived long enough to see Ephraim ’ s children and grandchildren . When the children of Makir were born , they were placed on Joseph ’ s knees and counted as his own children . Makir was the son of Manasseh .

NIRV	Exodus	1	1	Here are the names of Israel ’ s children who went to Egypt with Jacob . Each one went with his family .
NIRV	Exodus	1	2	Jacob ’ s sons were Reuben , Simeon , Levi , Judah ,
NIRV	Exodus	1	3	Issachar , Zebulun , Benjamin ,
NIRV	Exodus	1	4	Dan , Naphtali , Gad and Asher .
NIRV	Exodus	1	5	The total number of Jacob ’ s children and grandchildren was
NIRV	Exodus	1	70	. Joseph was already in Egypt .
NIRV	Exodus	1	6	Joseph and all his brothers died . So did all their children .
NIRV	Exodus	1	7	The people of Israel had many children . The number of them greatly increased . There were so many of them that they filled the land .
NIRV	Exodus	1	8	Then a new king came to power in Egypt . Joseph didn ’ t mean anything to him .
NIRV	Exodus	1	9	“ Look , ” he said to his people . “ The Israelites are far too many for us .
NIRV	Exodus	1	10	Come . We must deal with them carefully . If we don ’ t , there will be even more of them . Then if war breaks out , they ’ ll join our enemies . They ’ ll fight against us and leave the country. ”
NIRV	Exodus	1	11	So the Egyptians put slave drivers over the people of Israel . The slave drivers treated them badly and made them work hard . The Israelites built the cities of Pithom and Rameses so Pharaoh could store things there .
NIRV	Exodus	1	12	But the worse the slave drivers treated the Israelites , the more Israelites there were . So the Egyptians became afraid of them .
NIRV	Exodus	1	13	They made them work hard . They didn ’ t show them any pity .
NIRV	Exodus	1	14	The people suffered because of their hard labor . The slave drivers forced them to work with bricks and mud . And they made them do all kinds of work in the fields . The Egyptians didn ’ t show them any pity at all . They made them work very hard .
NIRV	Exodus	1	15	There were two Hebrew women named Shiphrah and Puah . They helped other women having babies . The king of Egypt spoke to them . He said ,
NIRV	Exodus	1	16	“ You are the ones who help the other Hebrew women . Watch them when they get into a sitting position to have their babies . Kill the boys . Let the girls live. ”
NIRV	Exodus	1	17	But Shiphrah and Puah had respect for God . They didn ’ t do what the king of Egypt had told them to do . They let the boys live .
NIRV	Exodus	1	18	Then the king of Egypt sent for the women . He asked them , “ Why have you done this ? Why have you let the boys live ? ”
NIRV	Exodus	1	19	The women answered Pharaoh , “ Hebrew women are not like the women of Egypt . They are strong . They have their babies before we get there. ”
NIRV	Exodus	1	20	So God was kind to Shiphrah and Puah . And the number of Israelites became even greater .
NIRV	Exodus	1	21	Shiphrah and Puah had respect for God . So he gave them families of their own .
NIRV	Exodus	1	22	Then Pharaoh gave an order to all his people . He said , “ You must throw every Hebrew baby boy into the Nile River . But let every Hebrew baby girl live. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Exodus	2	2	She became pregnant and had a son by her husband . She saw that her baby was a fine child . And she hid him for three months .
NIRV	Exodus	2	3	After that , she couldn ’ t hide him any longer . So she got a basket made out of the stems of tall grass . She coated the basket with tar . She placed the child in the basket . Then she put it in the tall grass that grew along the bank of the Nile River .
NIRV	Exodus	2	4	The child ’ s sister wasn ’ t very far away . She wanted to see what would happen to him .
NIRV	Exodus	2	5	Pharaoh ’ s daughter went down to the Nile River to take a bath . Her attendants were walking along the river bank . She saw the basket in the tall grass . So she sent her female slave to get it .
NIRV	Exodus	2	6	When she opened it , Pharaoh ’ s daughter saw the baby . He was crying . She felt sorry for him . “ This is one of the Hebrew babies , ” she said .
NIRV	Exodus	2	7	Then his sister spoke to Pharaoh ’ s daughter . She asked , “ Do you want me to go and get one of the Hebrew women ? She could breast-feed the baby for you. ”
NIRV	Exodus	2	8	“ Yes . Go , ” she answered . So the girl went and got the baby ’ s mother .
NIRV	Exodus	2	9	Pharaoh ’ s daughter said to her , “ Take this baby and feed him for me . I ’ ll pay you. ” So the woman took the baby and fed him .
NIRV	Exodus	2	10	When the child grew older , she took him to Pharaoh ’ s daughter . And he became her son . She named him Moses . She said , “ I pulled him out of the water. ” Moses Escapes to Midian
NIRV	Exodus	2	11	Moses grew up . One day , he went out to where his own people were . He watched them while they were hard at work . He saw an Egyptian hitting a Hebrew man . The man was one of Moses ’ own people .
NIRV	Exodus	2	12	Moses looked around and didn ’ t see anyone . So he killed the Egyptian . Then he hid his body in the sand .
NIRV	Exodus	2	13	The next day Moses went out again . He saw two Hebrew men fighting . He asked the one who had started the fight a question . He said , “ Why are you hitting another Hebrew man ? ”
NIRV	Exodus	2	14	The man said , “ Who made you ruler and judge over us ? Are you thinking about killing me as you killed the Egyptian ? ” Then Moses became afraid . He thought , “ People must have heard about what I did. ”
NIRV	Exodus	2	15	When Pharaoh heard about what had happened , he tried to kill Moses . But Moses escaped from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian . There he sat down by a well .
NIRV	Exodus	2	16	A priest of Midian had seven daughters . They came to fill the stone tubs with water . They wanted to give water to their father ’ s flock .
NIRV	Exodus	2	17	Some shepherds came along and chased the girls away . But Moses got up and helped them . Then he gave water to their flock .
NIRV	Exodus	2	18	The girls returned to their father Reuel . He asked them , “ Why have you returned so early today ? ”
NIRV	Exodus	2	19	They answered , “ An Egyptian saved us from the shepherds . He even got water for us and gave it to the flock. ”
NIRV	Exodus	2	20	“ Where is he ? ” Reuel asked his daughters . “ Why did you leave him ? Invite him to have something to eat. ”
NIRV	Exodus	2	21	Moses agreed to stay with the man . And the man gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses to be his wife .
NIRV	Exodus	2	22	Zipporah had a son by him . Moses named him Gershom . That ’ s because Moses said , “ I ’ m an outsider in a strange land. ”
NIRV	Exodus	2	23	After a long time , the king of Egypt died . The people of Israel groaned because they were slaves . They also cried out to God . Their cry for help went up to him .
NIRV	Exodus	2	24	God heard their groans . He remembered his covenant with Abraham , Isaac and Jacob .

NIRV	Exodus	3	4	The Lord saw that Moses had gone over to look . So God spoke to him from inside the bush . He called out , “ Moses ! Moses ! ” “ Here I am , ” Moses said .
NIRV	Exodus	3	5	“ Do not come any closer , ” God said . “ Take off your sandals . The place you are standing on is holy ground. ”
NIRV	Exodus	3	6	He continued , “ I am the God of your father . I am the God of Abraham . I am the God of Isaac . And I am the God of Jacob. ” When Moses heard that , he turned his face away . He was afraid to look at God .
NIRV	Exodus	3	7	The Lord said , “ I have seen how my people are suffering in Egypt . I have heard them cry out because of their slave drivers . I am concerned about their suffering .
NIRV	Exodus	3	8	So I have come down to save them from the Egyptians . I will bring them up out of that land . I will bring them into a good land . It has a lot of room . It is a land that has plenty of milk and honey . The Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites and Jebusites live there .
NIRV	Exodus	3	9	And now Israel ’ s cry for help has reached me . I have seen how badly the Egyptians are treating them .
NIRV	Exodus	3	10	So now , go . I am sending you to Pharaoh . I want you to bring the Israelites out of Egypt . They are my people. ”
NIRV	Exodus	3	11	But Moses spoke to God . “ Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh ? ” he said . “ Who am I that I should bring the Israelites out of Egypt ? ”
NIRV	Exodus	3	12	God said , “ I will be with you . I will give you a sign . It will prove that I have sent you . When you have brought the people out of Egypt , all of you will worship me on this mountain. ”
NIRV	Exodus	3	13	Moses said to God , “ Suppose I go to the people of Israel . Suppose I say to them , ‘ The God of your fathers has sent me to you. ’ And suppose they ask me , ‘ What is his name ? ’ Then what should I tell them ? ”
NIRV	Exodus	3	14	God said to Moses , “ I am who I am . Here is what you must say to the Israelites . Tell them , ‘ I am has sent me to you. ’ ”
NIRV	Exodus	3	15	God also said to Moses , “ Say to the Israelites , ‘ The Lord is the God of your fathers . He has sent me to you . He is the God of Abraham . He is the God of Isaac . And he is the God of Jacob. ’ My name will always be The Lord . Call me this name for all time to come .
NIRV	Exodus	3	16	“ Go . Gather the elders of Israel together . Say to them , ‘ The Lord , the God of your fathers , appeared to me . He is the God of Abraham , Isaac and Jacob . God said , “ I have watched over you . I have seen what the Egyptians have done to you .
NIRV	Exodus	3	17	I have promised to bring you up out of Egypt where you are suffering . I will bring you into the land of the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites and Jebusites . It is a land that has plenty of milk and honey. ” ’
NIRV	Exodus	3	18	“ The elders of Israel will listen to you . Then you and the elders must go to the king of Egypt . You must say to him , ‘ The Lord has met with us . He is the God of the Hebrews . Let us take a journey that lasts about three days . We want to go into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God. ’
NIRV	Exodus	3	19	But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you and your people go . Only a mighty hand could make him do that .
NIRV	Exodus	3	20	So I will reach out my hand . I will strike the Egyptians with all the amazing things I will do . After that , their king will let you go .
NIRV	Exodus	3	21	“ I will cause the Egyptians to treat you in a kind way . Then when you leave , you will not go with your hands empty .
NIRV	Exodus	3	22	Every woman should ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for things made out of silver and gold . Ask them for clothes too . Put them on your children . In that way , you will take the wealth of Egypt along with you. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Exodus	4	4	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Reach your hand out . Take the snake by the tail. ” So he reached out and grabbed the snake . It turned back into a walking stick in his hand .
NIRV	Exodus	4	2	The Lord said to him , “ What do you have in your hand ? ” “ A walking stick , ” he said .
NIRV	Exodus	4	3	The Lord said , “ Throw it on the ground. ” So Moses threw it on the ground . It turned into a snake . He ran away from it .
NIRV	Exodus	4	5	The Lord said , “ When they see this sign , they will believe that I appeared to you . I am the Lord , the God of their fathers . I am the God of Abraham . I am the God of Isaac . And I am the God of Jacob. ”
NIRV	Exodus	4	6	Then the Lord said , “ Put your hand inside your coat. ” So Moses put his hand inside his coat . When he took it out , the skin had become as white as snow . His hand was covered with a skin disease .
NIRV	Exodus	4	7	“ Now put it back into your coat , ” the Lord said . So Moses put his hand back into his coat . When he took it out , the skin was healthy again . His hand was like the rest of his skin .
NIRV	Exodus	4	8	Then the Lord said , “ Suppose they do not believe you or pay attention to the first sign . Then maybe they will believe the second one .
NIRV	Exodus	4	9	But suppose they do not believe either sign . Suppose they will not listen to you . Then get some water from the Nile River . Pour it on the dry ground . The water you take from the river will turn into blood on the ground. ”
NIRV	Exodus	4	10	Moses spoke to the Lord . He said , “ Lord , I ’ ve never been a good speaker . And I haven ’ t gotten any better since you spoke to me . I don ’ t speak very well at all. ”
NIRV	Exodus	4	11	The Lord said to him , “ Who makes human beings able to talk ? Who makes them unable to hear or speak ? Who makes them able to see ? Who makes them blind ? It is I , the Lord .
NIRV	Exodus	4	12	Now go . I will help you speak . I will teach you what to say. ”
NIRV	Exodus	4	13	But Moses said , “ Lord , please send someone else to do it. ”
NIRV	Exodus	4	14	Then the Lord became very angry with Moses . He said , “ What about your brother , Aaron the Levite ? I know he can speak well . He is already on his way to meet you . He will be glad to see you .
NIRV	Exodus	4	15	Speak to him . Tell him what to say . I will help both of you speak . I will teach you what to do .
NIRV	Exodus	4	16	He will speak to the people for you . He will be like your mouth . And you will be like God to him .
NIRV	Exodus	4	17	But take this walking stick in your hand . You will be able to do signs with it. ” Moses Returns to Egypt
NIRV	Exodus	4	18	Then Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro . He said to him , “ Let me return to my own people in Egypt . I want to see if any of them are still alive. ” Jethro said , “ Go . I hope everything goes well with you. ”
NIRV	Exodus	4	19	The Lord had said to Moses in Midian , “ Go back to Egypt . All those who wanted to kill you are dead. ”
NIRV	Exodus	4	20	So Moses got his wife and sons . He put them on a donkey . Together they started back to Egypt . And he took the walking stick in his hand . It was the stick God would use in a powerful way .
NIRV	Exodus	4	21	The Lord spoke to Moses . He said , “ When you return to Egypt , do all the amazing things I have given you the power to do . Do them in the sight of Pharaoh . But I will make him stubborn . He will not let the people go .
NIRV	Exodus	4	22	Then say to Pharaoh , ‘ The Lord says , “ Israel is like an oldest son to me .
NIRV	Exodus	4	23	I told you , ‘ Let my son go . Then he will be able to worship me. ’ But you refused to let him go . So I will kill your oldest son. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Exodus	4	24	On the way to Egypt , Moses stopped for the night . There the Lord met him and was about to kill him .
NIRV	Exodus	4	25	But Zipporah got a knife made out of flint . She circumcised her son with it . Then she touched Moses ’ feet with the skin she had cut off . “ Surely , you are a husband who has forced me to spill my son ’ s blood , ” she said .
NIRV	Exodus	4	26	So the Lord didn ’ t kill Moses . When she said “ husband who has forced me to spill my son ’ s blood , ” she was talking about circumcision .
NIRV	Exodus	4	27	The Lord said to Aaron , “ Go into the desert to see Moses. ” So Aaron greeted Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him .
NIRV	Exodus	4	28	Then Moses told Aaron everything the Lord had sent him to say . Moses also told him about all the signs the Lord had commanded him to do .
NIRV	Exodus	4	29	Moses and Aaron gathered all the elders of Israel together .
NIRV	Exodus	4	30	Aaron told them everything the Lord had said to Moses . He also performed the signs in the sight of the people .

NIRV	Exodus	5	5	Pharaoh continued , “ There are large numbers of your people in the land . But you are stopping them from working. ”
NIRV	Exodus	5	2	Pharaoh said , “ Who is the Lord ? Why should I obey him ? Why should I let Israel go ? I don ’ t even know the Lord . And I won ’ t let Israel go. ”
NIRV	Exodus	5	3	Then Moses and Aaron said , “ The God of the Hebrews has met with us . Now let us take a journey that lasts about three days . We want to go into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God . If we don ’ t , he might strike us with plagues . Or he might let us be killed by swords. ”
NIRV	Exodus	5	4	But the king of Egypt said , “ Moses and Aaron , why are you taking the people away from their work ? Get back to work ! ”
NIRV	Exodus	5	6	That same day Pharaoh gave orders to the slave drivers and the overseers in charge of the people .
NIRV	Exodus	5	7	He said , “ Don ’ t give the people any more straw to make bricks . Let them go and get their own straw .
NIRV	Exodus	5	8	But require them to make the same number of bricks as before . Don ’ t lower the number they have to make . They are lazy . That ’ s why they are crying out , ‘ Let us go . We want to offer sacrifices to our God. ’
NIRV	Exodus	5	9	Make them work harder . Then they will be too busy to pay attention to lies. ”
NIRV	Exodus	5	10	The slave drivers and the overseers left . They said to the people , “ Pharaoh says , ‘ I won ’ t give you any more straw .
NIRV	Exodus	5	11	Go and get your own straw anywhere you can find it . But you still have to make the same number of bricks. ’ ”
NIRV	Exodus	5	12	So the people scattered all over Egypt . They went to gather any pieces of straw left in the fields .
NIRV	Exodus	5	13	Pharaoh ’ s slave drivers kept making the people work hard . They said , “ Finish the work you are required to do each day . Make the same number of bricks you made when you had straw. ”
NIRV	Exodus	5	14	The slave drivers whipped the Israelite overseers they had appointed . The slave drivers asked , “ Why haven ’ t you made the same number of bricks yesterday or today , just as before ? ”
NIRV	Exodus	5	15	Then the Israelite overseers appealed to Pharaoh . They asked , “ Why have you treated us like this ?
NIRV	Exodus	5	16	You didn ’ t give us any straw . But you told us , ‘ Make bricks ! ’ We are being whipped . But it ’ s the fault of your own people. ”
NIRV	Exodus	5	17	Pharaoh said , “ You are lazy ! That ’ s why you keep saying , ‘ Let us go . We want to offer sacrifices to the Lord. ’
NIRV	Exodus	5	18	Now get to work . We won ’ t give you any straw . But you still have to make the same number of bricks. ”
NIRV	Exodus	5	19	The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble . They knew it when they were told , “ Don ’ t reduce the number of bricks you are required to make each day. ”
NIRV	Exodus	5	20	When they left Pharaoh , they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them .
NIRV	Exodus	5	21	They said to Moses and Aaron , “ We want the Lord to look at what you have done ! We want him to judge you for it ! We are like a very bad smell to Pharaoh and his officials . You have given them an excuse to kill us with their swords. ” The Lord Promises to Save the Israelites
NIRV	Exodus	5	22	Moses returned to talk to the Lord . He said to him , “ Why , Lord ? Why have you brought trouble on these people ? Is this why you sent me ?

NIRV	Exodus	7	9	He said , “ Pharaoh will say to you , ‘ Do a miracle. ’ When he does , speak to Aaron . Tell him , ‘ Take your walking stick and throw it down in front of Pharaoh. ’ It will turn into a snake. ”
NIRV	Exodus	7	10	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh . They did exactly as the Lord had commanded them . Aaron threw the stick down in front of Pharaoh and his officials . It turned into a snake .
NIRV	Exodus	7	11	Then Pharaoh sent for wise men and people who do evil magic . By doing their magic tricks , the Egyptian magicians did the same things Aaron had done .
NIRV	Exodus	7	12	Each one threw down his walking stick . Each stick turned into a snake . But Aaron ’ s walking stick swallowed theirs up .

NIRV	Exodus	8	8	Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron . He said to them , “ Pray to the Lord to take the frogs away from me and my people . Then I ’ ll let your people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord. ”
NIRV	Exodus	8	1	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ Go to Pharaoh . Tell him , ‘ The Lord says , “ Let my people go . Then they will be able to worship me .
NIRV	Exodus	8	2	If you refuse to let them go , I will send a plague of frogs on your whole country .
NIRV	Exodus	8	3	The Nile River will be full of frogs . They will come up into your palace . You will have frogs in your bedroom and on your bed . They will be in the homes of your officials and your people . They will be in your ovens and in the bowls for kneading your bread .
NIRV	Exodus	8	4	The frogs will be on you , your people and all your officials. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Exodus	8	5	Then the Lord spoke to Moses . He said , “ Tell Aaron , ‘ Reach out your hand . Hold your walking stick over the streams , canals and ponds . Make frogs come up on the land of Egypt. ’ ”
NIRV	Exodus	8	6	So Aaron reached out his hand over the waters of Egypt . The frogs came up and covered the land .
NIRV	Exodus	8	7	But the magicians did the same things by doing their magic tricks . They also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt .
NIRV	Exodus	8	9	Moses said to Pharaoh , “ You can have the honor of setting the time for me to pray . I will pray for you , your officials and your people . I ’ ll pray that the frogs will leave you and your homes . The only frogs left will be the ones in the Nile River. ”
NIRV	Exodus	8	10	“ Tomorrow , ” Pharaoh said . Moses replied , “ It will happen just as you say . Then you will know that there is no one like the Lord our God .
NIRV	Exodus	8	11	The frogs will leave you and your houses . They will leave your officials and your people . The frogs will remain only in the Nile River. ”

NIRV	Exodus	8	16	Then the Lord spoke to Moses . He said , “ Tell Aaron , ‘ Reach out your walking stick . Strike the dust on the ground with it. ’ Then all over the land of Egypt the dust will turn into gnats. ”
NIRV	Exodus	8	17	So they did it . Aaron reached out the stick that was in his hand . He struck the dust on the ground with it . The dust all over the land of Egypt turned into gnats . They landed on people and animals alike .
NIRV	Exodus	8	18	The magicians tried to produce gnats by doing their magic tricks . But they couldn ’ t . The gnats stayed on people and animals everywhere .
NIRV	Exodus	8	19	So the magicians said to Pharaoh , “ God ’ s powerful finger has done this. ” But Pharaoh remained stubborn . He wouldn ’ t listen , just as the Lord had said . The Plague of Flies
NIRV	Exodus	8	20	Then the Lord spoke to Moses . He said , “ Get up early in the morning . Talk to Pharaoh as he goes down to the Nile River . Say to him , ‘ The Lord says , “ Let my people go . Then they will be able to worship me .
NIRV	Exodus	8	21	If you do not let my people go , I will send large numbers of flies . I will send them on you and your officials . I will send them on your people and into your homes . The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies . Even the ground will be covered with them .

NIRV	Exodus	8	24	So the Lord did it . Huge numbers of flies poured into Pharaoh ’ s palace . They came into the homes of his officials . All over Egypt the flies destroyed the land .
NIRV	Exodus	8	25	Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron . He said to them , “ Go . Offer sacrifices to your God here in the land. ”
NIRV	Exodus	8	26	But Moses said , “ That wouldn ’ t be right . The sacrifices we offer to the Lord our God wouldn ’ t be accepted by the Egyptians because of their beliefs . For that reason , they would throw stones at us and try to kill us .
NIRV	Exodus	8	27	We have to take a journey that lasts about three days . We want to go into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God , just as he commands us. ”
NIRV	Exodus	8	28	Pharaoh said , “ I will let you and your people go to offer sacrifices . You can offer them to the Lord your God in the desert . But you must not go very far . Now pray for me. ”
NIRV	Exodus	8	29	Moses replied , “ As soon as I leave you , I will pray to the Lord . Tomorrow the flies will leave you . They will also leave your officials and your people . Just be sure you don ’ t try to trick us again . Let the people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord. ”

NIRV	Exodus	9	10	So Moses and Aaron took ashes from a furnace and stood in front of Pharaoh . Moses tossed them into the air . Then boils broke out on people and animals alike .
NIRV	Exodus	9	11	The bodies of all the Egyptians were covered with boils . The magicians couldn ’ t stand in front of Moses because of the boils that were all over them .
NIRV	Exodus	9	12	But the Lord made Pharaoh stubborn . Pharaoh wouldn ’ t listen to Moses and Aaron , just as the Lord had said to Moses . The Plague of Hail
NIRV	Exodus	9	13	Then the Lord spoke to Moses . He said , “ Get up early in the morning . Go to Pharaoh and say to him , ‘ The Lord , the God of the Hebrews , says , “ Let my people go . Then they will be able to worship me .
NIRV	Exodus	9	14	If you do not let them go , I will send the full force of my plagues against you this time . They will strike your officials and your people . Then you will know that there is no one like me in the whole earth .
NIRV	Exodus	9	15	By now I could have reached out my hand . I could have struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth .
NIRV	Exodus	9	16	But I had a special reason for making you king . I decided to show you my power . I wanted my name to become known everywhere on earth .
NIRV	Exodus	9	17	But you are still against my people . You will not let them go .
NIRV	Exodus	9	18	So at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm ever to fall on Egypt in its entire history .
NIRV	Exodus	9	19	Give an order now to bring your livestock inside to a safe place . Bring in everything that is outside . The hail will fall on all the people and animals that are left outside . They will die. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Exodus	9	20	The officials of Pharaoh who had respect for what the Lord had said obeyed him . They hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside .
NIRV	Exodus	9	21	But others didn ’ t pay attention to what the Lord had said . They left their slaves and livestock outside .
NIRV	Exodus	9	22	Then the Lord spoke to Moses . He said , “ Reach out your hand toward the sky . Then hail will fall all over Egypt . It will beat down on people and animals alike . It will strike everything growing in the fields of Egypt. ”
NIRV	Exodus	9	23	Moses reached out his walking stick toward the sky . Then the Lord sent thunder and hail . Lightning flashed down to the ground . The Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt .
NIRV	Exodus	9	24	Hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth . It was the worst storm in Egypt ’ s entire history .
NIRV	Exodus	9	25	Hail struck everything in the fields all over Egypt . It fell on people and animals alike . It beat down everything growing in the fields . It tore all the leaves off the trees .
NIRV	Exodus	9	26	The only place it didn ’ t hail was in the area of Goshen . That ’ s where the people of Israel were .
NIRV	Exodus	9	27	Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron . “ This time I ’ ve sinned , ” he said to them . “ The Lord has done what is right . I and my people have done what is wrong .
NIRV	Exodus	9	28	Pray to the Lord , because we ’ ve had enough thunder and hail . I ’ ll let you and your people go . You don ’ t have to stay here any longer. ”
NIRV	Exodus	9	29	Moses replied , “ When I ’ ve left the city , I ’ ll lift up my hands and pray to the Lord . The thunder will stop . There won ’ t be any more hail . Then you will know that the earth belongs to the Lord .
NIRV	Exodus	9	30	But I know that you and your officials still don ’ t have any respect for the Lord God. ”
NIRV	Exodus	9	31	The barley was ripe . The flax was in bloom . So they were both destroyed .
NIRV	Exodus	9	32	But the wheat and spelt weren ’ t destroyed . That ’ s because they ripen later .
NIRV	Exodus	9	33	Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city . Moses lifted up his hands and prayed to the Lord . The thunder and hail stopped . The rain didn ’ t pour down on the land any longer .
NIRV	Exodus	9	34	Pharaoh saw that the rain , hail and thunder had stopped . So he sinned again . He and his officials became stubborn .
NIRV	Exodus	9	35	So Pharaoh was stubborn . He wouldn ’ t let the people of Israel go , just as the Lord had said through Moses . Copyright ©

NIRV	Exodus	10	10	Pharaoh said , “ Suppose I ever let you go , along with your women and children . Then the Lord really will be with all of you ! Clearly you are planning to do something bad .
NIRV	Exodus	10	2	Then you will be able to tell your children and grandchildren how hard I was on the Egyptians . You can tell them I performed my signs among the people of Egypt . And all of you will know that I am the Lord. ”
NIRV	Exodus	10	3	So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh . They said to him , “ The Lord , the God of the Hebrews , says , ‘ How long will you refuse to obey me ? Let my people go . Then they will be able to worship me .
NIRV	Exodus	10	4	If you refuse to let them go , I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow .
NIRV	Exodus	10	5	They will cover the ground so that it can ’ t be seen . They will eat what little you have left after the hail . That includes every tree growing in your fields .
NIRV	Exodus	10	6	They will fill your houses . They will be in the homes of all your officials and your people . Your parents and your people before them have never seen anything like it as long as they have lived here. ’ ” Then Moses turned around and left Pharaoh .
NIRV	Exodus	10	7	Pharaoh ’ s officials said to him , “ How long will this man be a trap for us ? Let the people go . Then they ’ ll be able to worship the Lord their God . After everything that ’ s happened , don ’ t you realize that Egypt is destroyed ? ”
NIRV	Exodus	10	8	Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh . “ Go . Worship the Lord your God , ” he said . “ But tell me who will be going. ”
NIRV	Exodus	10	9	Moses answered , “ We ’ ll go with our young people and old people . We ’ ll go with our sons and daughters . We ’ ll take our flocks and herds . We are supposed to hold a feast to honor the Lord. ”
NIRV	Exodus	10	11	No ! I ’ ll only allow the men to go and worship the Lord . After all , that ’ s what you have been asking for. ” Then Pharaoh drove Moses and Aaron out of his sight .
NIRV	Exodus	10	12	The Lord said to Moses , “ Reach out your hand over Egypt so that locusts cover the land . They will eat up everything growing in the fields . They will eat up everything left by the hail. ”
NIRV	Exodus	10	13	So Moses reached out his walking stick over Egypt . Then the Lord made an east wind blow across the land . It blew all that day and all that night . By morning the wind had brought the locusts .
NIRV	Exodus	10	14	Large numbers of them came down in every part of Egypt . There had never been a plague of locusts like it before . And there will never be one like it again .
NIRV	Exodus	10	15	The locusts covered the ground until it was black . They ate up everything left after the hail . They ate up everything growing in the fields . They ate up the fruit on the trees . There was nothing green left on any tree or plant in the whole land of Egypt .
NIRV	Exodus	10	16	Pharaoh quickly sent for Moses and Aaron . He said , “ I have sinned against the Lord your God . I ’ ve also sinned against you .
NIRV	Exodus	10	17	Now forgive my sin one more time . Pray to the Lord your God to take this deadly plague away from me. ”
NIRV	Exodus	10	18	After Moses left Pharaoh , he prayed to the Lord .
NIRV	Exodus	10	19	The Lord changed the wind to a very strong west wind . It picked up the locusts . It blew them into the Red Sea . Not even one locust was left anywhere in Egypt .
NIRV	Exodus	10	20	But the Lord made Pharaoh stubborn . So Pharaoh wouldn ’ t let the people of Israel go . The Plague of Darkness
NIRV	Exodus	10	21	The Lord spoke to Moses . He said , “ Reach out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt . It will be so dark that people can feel it. ”
NIRV	Exodus	10	22	So Moses reached out his hand toward the sky . Then complete darkness covered Egypt for three days .
NIRV	Exodus	10	23	No one could see anyone else or go anywhere for three days . But all the people of Israel had light where they lived .
NIRV	Exodus	10	24	Then Pharaoh sent for Moses . He said to him , “ Go . Worship the Lord . Even your women and children can go with you . Just leave your flocks and herds behind. ”
NIRV	Exodus	10	25	But Moses said , “ You must allow us to take our animals . We need to offer them as sacrifices and burnt offerings to the Lord our God .
NIRV	Exodus	10	26	Our livestock must also go with us . We have to use some of them to worship the Lord our God . We can ’ t leave even one animal behind . Until we get there , we won ’ t know what we are supposed to use to worship the Lord. ”
NIRV	Exodus	10	27	But the Lord made Pharaoh stubborn . So he wouldn ’ t let the people go .
NIRV	Exodus	10	28	Pharaoh said to Moses , “ Get out of my sight ! Make sure you don ’ t come to see me again ! If you do , you will die. ”
NIRV	Exodus	10	29	“ I ’ ll do just as you say , ” Moses replied . “ I will never come to see you again. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Exodus	11	6	There will be loud crying all over Egypt . It will be worse than it ’ s ever been before . And nothing like it will ever be heard again .

NIRV	Exodus	12	27	Tell them , ‘ It ’ s the Passover sacrifice to honor the Lord . He passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt . He spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians. ’ ” Then the Israelites bowed down and worshiped .
NIRV	Exodus	12	28	They did just what the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron .
NIRV	Exodus	12	29	At midnight the Lord struck down every oldest son in Egypt . He killed the oldest son of Pharaoh , who sat on the throne . He killed all the oldest sons of prisoners . He also killed all the male animals born first to their mothers among the livestock .

NIRV	Exodus	12	33	The Egyptians begged the people of Israel to hurry up and leave the country . “ If you don ’ t , ” they said , “ we ’ ll all die ! ”

NIRV	Exodus	12	38	So did many other people . The Israelites also took large flocks and herds with them .
NIRV	Exodus	12	39	The Israelites brought dough from Egypt . With it they baked loaves of bread without yeast . The dough didn ’ t have any yeast in it . That ’ s because the people had been driven out of Egypt before they had time to prepare their food .
NIRV	Exodus	12	40	The Israelites lived in Egypt for
NIRV	Exodus	12	430	years , to the exact day .
NIRV	Exodus	12	41	Then all the Lord ’ s people marched out of Egypt like an army . That happened at the end of the

NIRV	Exodus	12	45	But a hired worker or someone who lives with you for a short time is not allowed to eat it .
NIRV	Exodus	12	46	“ It must be eaten inside the house . Do not take any of the meat outside . Do not break any of the bones .
NIRV	Exodus	12	47	The whole community of Israel must celebrate the Passover .

NIRV	Exodus	13	16	This holy day will be like a mark on your hand . It will be like a sign on your forehead . It will remind you that the Lord used his mighty hand to bring us out of Egypt. ” Israel Goes Through the Red Sea
NIRV	Exodus	13	17	Pharaoh let the people go . The shortest road from Goshen to Canaan went through the Philistine country . But God didn ’ t lead them that way . God said , “ If they have to go into battle , they might change their minds . They might return to Egypt. ”
NIRV	Exodus	13	18	So God led the people toward the Red Sea by taking them on a road through the desert . The Israelites were ready for battle when they went up out of Egypt .
NIRV	Exodus	13	19	Moses took the bones of Joseph along with him . Joseph had made the Israelites give their word to do this . He had said , “ God will surely come to help you . When he does , you must carry my bones up from this place with you. ” ( Genesis 50:25 )

NIRV	Exodus	14	2	He said , “ Tell the people of Israel to turn back . Have them camp near Pi Hahiroth between Migdol and the Red Sea . They must camp by the sea , right across from Baal Zephon .
NIRV	Exodus	14	3	Pharaoh will think , ‘ The Israelites are wandering around the land . They don ’ t know which way to go . The desert is all around them. ’
NIRV	Exodus	14	4	I will make Pharaoh stubborn . He will chase them . But I will gain glory for myself because of what will happen to Pharaoh and his whole army . And the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord. ” So the Israelites camped by the Red Sea .
NIRV	Exodus	14	5	The king of Egypt was told that the people had escaped . Then Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them . They said , “ What have we done ? We ’ ve let the people of Israel go ! We ’ ve lost our slaves and all the work they used to do for us ! ”
NIRV	Exodus	14	6	So he had his chariot made ready . He took his army with him .
NIRV	Exodus	14	7	He took
NIRV	Exodus	14	600	of the best chariots in Egypt . He also took along all the other chariots . Officers were in charge of all of them .
NIRV	Exodus	14	8	The Lord made Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , stubborn . So he chased the Israelites as they were marching out boldly .
NIRV	Exodus	14	9	The Egyptians went after the Israelites . All Pharaoh ’ s horses and chariots and horsemen and troops chased them . They caught up with the Israelites as they camped by the sea . The Israelites were near Pi Hahiroth , across from Baal Zephon .
NIRV	Exodus	14	10	As Pharaoh approached , the Israelites looked back . There were the Egyptians marching after them ! The Israelites were terrified . They cried out to the Lord .
NIRV	Exodus	14	11	They said to Moses , “ Why did you bring us to the desert to die ? Weren ’ t there any graves in Egypt ? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt ?
NIRV	Exodus	14	12	We told you in Egypt , ‘ Leave us alone . Let us serve the Egyptians. ’ It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die here in the desert ! ”
NIRV	Exodus	14	13	Moses answered the people . He said , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Stand firm . You will see how the Lord will save you today . Do you see those Egyptians ? You will never see them again .
NIRV	Exodus	14	15	Then the Lord spoke to Moses . He said , “ Why are you crying out to me ? Tell the people of Israel to move on .
NIRV	Exodus	14	16	Hold out your walking stick . Reach out your hand over the Red Sea to divide the water . Then the people can go through the sea on dry ground .
NIRV	Exodus	14	17	I will make the Egyptians stubborn . They will go in after the Israelites . I will gain glory for myself because of what will happen to Pharaoh , his army , chariots and horsemen .
NIRV	Exodus	14	18	The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord . I will gain glory because of what will happen to Pharaoh , his chariots and his horsemen. ”
NIRV	Exodus	14	19	The angel of God had been traveling in front of Israel ’ s army . Now he moved back and went behind them . The pillar of cloud also moved away from in front of them . Now it stood behind them .
NIRV	Exodus	14	20	It came between the armies of Egypt and Israel . All through the night the cloud brought darkness to one side and light to the other . Neither army went near the other all night long .
NIRV	Exodus	14	21	Then Moses reached out his hand over the Red Sea . All that night the Lord pushed the sea back with a strong east wind . He turned the sea into dry land . The waters were divided .
NIRV	Exodus	14	22	The people of Israel went through the sea on dry ground . There was a wall of water on their right side and on their left .
NIRV	Exodus	14	23	The Egyptians chased them . All Pharaoh ’ s horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea .
NIRV	Exodus	14	24	Near the end of the night the Lord looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud . He saw the Egyptian army and threw it into a panic .
NIRV	Exodus	14	25	He jammed the wheels of their chariots . That made the chariots hard to drive . The Egyptians said , “ Let ’ s get away from the Israelites ! The Lord is fighting for Israel against Egypt. ”
NIRV	Exodus	14	26	Then the Lord spoke to Moses . He said , “ Reach out your hand over the sea . The waters will flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen. ”
NIRV	Exodus	14	27	So Moses reached out his hand over the sea . At sunrise the sea went back to its place . The Egyptians tried to run away from the sea . But the Lord swept them into it .
NIRV	Exodus	14	28	The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen . It covered the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the people of Israel into the sea . Not one of the Egyptians was left .

NIRV	Exodus	16	16	Here is what the Lord has commanded . He has said , ‘ Everyone should gather as much as they need . Take three pounds for each person who lives in your tent. ’ ”
NIRV	Exodus	16	2	In the desert the whole community told Moses and Aaron they weren ’ t happy with them .
NIRV	Exodus	16	3	The Israelites said to them , “ We wish the Lord had put us to death in Egypt . There we sat around pots of meat . We ate all the food we wanted . But you have brought us out into this desert . You must want this entire community to die of hunger. ”
NIRV	Exodus	16	4	Then the Lord spoke to Moses . He said , “ I will rain down bread from heaven for you . The people must go out each day . Have them gather enough bread for that day . Here is how I will test them . I will see if they will follow my directions .
NIRV	Exodus	16	5	On the sixth day they must prepare what they bring in . On that day they must gather twice as much as on the other days. ”
NIRV	Exodus	16	6	So Moses and Aaron spoke to all the people of Israel . They said , “ In the evening you will know that the Lord brought you out of Egypt .
NIRV	Exodus	16	7	And in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord . He has heard you say you aren ’ t happy with him . Who are we ? Why are you telling us you aren ’ t happy with us ? ”
NIRV	Exodus	16	8	Moses also said , “ You will know that the Lord has heard you speak against him . He will give you meat to eat in the evening . He ’ ll give you all the bread you want in the morning . But who are we ? You aren ’ t speaking against us . You are speaking against the Lord. ”
NIRV	Exodus	16	9	Then Moses told Aaron , “ Talk to the whole community of Israel . Say to them , ‘ Come to the Lord . He has heard you speak against him. ’ ”
NIRV	Exodus	16	10	While Aaron was talking to the whole community of Israel , they looked toward the desert . There was the glory of the Lord appearing in the cloud !
NIRV	Exodus	16	11	The Lord said to Moses ,
NIRV	Exodus	16	12	“ I have heard the people of Israel talking about how unhappy they are . Tell them , ‘ When the sun goes down , you will eat meat . In the morning you will be filled with bread . Then you will know that I am the Lord your God. ’ ”
NIRV	Exodus	16	13	That evening quail came and covered the camp . In the morning the ground around the camp was covered with dew .
NIRV	Exodus	16	14	When the dew was gone , thin flakes appeared on the desert floor . They looked like frost on the ground .
NIRV	Exodus	16	15	The people of Israel saw the flakes . They asked each other , “ What ’ s that ? ” They didn ’ t know what it was . Moses said to them , “ It ’ s the bread the Lord has given you to eat .
NIRV	Exodus	16	17	The people of Israel did as they were told . Some gathered a lot , and some gathered a little .
NIRV	Exodus	16	18	When they measured it out , the one who gathered a lot didn ’ t have too much . And the one who gathered a little had enough . Everyone gathered only what they needed .
NIRV	Exodus	16	19	Then Moses said to them , “ Don ’ t keep any of it until morning. ”
NIRV	Exodus	16	20	Some of them didn ’ t pay any attention to Moses . They kept part of it until morning . But it was full of maggots and began to stink . So Moses became angry with them .
NIRV	Exodus	16	21	Each morning everyone gathered as much as they needed . But by the hottest time of the day , the thin flakes had melted away .
NIRV	Exodus	16	22	On the sixth day , the people gathered twice as much . It amounted to six pounds for each person . The leaders of the community came and reported that to Moses .
NIRV	Exodus	16	23	He said to them , “ Here is what the Lord commanded . He said , ‘ Tomorrow will be a day of rest . It will be a holy Sabbath day . It will be set apart for the Lord . So bake what you want to bake . Boil what you want to boil . Save what is left . Keep it until morning. ’ ”
NIRV	Exodus	16	24	So they saved it until morning , just as Moses commanded . It didn ’ t stink or get maggots in it .
NIRV	Exodus	16	25	“ Eat it today , ” Moses said . “ Today is a Sabbath day to honor the Lord . You won ’ t find any flakes on the ground today .
NIRV	Exodus	16	26	Gather them for six days . But on the seventh day there won ’ t be any . It ’ s the Sabbath day. ”
NIRV	Exodus	16	27	In spite of what Moses said , some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather the flakes . But they didn ’ t find any .
NIRV	Exodus	16	28	Then the Lord spoke to Moses . He said , “ How long will all of you refuse to obey my commands and my teachings ?
NIRV	Exodus	16	29	Keep in mind that I have given you the Sabbath day . That is why on the sixth day I give you bread for two days . Everyone must stay where they are on the seventh day . No one can go out. ”
NIRV	Exodus	16	30	So the people rested on the seventh day .
NIRV	Exodus	16	31	The people of Israel called the bread manna . It was white like coriander seeds . It tasted like wafers made with honey .
NIRV	Exodus	16	32	Moses said , “ Here is what the Lord has commanded . He has said , ‘ Get three pounds of manna . Keep it for all time to come . Then those who live after you will see the bread I gave you to eat in the desert . I gave it to you when I brought you out of Egypt. ’ ”
NIRV	Exodus	16	33	So Moses said to Aaron , “ Get a jar . Put three pounds of manna in it . Then place it in front of the Lord . Keep it there for all time to come. ”
NIRV	Exodus	16	34	Aaron did exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses . He put the manna with the tablets of the covenant law . He put it there so it would be kept for all time to come .
NIRV	Exodus	16	35	The Israelites ate manna for
NIRV	Exodus	16	40	years . They ate it until they came to a land where people were living . They ate it until they reached the border of Canaan .

NIRV	Exodus	17	17	The whole community of Israel started out from the Desert of Sin . They traveled from place to place , just as the Lord commanded . They camped at Rephidim . But there wasn ’ t any water for the people to drink .
NIRV	Exodus	17	2	So they argued with Moses . They said , “ Give us water to drink. ” Moses replied , “ Why are you arguing with me ? Why are you testing the Lord ? ”
NIRV	Exodus	17	3	But the people were thirsty for water there . So they told Moses they weren ’ t happy with him . They said , “ Why did you bring us up out of Egypt ? Did you want us , our children and our livestock to die of thirst ? ”
NIRV	Exodus	17	4	Then Moses cried out to the Lord . He said , “ What am I going to do with these people ? They are almost ready to kill me by throwing stones at me. ”
NIRV	Exodus	17	5	The Lord answered Moses . “ Go out in front of the people . Take some of the elders of Israel along with you . Take in your hand the walking stick you used when you struck the Nile River . Go .
NIRV	Exodus	17	6	I will stand there in front of you by the rock at Mount Horeb . Hit the rock . Then water will come out of it for the people to drink. ” So Moses hit the rock while the elders of Israel watched .
NIRV	Exodus	17	7	Moses called the place Massah and Meribah . That ’ s because the people of Israel argued with him there . They also tested the Lord . They asked , “ Is the Lord among us or not ? ” Joshua Wins the Battle Over the Amalekites
NIRV	Exodus	17	8	The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim .
NIRV	Exodus	17	9	Moses said to Joshua , “ Choose some of our men . Then go out and fight against the Amalekites . Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill . I ’ ll stand there holding the walking stick God gave me. ”
NIRV	Exodus	17	10	So Joshua fought against the Amalekites , just as Moses had ordered . Moses , Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill .
NIRV	Exodus	17	11	As long as Moses held up his hand , the Israelites were winning . But every time he lowered his hands , the Amalekites began to win .
NIRV	Exodus	17	12	When Moses ’ arms got tired , Aaron and Hur got a stone and put it under him . Then he sat on it . Aaron and Hur held up his hands . Aaron was on one side , and Hur was on the other . Moses ’ hands remained steady until sunset .
NIRV	Exodus	17	13	So Joshua destroyed the Amalekite army with swords .
NIRV	Exodus	17	14	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ This is something to be remembered . So write it on a scroll . Make sure Joshua knows you have done it . I will completely erase the memory of the Amalekites from the earth. ”
NIRV	Exodus	17	15	Then Moses built an altar . He called it The Lord Is My Banner .
NIRV	Exodus	17	16	He said , “ The Amalekites opposed the authority of the Lord . So the Lord will fight against the Amalekites for all time to come. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Exodus	18	2	Moses had sent his wife Zipporah to his father-in-law . So Jethro welcomed her
NIRV	Exodus	18	3	and her two sons . One son was named Gershom . That ’ s because Moses had said , “ I ’ m an outsider in a strange land. ”
NIRV	Exodus	18	4	The other was named Eliezer . That ’ s because Moses had said , “ My father ’ s God helped me . He saved me from Pharaoh ’ s sword. ”
NIRV	Exodus	18	5	Moses ’ father-in-law Jethro came to Moses in the desert . Moses ’ sons and wife came with Jethro . Moses was camped near the mountain of God .
NIRV	Exodus	18	6	Jethro had sent a message to him . It said , “ I , your father-in-law Jethro , am coming to you . I ’ m bringing your wife and her two sons. ”

NIRV	Exodus	18	12	Then Moses ’ father-in-law Jethro brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God . Aaron came with all the elders of Israel . They ate a meal with Moses ’ father-in-law in the sight of God .
NIRV	Exodus	18	13	The next day Moses took his seat to serve the people as their judge . They stood around him from morning until evening .
NIRV	Exodus	18	14	His father-in-law saw everything Moses was doing for the people . So he said , “ Aren ’ t you trying to do too much for the people ? You are the only judge . And all these people are standing around you from morning until evening. ”
NIRV	Exodus	18	15	Moses answered , “ The people come to me to find out what God wants them to do .
NIRV	Exodus	18	16	Anytime they don ’ t agree with one another , they come to me . I decide between them . I tell them about God ’ s rules and instructions. ”
NIRV	Exodus	18	17	Moses ’ father-in-law replied , “ What you are doing isn ’ t good .
NIRV	Exodus	18	19	Listen to me . I ’ ll give you some advice , and may God be with you . You must speak to God for the people . Take their problems to him .
NIRV	Exodus	18	20	Teach them his rules and instructions . Show them how to live and what to do .
NIRV	Exodus	18	21	But choose men of ability from all the people . They must have respect for God . You must be able to trust them . They must not try to get money by cheating others . Appoint them as officials over thousands , hundreds , fifties and tens .
NIRV	Exodus	18	22	Let them serve the people as judges . But have them bring every hard case to you . They can decide the easy ones themselves . That will make your load lighter . They will share it with you .
NIRV	Exodus	18	23	If this is what God wants and if you do it , then you will be able to carry the load . And all these people will go home satisfied. ”
NIRV	Exodus	18	24	Moses listened to his father-in-law . He did everything Jethro said .
NIRV	Exodus	18	25	He chose men of ability from the whole community of Israel . He made them leaders of the people . They became officials over thousands , hundreds , fifties and tens .

NIRV	Exodus	19	2	After they started out from Rephidim , they entered the Desert of Sinai . They camped there in the desert in front of the mountain .
NIRV	Exodus	19	3	Then Moses went up to God . The Lord called out to him from the mountain . He said , “ Here is what I want you to say to my people , who belong to Jacob ’ s family . Tell the Israelites ,
NIRV	Exodus	19	4	‘ You have seen for yourselves what I did to Egypt . You saw how I carried you on the wings of eagles and brought you to myself .

NIRV	Leviticus	5	5	When someone is guilty in any of those ways , they must admit they have sinned .
NIRV	Leviticus	5	2	“ ‘ Or suppose someone touches something not “ clean. ” It could be the dead bodies of wild animals or of livestock . Or it could be the dead bodies of creatures that move along the ground . Even though those people are not aware that they touched them , they have become “ unclean. ” And they are guilty .
NIRV	Leviticus	5	3	Or suppose they touch something “ unclean ” that comes from a human being . It could be anything that would make them “ unclean. ” Suppose they are not aware that they touched it . When they find out about it , they will be guilty .
NIRV	Leviticus	5	4	Or suppose someone makes a promise to do something without thinking it through . It does not matter what they promised . It does not matter whether they made the promise without thinking about it carefully . And suppose they are not aware that they did not think it through . When they find out about it , they will be guilty .
NIRV	Leviticus	5	6	They must bring a sin offering to pay for the sin they have committed . They must bring to the Lord a female lamb or goat from the flock . The priest will sacrifice the animal . That will pay for the person ’ s sin .
NIRV	Leviticus	5	7	“ ‘ Suppose they can ’ t afford a lamb . Then they must get two doves or two young pigeons . They must bring them to the Lord to pay for their sin . One of them is for a sin offering . The other is for a burnt offering .
NIRV	Leviticus	5	8	They must bring them to the priest . The priest will offer the one for the sin offering first . He must twist its head . But he must not twist it off completely .
NIRV	Leviticus	5	9	Then he must splash some of the blood of the sin offering against the side of the altar . He must empty out the rest of the blood at the bottom of the altar . It is a sin offering .
NIRV	Leviticus	5	10	Then the priest will offer the other bird as a burnt offering . He must do it in the way the law requires . That will pay for the sin they have committed . And they will be forgiven .
NIRV	Leviticus	5	11	“ ‘ But suppose they can ’ t afford two doves or two young pigeons . Then they must bring three and a half pounds of the finest flour as an offering for their sin . It is a sin offering . They must not put olive oil or incense on it . That is because it is a sin offering .
NIRV	Leviticus	5	12	They must bring it to the priest . The priest must take a handful of it . He must burn that part on the altar . It will be a reminder that all good things come from the Lord . The priest must burn it on top of the food offerings presented to the Lord . It is a sin offering .
NIRV	Leviticus	5	13	In that way the priest will pay for any of the sins they have committed . And they will be forgiven . The rest of the offering will belong to the priest . It is the same as in the case of the grain offering. ’ ” Rules for Guilt Offerings

They refuse to give the priests one of the holy things set apart for them . Then they must bring me a ram from the flock . It must not have any flaws . It must be worth the required amount of silver . The silver must be weighed out in keeping with the standard weights that are used in the sacred tent . The ram is a guilt offering . It will pay for their sin .

NIRV	Leviticus	10	9	“ You and your sons will go into the tent of meeting . When you do , you must not drink any kind of wine . If you do , you will die . This is a law that will last for all time to come .
NIRV	Leviticus	10	11	Then you will be able to teach the Israelites all the rules I have given them through Moses. ”
NIRV	Leviticus	10	12	Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar . They were Aaron ’ s two remaining sons . Moses said , “ Take the grain offering left over from the food offerings presented to the Lord . It is very holy . Make bread without yeast from it . Eat it beside the altar .
NIRV	Leviticus	10	13	Eat it in the holy area . It ’ s your share and your sons ’ share of the food offerings presented to the Lord . These rules are in keeping with the command the Lord gave me .
NIRV	Leviticus	10	14	But you and your sons and your daughters can eat the breast that was waved . You can also eat the thigh that was offered . Eat them in a ‘ clean ’ place . They have been given to you and your children . They are your share of the friendship offerings the Israelites bring .
NIRV	Leviticus	10	15	The thigh that was offered must be brought together with the fat parts of the food offerings . The breast that was waved must be brought in the same way . All of it must be lifted up and waved in front of the Lord as a wave offering . It will be the share for you and your children for all time to come . That ’ s what the Lord has commanded. ”
NIRV	Leviticus	10	16	Moses asked about the goat that was brought as the sin offering . He found out that it had been burned up . So he became angry with Eleazar and Ithamar . They were Aaron ’ s two remaining sons . Moses asked them ,
NIRV	Leviticus	10	17	“ Why didn ’ t you eat the sin offering in a place near the Holy Room ? The offering is very holy . It was given to you to take the people ’ s guilt away . It paid for their sin in the sight of the Lord .
NIRV	Leviticus	10	18	The blood of the offering wasn ’ t taken into the Holy Room . So you should have eaten the goat in a place near the Holy Room . That ’ s what I commanded. ”
NIRV	Leviticus	10	19	Aaron replied to Moses , “ Today the people sacrificed their sin offering to the Lord . They also sacrificed their burnt offerings to him . But a terrible thing has happened to me . Two of my sons have died . Would the Lord have been pleased if I had eaten the sin offering today ? ”

NIRV	Leviticus	14	34	“ You will enter the land of Canaan . I am giving it to you as your own . When you enter it , suppose I put mold in one of your houses . And suppose the mold spreads .
NIRV	Leviticus	14	35	Then the owner of that house must go and speak to the priest . He must say , ‘ I ’ ve seen something that looks like mold in my house. ’
NIRV	Leviticus	14	36	The priest must order everything to be taken out of the house . It must be done before he goes in to look carefully at the mold .

NIRV	Leviticus	14	37	He must look carefully at the mold on the walls . Suppose it looks as if it has green or red dents in it . And suppose the dents look as if they are behind the surface of the wall .
NIRV	Leviticus	14	38	Then the priest must go out the door . He must close the house up for seven days .
NIRV	Leviticus	14	39	On the seventh day the priest will return to check the house . Suppose the mold on the walls has spread .

NIRV	Leviticus	14	41	He must have all the inside walls of the house scraped . Everything scraped off must be dumped into an ‘ unclean ’ place outside the town .

NIRV	Leviticus	14	43	“ Suppose the stones have been torn out . The house has been scraped . And the walls have been coated with new clay . But the mold appears again .
NIRV	Leviticus	14	44	Then the priest must go and look things over carefully . Suppose the mold has spread in the house . Then it is the kind of mold that destroys things . The house is not ‘ clean. ’
NIRV	Leviticus	14	45	It must be torn down . The stones , the wood and all the clay coating must be torn out . All of it must be taken out of the town to an ‘ unclean ’ place .

NIRV	Leviticus	14	53	Then he must let the live bird go free in the open fields outside the town . In that way he will make the house pure . It will be ‘ clean. ’ ”

NIRV	Leviticus	16	16	That is how he will make the Most Holy Room pure . He must do it because the Israelites are not ‘ clean. ’ They have not obeyed me . They have also committed other sins . Aaron must do the same for the tent of meeting because it stands in the middle of the camp . And the camp is ‘ unclean. ’
NIRV	Leviticus	16	2	The Lord said to Moses , “ Speak to your brother Aaron . Tell him not to come into the Most Holy Room just anytime he wants to . Tell him not to come behind the curtain in front of the cover of the ark . The cover is the place where sin is paid for . If he comes behind the curtain , he will die .

NIRV	Leviticus	16	25	He will also burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar .
NIRV	Leviticus	16	26	“ The man who sets free the goat that carries the people ’ s sins away must wash his clothes . He must take a bath . After that , he can come back into the camp .

NIRV	Leviticus	24	7	By each stack put some pure incense . It will remind you that all good things come from the Lord . Burn the incense in place of the bread . The incense is a food offering presented to the Lord .
NIRV	Leviticus	24	8	The bread must be set out in front of the Lord regularly . Do it every Sabbath day . It will be Israel ’ s duty to provide it for all time to come .
NIRV	Leviticus	24	9	The bread belongs to Aaron and his sons . They must eat it in the holy area . It is a very holy part of their regular share of the food offerings presented to the Lord. ” A Person Who Speaks Evil Is Put to Death
NIRV	Leviticus	24	10	There was a man who had an Israelite mother . His father was born in Egypt . The man went out among the Israelites . A fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite .
NIRV	Leviticus	24	11	The son of the Israelite woman spoke evil things against the Lord by using a curse . So the people brought him to Moses . The name of the man ’ s mother was Shelomith . She was the daughter of Dibri . Dibri was from the tribe of Dan .
NIRV	Leviticus	24	13	Then the Lord spoke to Moses . He said ,
NIRV	Leviticus	24	14	“ Get the man who spoke evil things against the Lord . Take him outside the camp . All those who heard him say those things must place their hands on his head . Then the whole community must kill him by throwing stones at him .
NIRV	Leviticus	24	15	Say to the Israelites , ‘ Anyone who curses me will be held accountable .
NIRV	Leviticus	24	16	Anyone who speaks evil things against my Name must be put to death . The whole community must kill them by throwing stones at them . It does not matter whether they are an outsider or an Israelite . When they speak evil things against my Name , they must be put to death .
NIRV	Leviticus	24	17	“ ‘ Anyone who kills another human being must be put to death .
NIRV	Leviticus	24	18	Anyone who kills someone ’ s animal must pay its owner . A life must be taken for a life .
NIRV	Leviticus	24	19	Suppose someone hurts their neighbor . Then what they have done must be done to them .
NIRV	Leviticus	24	20	A bone must be broken for a bone . An eye must be put out for an eye . A tooth must be knocked out for a tooth . The one who has hurt his neighbor must be hurt in the same way .
NIRV	Leviticus	24	21	Whoever kills an animal must pay its owner . But if they kill a human being , they must be put to death .
NIRV	Leviticus	24	22	The same law applies whether they are an outsider or an Israelite . I am the Lord your God. ’ ”
NIRV	Leviticus	24	23	Then Moses spoke to the Israelites . They got the man who had spoken evil things against the Lord . They took him outside the camp . There they killed him by throwing stones at him . The Israelites did just as the Lord had commanded Moses . Copyright ©

NIRV	Leviticus	25	3	For six years plant your fields . Trim the branches in your vineyards and gather your crops .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	4	But the seventh year must be a year of sabbath rest for the land . The land must rest during it . It is a sabbath year to honor the Lord . Do not plant your fields . Do not trim the branches in your vineyards .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	5	Do not gather what grows without being planted . And do not gather the grapes from the vines you have not taken care of . The land must have a year of rest .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	6	Anything the land produces during the sabbath year will be food for you . It will be for you and your male and female servants . Your hired workers will eat it . So will people who live with you for a while .

NIRV	Leviticus	25	49	An uncle or a cousin can buy them back after they have sold themselves . In fact , any relative in their tribe can do it . Or suppose things go well for them . Then they can buy themselves back .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	9	The tenth day of the seventh month is the day when sin is paid for . On that day blow the trumpet all through your land .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	10	Set the 50th year apart . Announce freedom all over the land to everyone who lives there . The 50th year will be a Year of Jubilee for you . Each of you must return to your own family property . And each of you must return to your own tribe .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	11	The 50th year will be a Year of Jubilee for you . Do not plant anything . Do not gather what grows without being planted . And do not gather the grapes from the vines you have not taken care of .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	12	It is a Year of Jubilee . It will be holy for you . Eat only what the fields produce .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	13	“ ‘ In the Year of Jubilee all of you must return to your own property .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	14	“ ‘ Suppose you sell land to any of your own people . Or you buy land from them . Then do not take advantage of each other .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	15	The price you pay must be based on the number of years since the last Year of Jubilee . Here is how the price you charge must be decided . It must be based on the number of years left for gathering crops before the next Year of Jubilee .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	16	When there are many years left , you must raise the price . When there are only a few years left , you must lower the price . That is because what is really being sold to you is the number of crops the land will produce .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	17	Do not take advantage of each other . Instead , have respect for your God . I am the Lord your God .

NIRV	Leviticus	25	21	I will send you a great blessing in the sixth year . The land will produce enough for three years .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	22	While you plant during the eighth year , you will eat food from the old crop . You will continue to eat food from it until the crops from the ninth year are gathered .

NIRV	Leviticus	25	24	You must make sure that you can buy the land back . That applies to all the land that belongs to you .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	26	But suppose they do not have anyone to buy it back for them . And suppose things go well for them and they earn enough money to buy it back themselves .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	27	Then they must decide how much the crops have become worth since the time they sold the land . They must take that amount off the price the land was sold for . They must give the one selling it back to them the money that is left . Then they can go back to their own property .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	28	But suppose they have not earned enough money to pay them back . Then the buyer they sold the land to will keep it until the Year of Jubilee . At that time it will be returned to them . Then they can go back to their property .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	29	“ ‘ Suppose someone sells a house in a city that has a wall around it . Then for a full year after they sell it they have the right to buy it back .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	30	But suppose they do not buy it back before the full year has passed . Then the house in the walled city will continue to belong to the buyer and the buyer ’ s children . It will not be returned to the seller in the Year of Jubilee .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	31	But houses in villages that do not have walls around them must be treated like property outside walled cities . Those houses can be bought back at any time . And they must be returned in the Year of Jubilee .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	32	“ ‘ The Levites always have the right to buy back their houses in the towns that belong to them .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	33	So their property among the Israelites can be bought back . That applies to a house sold in any of their towns . Any house that is sold must be returned to its original owner in the Year of Jubilee . That is because the houses of the Levites will always belong to them .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	34	But the grasslands around their towns must never be sold . They will belong to them for all time to come .

NIRV	Leviticus	25	36	Do not charge them interest of any kind . Instead , have respect for God . Then those who have become poor can continue to live among you .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	37	If you lend them money , you must not charge them interest . And you must not sell them food for more than it cost you .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	38	I am the Lord your God . I brought you out of Egypt . I did it to give you the land of Canaan . I wanted to be your God .

NIRV	Leviticus	25	41	Then they and their children must be set free . They will go back to their own tribes . They will go back to the property their people have always owned .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	42	The Israelites are my servants . I brought them out of Egypt . So they must not be sold as slaves .

NIRV	Leviticus	25	45	You can also buy as slaves some of the people living among you for a while . You can also buy members of their families born among you . They will become your property .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	46	You can leave them to your children as their share of your property . You can make them slaves for life . But when you rule over your own people , you must be kind to them .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	47	“ ‘ Suppose an outsider living among you for a while becomes rich . Then suppose any of your own people become poor . Then they sell themselves to the outsider living among you . Or they sell themselves to a member of the outsider ’ s family .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	48	Then they keep the right to buy themselves back after they have sold themselves . One of their relatives can buy them back .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	50	They and their buyer must count the number of years from the time of the sale up to the Year of Jubilee . The price for their freedom must be based on the amount paid to a hired man for that number of years .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	51	Suppose there are many years until the Year of Jubilee . Then for their freedom they must pay a larger share of the price paid for them .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	52	But suppose there are only a few years left until the Year of Jubilee . Then they must count the number of years that are left . The payment for their freedom must be based on that number .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	53	They must be treated as workers hired from year to year . You must make sure that those they must work for are kind to them when they rule over them .
NIRV	Leviticus	25	54	“ ‘ Suppose they are not bought back in any of those ways . Then they and their children must still be set free in the Year of Jubilee .

They must send away all those who have liquid waste coming from their bodies . And they must send away those who are ‘ unclean ’ because they have touched a dead body .
NIRV	Numbers	5	3	That applies to men and women alike . Send them out of the camp . They must not make their camp ‘ unclean. ’ That is where I live among them. ”
NIRV	Numbers	5	4	So the Israelites did what the Lord commanded . They sent out of the camp those who were “ unclean. ” They did just as the Lord had directed Moses . Sins Against Others Must Be Paid For
NIRV	Numbers	5	6	“ Speak to the Israelites . Say to them , ‘ Suppose a man or woman does something wrong to someone else . Then that person is not being faithful to the Lord . People like that are guilty .
NIRV	Numbers	5	7	They must admit they have committed a sin . They must pay in full for what they did wrong . And they must add a fifth of the value to it . Then they must give all of it to the person they have sinned against .

NIRV	Numbers	5	10	Sacred gifts belong to their owners . But what they give to the priest will belong to the priest. ’ ” The Test for an Unfaithful Wife
NIRV	Numbers	5	11	Then the Lord spoke to Moses again . He said ,
NIRV	Numbers	5	12	“ Speak to the Israelites . Say to them , ‘ Suppose a man ’ s wife goes astray . And suppose she is not faithful to her husband .
NIRV	Numbers	5	13	Suppose another man has sex with her . And suppose this is hidden from her husband . No one knows she is not “ clean. ” So there is no witness against her . And she has not been caught in the act .
NIRV	Numbers	5	14	Suppose her husband becomes jealous . He does not trust his wife , and she is really “ unclean. ” Or suppose he does not trust her even though she is “ clean. ”
NIRV	Numbers	5	15	Then he must take his wife to the priest . He must also bring an offering . It must be eight cups of barley flour . The offering is for his wife . He must not pour olive oil on it . And he must not put incense on it . It is a grain offering for being jealous . It calls attention to the wrong thing a person has done .
NIRV	Numbers	5	16	“ ‘ The priest must have her stand in front of the Lord .
NIRV	Numbers	5	17	He must pour some holy water into a clay jar . He must get some dust from the floor of the holy tent . And he must put it into the water .
NIRV	Numbers	5	18	The priest must have the woman stand in front of the Lord . Then he must untie her hair . He must place in her hands the offering that calls attention to the wrong thing a person has done . It is the grain offering for being jealous . The priest must keep the bitter water with him . It is the water that brings a curse .
NIRV	Numbers	5	19	Then the priest must have the woman give her word . He must say to her , “ Suppose no other man has had sex with you . And suppose you haven ’ t gone astray . You have kept yourself pure while you are married to your husband . Then may the bitter water that brings a curse not harm you .
NIRV	Numbers	5	20	But suppose you have gone astray while you are married to your husband . You have made yourself ‘ unclean. ’ You have had sex with a man who isn ’ t your husband. ”
NIRV	Numbers	5	21	At that point the priest must put the woman under the curse that will come if she breaks her word . He must say , “ May the Lord cause you to become a curse among your people . You will become a curse when the Lord makes your body unable to have children .
NIRV	Numbers	5	22	May this water that brings a curse enter your body . May it make your body unable to have children. ” “ ‘ Then the woman must say , “ Amen . Let it happen. ”
NIRV	Numbers	5	23	“ ‘ The priest must write the curses on a scroll . He must wash them off in the bitter water .
NIRV	Numbers	5	24	It is the water he will make the woman drink . It is bitter water that brings a curse . It will enter her body . And it will cause her to suffer bitterly .
NIRV	Numbers	5	25	The priest must take from her hands the grain offering for being jealous . He must lift it up and wave it in front of the Lord . He must bring it to the altar .
NIRV	Numbers	5	26	Then the priest must take a handful of the grain offering . It is the offering that calls attention to the wrong thing a person has done . The priest must burn it on the altar . After that , he must have the woman drink the water .
NIRV	Numbers	5	27	Suppose she has made herself “ unclean. ” She has not been faithful to her husband . And she has drunk the water that brings a curse . Then it will go into her body . It will cause her to suffer bitterly . It will make her body unable to have children . She will become a curse .
NIRV	Numbers	5	28	Suppose the woman has not made herself “ unclean. ” But suppose she is “ clean. ” Then she will be free of guilt . And she will be able to have children .
NIRV	Numbers	5	29	“ ‘ This is the law about being jealous . It applies to a woman who has gone astray . She has made herself “ unclean ” while she is married to her husband .
NIRV	Numbers	5	30	And it applies to a man who becomes jealous . He has doubts about his wife . The priest must have her stand in front of the Lord . He must apply the entire law to her .
NIRV	Numbers	5	31	The husband will not be guilty of doing anything wrong . But the woman will be punished for her sin. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Numbers	6	6	“ ‘ And they must not go near a dead body during that whole time .
NIRV	Numbers	6	2	“ Say to the Israelites , ‘ Suppose a man or woman wants to make a special promise . They want to set themselves apart to the Lord for a certain period of time . They want to be Nazirites .
NIRV	Numbers	6	3	Then they must not drink any kind of wine . They must not drink vinegar made out of wine of any kind . They must not drink grape juice . They must not eat grapes or raisins .
NIRV	Numbers	6	4	As long as they are Nazirites , they must not eat anything grapevines produce . They must not even eat the seeds or skins of grapes .
NIRV	Numbers	6	5	“ ‘ They must not use razors on their heads . They must not cut their hair during the whole time they have set themselves apart to the Lord . They must be holy until that time is over . They must let the hair on their heads grow long .
NIRV	Numbers	6	7	But what if their father or mother dies ? Or what if their brother or sister dies ? Then they must not make themselves “ unclean ” because of them . The hair on their heads shows they are set apart for God .
NIRV	Numbers	6	8	During the whole time they are set apart they are holy to the Lord .
NIRV	Numbers	6	9	“ ‘ Suppose someone dies suddenly in front of them . That makes the hair they have set apart to the Lord “ unclean. ” So they must shave their heads on the day they will be made “ clean. ” That is the seventh day .
NIRV	Numbers	6	10	Then on the eighth day they must bring two doves . Or they can bring two young pigeons . They must bring them to the priest . He will be at the entrance to the tent of meeting .
NIRV	Numbers	6	11	The priest must offer one of the birds as a sin offering . And he must offer the other as a burnt offering . The sacrifices will pay for the sin of the Nazirite man or woman . They sinned by being near a dead body . That same day they must make their heads holy again .
NIRV	Numbers	6	12	They must set themselves apart to the Lord again . They must do it for the same period of time they had agreed to at first . And they must bring a male lamb a year old as a guilt offering . The days before that do not count . That is because they became “ unclean ” during the time they were set apart .
NIRV	Numbers	6	13	“ ‘ The time when the Nazirites are set apart will come to an end . Here is the law that applies to them at that time . They must be brought to the entrance to the tent of meeting .
NIRV	Numbers	6	14	There they must present their offerings to the Lord . They must bring a male lamb a year old . It must not have any flaws . It is for a burnt offering . Then they must bring a female lamb a year old . It must not have any flaws . It is for a sin offering . And they must bring a ram that does not have any flaws . It is for a friendship offering .
NIRV	Numbers	6	15	They must sacrifice the offerings together with their grain offerings and drink offerings . And they must also bring a basket of bread made with the finest flour . The bread must be made without yeast . The offering must include thick loaves with olive oil mixed in . And it must also include thin loaves brushed with olive oil .
NIRV	Numbers	6	16	“ ‘ The priest must bring all these things to the Lord . He must sacrifice the sin offering and the burnt offering .
NIRV	Numbers	6	17	He must bring the basket of bread made without yeast . And he must sacrifice the ram . It will be a friendship offering to the Lord . The priest must bring it together with its grain offering and drink offering .
NIRV	Numbers	6	18	“ ‘ Then the Nazirites must shave off the hair that shows they have set themselves apart to the Lord . They must do it at the entrance to the tent of meeting . And they must put the hair in the fire that burns the sacrifice of the friendship offering .
NIRV	Numbers	6	19	“ ‘ After the Nazirites have shaved off their hair , the priest must take a boiled shoulder of the ram . He must remove one thick loaf and one thin loaf from the basket . They must be made without yeast . And he must place the shoulder and the bread in the hands of the Nazirites .
NIRV	Numbers	6	20	Then he must lift up the shoulder and bread and wave them in front of the Lord . They are a wave offering . They are holy and belong to the priest . Other parts of the ram belong to the priest as well . They are the breast that was waved and the thigh that was offered . After the offering is waved , the Nazirites may drink wine .
NIRV	Numbers	6	21	“ ‘ This is the law of the Nazirites . They promise to sacrifice offerings to the Lord . They do it when they set themselves apart . And they should bring anything else they can afford . They must fulfill the promises they have made . They must do so according to the law of the Nazirites. ’ ” How the Priests Bless the People
NIRV	Numbers	6	22	The Lord spoke to Moses . He said ,
NIRV	Numbers	6	23	“ Tell Aaron and his sons , ‘ Here is how I want you to bless the Israelites . Say to them ,
NIRV	Numbers	6	24	“ ‘ “ May the Lord bless you and take good care of you .
NIRV	Numbers	6	25	May the Lord smile on you and be gracious to you .
NIRV	Numbers	6	26	May the Lord look on you with favor and give you peace. ” ’

NIRV	Numbers	8	5	The Lord spoke to Moses . He said ,
NIRV	Numbers	8	6	“ Take the Levites from among all the Israelites . Make them ‘ clean ’ in the usual way .
NIRV	Numbers	8	7	Here is how to make them pure . Sprinkle the special water on them . Then have them shave their whole bodies . Also have them wash their clothes . That is how they will make themselves pure .
NIRV	Numbers	8	9	Bring the Levites to the front of the tent of meeting . Gather the whole community of Israel together .
NIRV	Numbers	8	10	You must bring the Levites to me . The Israelites must place their hands on them .
NIRV	Numbers	8	11	Aaron must bring the Levites to me . They are a wave offering from the Israelites . That is how they will be set apart to do my work .
NIRV	Numbers	8	12	“ Then I want the Levites to place their hands on the heads of the bulls . They must sacrifice one bull as a sin offering to me . And they must sacrifice the other as a burnt offering . The blood of the bulls will pay for the sin of the Levites .
NIRV	Numbers	8	13	Have the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons . Then give them as a wave offering to me .

NIRV	Numbers	8	19	I have given the Levites as gifts to Aaron and his sons . I have taken them from among all the Israelites . I have appointed them to do the work at the tent of meeting .

NIRV	Numbers	8	20	So Moses and Aaron and all the Israelites did with the Levites just as the Lord had commanded Moses .

NIRV	Numbers	9	3	Celebrate it when the sun goes down on the 14th day of this month . Obey all its rules and laws. ”
NIRV	Numbers	9	4	So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover Feast .
NIRV	Numbers	9	5	They did it in the Desert of Sinai . They celebrated it when the sun went down on the 14th day of the first month . The Israelites did everything just as the Lord had commanded Moses .
NIRV	Numbers	9	6	But some of them couldn ’ t celebrate the Passover Feast on that day . That ’ s because they weren ’ t “ clean. ” They had gone near a dead body . So they came to Moses and Aaron that same day .
NIRV	Numbers	9	7	They said to Moses , “ We went near a dead body . So we aren ’ t ‘ clean. ’ But why should we be kept from bringing the Lord ’ s offering at the appointed time ? Why shouldn ’ t we bring it along with the other Israelites ? ”
NIRV	Numbers	9	8	Moses answered them , “ Wait until I find out what the Lord wants you to do. ”
NIRV	Numbers	9	10	“ Tell the Israelites , ‘ Suppose any of you or your children are “ unclean ” because they have gone near a dead body . Or suppose they are away on a journey . They must still celebrate the Lord ’ s Passover .
NIRV	Numbers	9	11	They must celebrate it on the 14th day of the second month . They must do so when the sun goes down . They must eat the lamb together with bread made without yeast . They must eat it with bitter plants .
NIRV	Numbers	9	12	They must not leave any of it until morning . They must not break any of its bones . When they celebrate the Passover Feast , they must follow all the rules .
NIRV	Numbers	9	13	But suppose someone is “ clean ” and not on a journey . And they fail to celebrate the Passover Feast . Then they must be separated from the community of Israel . They did not bring the Lord ’ s offering at the appointed time . They will be punished for their sin .
NIRV	Numbers	9	14	“ ‘ What if there is an outsider living among you ? And what if they want to celebrate the Lord ’ s Passover ? Then they must obey its rules and laws . You must have the same laws for outsiders as you do for the Israelites. ’ ” The Cloud Covers the Holy Tent
NIRV	Numbers	9	15	The holy tent was set up . It was the tent where the tablets of the covenant law were kept . On the day it was set up , the cloud covered it . From evening until morning the cloud above the tent looked like fire .
NIRV	Numbers	9	16	That ’ s what continued to happen . The cloud covered the tent . At night the cloud looked like fire .
NIRV	Numbers	9	17	When the cloud lifted from its place above the tent , the Israelites started out . Where the cloud settled , the Israelites camped .
NIRV	Numbers	9	18	When the Lord gave the command , the Israelites started out . And when he gave the command , they camped . As long as the cloud stayed above the holy tent , they remained in camp .
NIRV	Numbers	9	19	Sometimes the cloud remained above the tent for a long time . Then the Israelites obeyed the Lord ’ s order . They didn ’ t start out .
NIRV	Numbers	9	20	Sometimes the cloud was above the tent for only a few days . When the Lord would give the command , they would camp . And when he would give the command , they would start out .
NIRV	Numbers	9	21	Sometimes the cloud stayed only from evening until morning . When it lifted in the morning , they started out . It didn ’ t matter whether it was day or night . When the cloud lifted , the people started out .
NIRV	Numbers	9	22	It didn ’ t matter whether the cloud stayed above the holy tent for two days or a month or a year . The Israelites would remain in camp . They wouldn ’ t start out . But when the cloud lifted , they would start out .
NIRV	Numbers	9	23	When the Lord gave the command , they camped . And when he gave the command , they started out . They obeyed the Lord ’ s order . They obeyed him , just as he had commanded them through Moses . Copyright ©

NIRV	Numbers	11	11	He asked the Lord , “ Why have you brought this trouble on me ? Why aren ’ t you pleased with me ? Why have you loaded me down with the troubles of all these people ?
NIRV	Numbers	11	2	The people cried out to Moses . Then he prayed to the Lord . And the fire died down .
NIRV	Numbers	11	3	So that place was named Taberah . That ’ s because fire from the Lord had blazed out among them there . The Lord Sends Quail for the People to Eat
NIRV	Numbers	11	4	Some people with them began to wish for other food . Again the Israelites began to cry out . They said , “ We wish we had meat to eat .
NIRV	Numbers	11	5	We remember the fish we ate in Egypt . It didn ’ t cost us anything . We also remember the cucumbers , melons , leeks , onions and garlic .
NIRV	Numbers	11	6	But now we ’ ve lost all interest in eating . We never see anything but this manna ! ”
NIRV	Numbers	11	7	The manna was like coriander seeds . It looked like sap from a tree .
NIRV	Numbers	11	8	The people went around gathering it . Then they ground it up in a small mill they held in their hands . Or they crushed it in a stone bowl . They cooked it in a pot . Or they made loaves out of it . It tasted like something made with olive oil .
NIRV	Numbers	11	9	When the dew came down on the camp at night , the manna also came down .
NIRV	Numbers	11	10	Moses heard people from every family crying at the entrances to their tents . The Lord became very angry . So Moses became upset .
NIRV	Numbers	11	12	Am I like a mother to them ? Are they my children ? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms ? Do I have to carry them the way a nurse carries a baby ? Do I have to carry them to the land you promised ? You promised the land to their people of long ago .
NIRV	Numbers	11	13	Where can I get meat for all these people ? They keep crying out to me . They say , ‘ Give us meat to eat ! ’
NIRV	Numbers	11	14	I can ’ t carry all these people by myself . The load is too heavy for me .
NIRV	Numbers	11	15	Is this how you are going to treat me ? If you are pleased with me , just put me to death right now . Don ’ t let me live if I have to see myself destroyed anyway. ”
NIRV	Numbers	11	16	The Lord said to Moses , “ Bring me
NIRV	Numbers	11	70	elders . When the Spirit came on them , they prophesied . But they didn ’ t do it again .
NIRV	Numbers	11	17	I will come down and speak with you there . I will take some of the power of the Spirit that is on you . And I will put it on them . They will share the responsibility of these people with you . Then you will not have to carry it alone .
NIRV	Numbers	11	18	“ Tell the people , ‘ Set yourselves apart for tomorrow . At that time you will eat meat . The Lord heard you when you cried out . You said , “ We wish we had meat to eat . We were better off in Egypt . Now the Lord will give you meat . And you will eat it .
NIRV	Numbers	11	19	You will not eat it for just one or two days . You will not eat it for just five , ten or
NIRV	Numbers	11	20	Instead , you will eat it for a whole month . You will eat it until it comes out of your noses . You will eat it until you hate it . The Lord is among you . But you have turned your back on him . You have cried out while he was listening . You have said , “ Why did we ever leave Egypt ? ” ’ ”
NIRV	Numbers	11	21	But Moses said to the Lord , “ Here I am among 600,000 men on the march . And you say , ‘ I will give them meat to eat for a whole month ’ !
NIRV	Numbers	11	22	Would they have enough if flocks and herds were killed for them ? Would they have enough even if all the fish in the ocean were caught for them ? ”
NIRV	Numbers	11	23	The Lord answered Moses , “ Am I not strong enough ? Now you will see whether what I say will come true for you. ”
NIRV	Numbers	11	24	So Moses went out . He told the people what the Lord had said . He gathered
NIRV	Numbers	11	25	Then the Lord came down in the cloud . He spoke with Moses . He took some of the power of the Spirit that was on Moses . And he put it on the
NIRV	Numbers	11	26	Two men had remained in the camp . Their names were Eldad and Medad . They were listed among the elders . But they didn ’ t go out to the tent of meeting . In spite of that , the Spirit came on them too . So they prophesied in the camp .
NIRV	Numbers	11	27	A young man ran up to Moses . He said , “ Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp. ”
NIRV	Numbers	11	28	Joshua spoke up . He was the son of Nun . Joshua had been Moses ’ helper from the time he was young . He said , “ Moses ! Please stop them ! ”
NIRV	Numbers	11	29	But Moses replied , “ Are you jealous for me ? I wish that all the Lord ’ s people were prophets . And I wish that the Lord would put his Spirit on them. ”
NIRV	Numbers	11	30	Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp .
NIRV	Numbers	11	31	The Lord sent out a wind . It drove quail in from the Red Sea . It scattered them all around the camp . They were about three feet above the ground . They could be seen in every direction as far as a person could walk in a day .
NIRV	Numbers	11	32	The people went out all day and gathered quail . They gathered them all night and all the next day . No one gathered less than
NIRV	Numbers	11	60	bushels . Then they spread the quail out all around the camp .
NIRV	Numbers	11	33	But while the meat was still in their mouths , the Lord acted . Before the people could swallow it , he became very angry with them . He struck them with a terrible plague .
NIRV	Numbers	11	34	So the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah . That ’ s where the bodies of the people who had wished for other food were buried .

NIRV	Numbers	12	2	“ Has the Lord spoken only through Moses ? ” they asked . “ Hasn ’ t he also spoken through us ? ” The Lord heard what they said .
NIRV	Numbers	12	3	Moses was a very humble man . In fact , he was more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth .
NIRV	Numbers	12	4	The Lord spoke to Moses , Aaron and Miriam . He said , “ All three of you , come out to the tent of meeting. ” So they did .
NIRV	Numbers	12	5	Then the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud . He stood at the entrance to the tent . And he told Aaron and Miriam to come to him . The two of them stepped forward .
NIRV	Numbers	12	6	Then the Lord said , “ Listen to my words . “ Suppose there is a prophet among you . I , the Lord , make myself known to them in visions . I speak to them in dreams .
NIRV	Numbers	12	7	But this is not true of my servant Moses . He is faithful in everything he does in my house .
NIRV	Numbers	12	8	With Moses I speak face to face . I speak with him clearly . I do not speak in riddles . I let him see something of what I look like . So why were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses ? ”
NIRV	Numbers	12	9	The Lord was very angry with them . And he left them .
NIRV	Numbers	12	10	When the cloud went up from above the tent , there stood Miriam . She had a disease that made her skin as white as snow . Aaron turned toward her . He saw that she had a skin disease .
NIRV	Numbers	12	11	So he said to Moses , “ We have committed a very foolish sin . Please don ’ t hold it against us .
NIRV	Numbers	12	13	So Moses cried out to the Lord . He said , “ Please , God , heal her ! ”
NIRV	Numbers	12	14	The Lord answered Moses . He said , “ Suppose her father had spit in her face . Then she would have been put to shame for seven days . So keep her outside the camp for seven days . After that , you can bring her back. ”
NIRV	Numbers	12	15	So Miriam was kept outside the camp for seven days . The people didn ’ t move on until she was brought back .

NIRV	Numbers	13	19	What kind of land do they live in ? Is it good or bad ? What kind of towns do they live in ? Do the towns have high walls around them or not ?
NIRV	Numbers	13	20	How is the soil ? Is it rich land or poor land ? Are there trees in it or not ? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land. ” It was the season for the first ripe grapes .
NIRV	Numbers	13	21	So the men went up and checked out the land . They went from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob . It was in the direction of Lebo Hamath .
NIRV	Numbers	13	22	They went up through the Negev Desert and came to Hebron . That ’ s where Ahiman , Sheshai and Talmai lived . They belonged to the family line of Anak . Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan . Zoan was a city in Egypt .
NIRV	Numbers	13	23	The men came to the Valley of Eshkol . There they cut off a branch that had a single bunch of grapes on it . Two of them carried it on a pole between them . They carried some pomegranates and figs along with it .
NIRV	Numbers	13	24	That place was called the Valley of Eshkol . That ’ s because the men of Israel cut off a bunch of grapes there .
NIRV	Numbers	13	25	At the end of
NIRV	Numbers	13	40	days , the men returned from checking out the land . The Men Report on What They Found
NIRV	Numbers	13	26	The men came back to Moses , Aaron and the whole community of Israel . The people were at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran . There the men reported to Moses and Aaron and all the people . They showed them the fruit of the land .
NIRV	Numbers	13	27	They gave Moses their report . They said , “ We went into the land you sent us to . It really does have plenty of milk and honey ! Here ’ s some fruit from the land .
NIRV	Numbers	13	28	But the people who live there are powerful . Their cities have high walls around them and are very large . We even saw members of the family line of Anak there .
NIRV	Numbers	13	29	The Amalekites live in the Negev Desert . The Hittites , Jebusites and Amorites live in the central hill country . The Canaanites live near the Mediterranean Sea . They also live along the Jordan River. ”

NIRV	Numbers	13	31	But the men who had gone up with him spoke . They said , “ We can ’ t attack those people . They are stronger than we are. ”
NIRV	Numbers	13	32	The men spread a bad report about the land among the Israelites . They said , “ The land we checked out destroys those who live in it . All the people we saw there are very big and tall .

NIRV	Numbers	14	14	And the Egyptians will tell the people who live in Canaan about it . Lord , they have already heard a lot about you . They ’ ve heard that you are with these people . They ’ ve heard that you have been seen face to face . They ’ ve been told that your cloud stays over them . They ’ ve heard that you go in front of them in a pillar of cloud by day . They ’ ve been told that you go in front of them in a pillar of fire at night .
NIRV	Numbers	14	2	The Israelites spoke against Moses and Aaron . The whole community said to them , “ We wish we had died in Egypt or even in this desert .
NIRV	Numbers	14	3	Why is the Lord bringing us to this land ? We ’ re going to be killed by swords . Our enemies will capture our wives and children . Wouldn ’ t it be better for us to go back to Egypt ? ”
NIRV	Numbers	14	4	They said to one another , “ We should choose another leader . We should go back to Egypt. ”
NIRV	Numbers	14	5	Then Moses and Aaron fell with their faces to the ground . They did it in front of the whole community of Israel gathered there .
NIRV	Numbers	14	6	Joshua , the son of Nun , tore his clothes . So did Caleb , the son of Jephunneh . Joshua and Caleb were two of the men who had checked out the land .
NIRV	Numbers	14	7	They spoke to the whole community of Israel . They said , “ We passed through the land and checked it out . It ’ s very good .
NIRV	Numbers	14	8	If the Lord is pleased with us , he ’ ll lead us into that land . It ’ s a land that has plenty of milk and honey . He ’ ll give it to us .
NIRV	Numbers	14	9	But don ’ t refuse to obey him . And don ’ t be afraid of the people of the land . We will swallow them up . The Lord is with us . So nothing can save them . Don ’ t be afraid of them. ”
NIRV	Numbers	14	10	But all the people talked about killing Joshua and Caleb by throwing stones at them . Then the glory of the Lord appeared at the tent of meeting . All the Israelites saw it .
NIRV	Numbers	14	11	The Lord said to Moses , “ How long will these people not respect me ? How long will they refuse to believe in me ? They refuse even though I have done many signs among them .
NIRV	Numbers	14	12	So I will strike them down with a plague . I will destroy them . But I will make you into a greater and stronger nation than they are. ”
NIRV	Numbers	14	13	Moses said to the Lord , “ Then the Egyptians will hear about it . You used your power to bring these people up from among them .
NIRV	Numbers	14	15	Suppose you put all these people to death and leave none alive . Then the nations who have heard these things about you will talk . They ’ ll say ,
NIRV	Numbers	14	16	‘ The Lord promised to give these people the land of Canaan . But he wasn ’ t able to bring them into it . So he killed them in the desert. ’
NIRV	Numbers	14	17	“ Now , Lord , show your strength . You have said ,
NIRV	Numbers	14	18	‘ I am the Lord . I am slow to get angry . I am full of love . I forgive those who sin . I forgive those who refuse to obey . But I do not let guilty people go without punishing them . I cause the sin of the parents to affect their children , grandchildren and great-grandchildren. ’
NIRV	Numbers	14	19	Lord , your love is great . So forgive the sin of these people . Forgive them just as you have done from the time they left Egypt until now. ”
NIRV	Numbers	14	20	years old or more will die . Every one of you who was counted in the list of the people will die . Every one of you who has spoken out against me will be wiped out .
NIRV	Numbers	14	21	You can be sure that I live . You can be just as sure that my glory fills the whole earth .
NIRV	Numbers	14	22	And here is what you can be just as sure of . Not one of these people will see the land I promised to give them . They have seen my glory . They have seen the signs I did in Egypt . And they have seen what I did in the desert . But they did not obey me . And they have tested me ten times .
NIRV	Numbers	14	23	So not even one of them will ever see the land I promised to give to their people of long ago . The person who has not respected me will never see it .
NIRV	Numbers	14	24	But my servant Caleb has a different spirit . He follows me with his whole heart . So I will bring him into the land he went to . And his children after him will receive land there .
NIRV	Numbers	14	25	The Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys . So turn back tomorrow . Start out toward the desert . Go along the way that leads to the Red Sea. ”
NIRV	Numbers	14	26	The Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
NIRV	Numbers	14	27	“ How long will this evil community speak against me ? I have heard these Israelites talk about how unhappy they are .
NIRV	Numbers	14	28	So tell them , ‘ Here is what I am announcing . I am the Lord . You can be sure that I live . And here is what you can be just as sure of . I will do to you the very thing that I heard you say .
NIRV	Numbers	14	29	You will die in this desert . Every one of you
NIRV	Numbers	14	30	I lifted up my hand and promised to make this land your home . But now not all of you will enter the land . Caleb , the son of Jephunneh , will enter it . So will Joshua , the son of Nun . They are the only ones who will enter the land .
NIRV	Numbers	14	31	You have said that your enemies would capture your children . But I will bring your children in to enjoy the land you have turned your backs on .
NIRV	Numbers	14	32	As for you , you will die in the desert .
NIRV	Numbers	14	33	Your children will be shepherds here for
NIRV	Numbers	14	40	Early the next morning they set out for the highest point in the hill country . “ We have sinned , ” they said . “ Now we are ready to go up to the land the Lord promised to give us. ”
NIRV	Numbers	14	34	For
NIRV	Numbers	14	35	I , the Lord , have spoken . I will surely do these things to this entire evil community of Israel . They have joined together against me . They will meet their end in this desert . They will die here. ”
NIRV	Numbers	14	36	So the Lord struck down the men Moses had sent to check out the land . They had returned and had spread a bad report about the land . And that had made the whole community speak out against Moses .
NIRV	Numbers	14	37	Those men were to blame for spreading the bad report . So the Lord struck them down . They died of a plague .
NIRV	Numbers	14	38	Only two of the men who went to check out the land remained alive . One of them was Joshua , the son of Nun . The other was Caleb , the son of Jephunneh .
NIRV	Numbers	14	39	Moses reported to all the Israelites what the Lord had said . And they became very sad .
NIRV	Numbers	14	41	But Moses said , “ Why aren ’ t you obeying the Lord ’ s command ? You won ’ t succeed .
NIRV	Numbers	14	42	So don ’ t go up . The Lord isn ’ t with you . Your enemies will win the battle over you .
NIRV	Numbers	14	43	The Amalekites and the Canaanites will meet you on the field of battle . You have turned away from the Lord . So he won ’ t be with you . And you will be killed by swords. ”
NIRV	Numbers	14	44	But they wouldn ’ t listen . They still went up toward the highest point in the hill country . They went up even though Moses didn ’ t move from the camp . They went even though the ark of the Lord ’ s covenant didn ’ t move from the camp .
NIRV	Numbers	14	45	Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down . They attacked the Israelites . They won the battle over them . They chased the Israelites all the way to Hormah . Copyright ©

NIRV	Numbers	15	19	You will eat its food . When you do , present part of it as an offering to the Lord .
NIRV	Numbers	15	20	Present a loaf made from the first flour you grind . Present it as an offering from the threshing floor .
NIRV	Numbers	15	21	You must present the offering to the Lord . You must present it from the first grain you grind . You must do it for all time to come . Offerings for Sins That Aren ’ t Committed on Purpose
NIRV	Numbers	15	22	“ ‘ Suppose you as a community fail to keep any of the commands the Lord gave Moses . And suppose you do it without meaning to .
NIRV	Numbers	15	23	That applies to any of the commands the Lord told Moses to give you . And they are in effect from the day the Lord gave them and for all time to come .
NIRV	Numbers	15	25	With it the priest will pay for the sin of the whole community of Israel . Then they will be forgiven . They did not mean to commit that sin . And they have presented to the Lord a food offering for the wrong thing they did . They have brought a sin offering with it .
NIRV	Numbers	15	26	The Lord will forgive the whole community of Israel and the outsiders living among them . All the people had a part in the sin , even though they did not mean to do it .
NIRV	Numbers	15	27	“ ‘ But suppose just one person sins without meaning to . Then that person must bring a female goat for a sin offering . It must be a year old .
NIRV	Numbers	15	28	With it the priest will pay for the person ’ s sin in front of the Lord . The priest will do it for the one who did wrong by sinning without meaning to . When the sin is paid for , that person will be forgiven .
NIRV	Numbers	15	29	The same law applies to everyone who sins without meaning to . It does not matter whether they are an Israelite or an outsider .
NIRV	Numbers	15	30	“ ‘ But suppose someone sins on purpose . It does not matter whether they are an Israelite or an outsider . They speak evil things against the Lord . They must be separated from the community of Israel .
NIRV	Numbers	15	31	They have not respected what the Lord has said . They have broken the Lord ’ s commands . They must certainly be separated from the community . They are still guilty. ’ ” A Man Works on the Sabbath Day
NIRV	Numbers	15	32	The Israelites were in the desert . One Sabbath day , people saw a man gathering wood .
NIRV	Numbers	15	33	They brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole community .
NIRV	Numbers	15	34	They kept him under guard . It wasn ’ t clear what should be done to him .
NIRV	Numbers	15	35	Then the Lord said to Moses , “ The man must die . The whole community must kill him by throwing stones at him . They must do it outside the camp. ”
NIRV	Numbers	15	36	So the people took the man outside the camp . There they killed him by throwing stones at him . They did just as the Lord had commanded Moses . Tassels on Clothes
NIRV	Numbers	15	37	The Lord said to Moses ,
NIRV	Numbers	15	38	“ Say to the Israelites , ‘ You must make tassels on the corners of your clothes . A blue cord must be on each tassel . You must do it for all time to come .
NIRV	Numbers	15	39	You will have the tassels to look at . They will remind you to obey all the Lord ’ s commands . Then you will be faithful to him . You will not chase after what your own hearts and eyes wish for .
NIRV	Numbers	15	40	You will remember to obey all my commands . And you will be set apart for your God .
NIRV	Numbers	15	41	I am the Lord your God . I brought you out of Egypt to be your God . I am the Lord your God. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Numbers	16	16	Moses said to Korah , “ You and all your followers must stand in front of the Lord tomorrow . You must appear there along with Aaron .
NIRV	Numbers	16	2	All those men rose up against Moses . And
NIRV	Numbers	16	250	men offering the incense .
NIRV	Numbers	16	3	They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron . They said to Moses and Aaron , “ You have gone too far ! The whole community is holy . Every one in it is holy . And the Lord is with them . So why do you put yourselves above the Lord ’ s people ? ”
NIRV	Numbers	16	4	When Moses heard what they said , he fell with his face to the ground .
NIRV	Numbers	16	5	Then he spoke to Korah and all his followers . He said , “ In the morning the Lord will show who belongs to him . He will show who is holy . He ’ ll bring that person near him . He ’ ll bring the man he chooses near him .
NIRV	Numbers	16	6	Korah , here ’ s what you and all your followers must do . Get some shallow cups for burning incense .
NIRV	Numbers	16	7	Tomorrow put burning coals and incense in them . Offer it to the Lord . The man the Lord chooses will be the one who is holy . You Levites have gone too far ! ”
NIRV	Numbers	16	8	Moses also said to Korah , “ Listen , you Levites !
NIRV	Numbers	16	9	The God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the community of Israel . He has brought you near him to work at the Lord ’ s holy tent . He has given you to the people so that you can serve them . Isn ’ t all that enough for you ?
NIRV	Numbers	16	10	He has already brought you and all the other Levites near him . But now you want to be priests too .
NIRV	Numbers	16	11	You and all your followers have joined together against the Lord . Why are you telling Aaron you aren ’ t happy with him ? ”
NIRV	Numbers	16	12	Then Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab . But they said , “ We won ’ t come !
NIRV	Numbers	16	13	You have brought us up out of a land that has plenty of milk and honey . You have brought us here to kill us in this desert . Isn ’ t that enough ? Now do you also want to act as if you were ruling over us ?
NIRV	Numbers	16	14	Besides , you haven ’ t brought us into a land that has plenty of milk and honey . You haven ’ t given us fields and vineyards of our own . Do you want to treat these men like slaves ? No ! We won ’ t come ! ”
NIRV	Numbers	16	15	Then Moses became very angry . He said to the Lord , “ Don ’ t accept their offering . I haven ’ t taken even a donkey from them . In fact , I haven ’ t done anything wrong to any of them. ”
NIRV	Numbers	16	17	Each man must get his shallow cup . He must put incense in it . There will be a total of
NIRV	Numbers	16	18	So each of them got his cup . He put burning coals and incense in it . All the men came with Moses and Aaron . They stood at the entrance to the tent of meeting .
NIRV	Numbers	16	19	Korah gathered all his followers together at the entrance to the tent . They opposed Moses and Aaron . Then the glory of the Lord appeared to the whole community .
NIRV	Numbers	16	20	The Lord said to Moses and Aaron ,
NIRV	Numbers	16	21	“ Separate yourselves from these people . Then I can put an end to all of them at once. ”
NIRV	Numbers	16	22	But Moses and Aaron fell with their faces to the ground . They cried out , “ God , you are the God who gives life and breath to all living things . Will you be angry with the whole community when only one man sins ? ”
NIRV	Numbers	16	23	Then the Lord spoke to Moses . He said ,
NIRV	Numbers	16	24	“ Tell the community , ‘ Move away from the tents of Korah , Dathan and Abiram. ’ ”
NIRV	Numbers	16	25	Moses got up . He went to Dathan and Abiram . The elders of Israel followed him .
NIRV	Numbers	16	26	Moses warned the community . He said , “ Move away from the tents of these evil men ! Don ’ t touch anything that belongs to them . If you do , the Lord will sweep you away because of all their sins. ”
NIRV	Numbers	16	27	So they moved away from the tents of Korah , Dathan and Abiram . Dathan and Abiram had already come out . They were standing at the entrances to their tents . Their wives , children and little ones were standing there with them .
NIRV	Numbers	16	28	Then Moses said , “ What is about to happen wasn ’ t my idea . The Lord has sent me to do everything I ’ m doing . Here is how you will know I ’ m telling you the truth .
NIRV	Numbers	16	29	These men won ’ t die a natural death . Something will happen to them that doesn ’ t usually happen to people . If what I ’ m telling you doesn ’ t happen , then you will know that the Lord hasn ’ t sent me .
NIRV	Numbers	16	30	But the Lord will make something totally new happen . The ground will open its mouth and swallow them up . It will swallow up everything that belongs to them . They will be buried alive . When that happens , you will know that these men have disrespected the Lord. ”
NIRV	Numbers	16	31	As soon as Moses finished saying all these words , what he had said came true . The ground under them broke open .
NIRV	Numbers	16	32	It opened its mouth . It swallowed up those men . In fact , it swallowed up everyone who lived in their houses . It swallowed all Korah ’ s men . And it swallowed up everything they owned .
NIRV	Numbers	16	33	They went down into the grave alive . Everything they owned went down with them . The ground closed over them and they died . And so they disappeared from the community .
NIRV	Numbers	16	34	All the Israelites around them heard their cries . They ran away from them . They shouted , “ The ground is going to swallow us up too ! ”
NIRV	Numbers	16	35	Then the Lord sent down fire . It burned up the
NIRV	Numbers	16	36	The Lord said to Moses ,
NIRV	Numbers	16	37	“ Speak to Eleazar the priest . He is the son of Aaron . Remind him that the shallow cups are holy . He must take them out of the ashes . He must scatter the burning coals away from there .
NIRV	Numbers	16	38	The men who sinned used those cups . And it cost them their lives . Hammer the cups into bronze sheets that will cover the altar . The cups were offered to the Lord . They have become holy . Let them serve as a warning to the Israelites. ”
NIRV	Numbers	16	39	So the priest Eleazar collected the bronze incense cups . They had been brought by the men who had been burned to death . He had them hammered out to cover the altar .
NIRV	Numbers	16	40	He did just as the Lord had directed Moses to tell him to do . The covering would be a reminder to the Israelites . It would remind them that no one except a son of Aaron should come and burn incense to the Lord . If people other than priests did that , they would become like Korah and his followers .
NIRV	Numbers	16	41	The next day the whole community of Israel told Moses and Aaron they weren ’ t happy with them . “ You have killed the Lord ’ s people , ” they said .
NIRV	Numbers	16	42	The community gathered together to oppose Moses and Aaron . The people walked toward the tent of meeting . Suddenly the cloud covered it . The glory of the Lord appeared .
NIRV	Numbers	16	43	Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting .
NIRV	Numbers	16	44	The Lord said to Moses ,
NIRV	Numbers	16	45	“ Get away from these people . Then I can put an end to all of them at once. ” And Moses and Aaron fell with their faces to the ground .
NIRV	Numbers	16	46	Moses said to Aaron , “ Take your incense cup . Put incense in it . And put burning coals from the altar in it . Then hurry to the people and pay for their sin . The Lord has begun to show his anger . The plague has started. ”
NIRV	Numbers	16	47	So Aaron did as Moses said . He ran in among the people . The plague had already started among them . But Aaron offered the incense and paid for their sin .
NIRV	Numbers	16	48	He stood between those alive and those dead . And the plague stopped .
NIRV	Numbers	16	49	But 14,700 people died from the plague . That doesn ’ t include those who had died because of what Korah did .
NIRV	Numbers	16	50	Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting . The plague had stopped . Copyright ©

NIRV	Numbers	17	3	Write Aaron ’ s name on Levi ’ s walking stick . There must be one stick for the head of each of Israel ’ s tribes .
NIRV	Numbers	17	4	Put the walking sticks in the tent of meeting . Place them in front of the ark where the tablets of the covenant law are kept . That is where I meet with you .
NIRV	Numbers	17	5	The walking stick that belongs to the man I choose will begin to grow new shoots . The Israelites are never happy with what you do . I will put an end to what they are saying. ”
NIRV	Numbers	17	6	So Moses spoke to the Israelites . Their leaders gave him
NIRV	Numbers	17	7	Moses put the sticks in front of the Lord in the tent where the tablets of the covenant law were kept .
NIRV	Numbers	17	8	The next day Moses entered the tent . He looked at Aaron ’ s walking stick . It stood for the tribe of Levi . Moses saw that it had begun to grow new shoots . It had also produced buds and flowers and almonds .
NIRV	Numbers	17	9	Then Moses brought out all the walking sticks from in front of the Lord . He brought them to all the Israelites . They looked at them . And each man took his own walking stick .
NIRV	Numbers	17	10	The Lord said to Moses , “ Put Aaron ’ s walking stick back in front of the ark where the tablets of the covenant law are kept . The stick will be kept there as a warning to those who refuse to obey . They are never happy with what I do . Aaron ’ s walking stick will put an end to what they are saying .

NIRV	Numbers	18	18	The meat will belong to you . It is just like the breast and the right thigh of the wave offering . Those parts belong to you .
NIRV	Numbers	18	2	Bring the Levites from your tribe to join you . They will help you when you and your sons serve at the tent of meeting . That is where the tablets of the covenant law are kept .
NIRV	Numbers	18	3	The Levites will work for you . They must do everything that needs to be done at the tent . But they must not go near anything that belongs to the sacred tent . And they must not go near the altar . If they do , they and you will die .
NIRV	Numbers	18	4	They will help you take care of the tent of meeting . They will join you in all the work at the tent . No one else can come near you there .
NIRV	Numbers	18	5	“ You will be responsible for taking care of the sacred tent and the altar . Then I will not be angry with the Israelites again .

It is a gift from me . Anyone else who comes near the sacred tent must be put to death. ” Offerings for Priests and Levites
NIRV	Numbers	18	8	Then the Lord spoke to Aaron . He said , “ I have put you in charge of the offerings brought to me . The Israelites will give me holy offerings . I will give all their offerings to you and your sons . They are the part that belongs to you . They are your share for all time to come .
NIRV	Numbers	18	9	You will have a part of the very holy offerings . It is the part not burned in the fire . That part belongs to you and your sons . You will have a part of all the gifts the people bring me as very holy offerings . It does not matter whether they are grain offerings or sin offerings or guilt offerings .
NIRV	Numbers	18	10	Eat your part as something that is very holy . Every male will eat it . You must consider it holy .
NIRV	Numbers	18	11	“ Part of the gifts the Israelites bring as wave offerings will be set aside . That part will also belong to you . I will give it to you and your sons and daughters . It is your share for all time to come . Everyone in your home who is ‘ clean ’ can eat it .
NIRV	Numbers	18	12	“ I will give you all the finest olive oil and grain the people give me . And I will give you all the finest fresh wine they give me . They give all those things as the first share of their harvest .
NIRV	Numbers	18	13	All the first shares of the harvest they bring me will belong to you . Everyone in your home who is ‘ clean ’ can eat it .
NIRV	Numbers	18	14	“ Everything in Israel that is set apart to me belongs to you .
NIRV	Numbers	18	15	Offer to me every male born first to its mother . It belongs to you . That includes humans and animals alike . But you must buy back every oldest son . Suppose certain animals are ‘ unclean. ’ Then you must buy back every male born first to its mother .
NIRV	Numbers	18	16	When they are a month old , you must buy them back . You must pay the price to buy them back . The price is set at two ounces of silver . It must be weighed out according to the standard weights used in the sacred tent .
NIRV	Numbers	18	17	“ But you must not buy back any male calf , sheep or goat born first . They are holy . Splash their blood against the altar . And burn their fat as a food offering . Its smell pleases me .
NIRV	Numbers	18	19	Part of the holy offerings the Israelites bring to me will be set aside . No matter what it is , I will give it to you and your sons and daughters . It is your share for all time to come . It is a covenant of salt from me . The salt means that the covenant will last for all time to come for you and your children. ”
NIRV	Numbers	18	20	The Lord spoke to Aaron . He said , “ You will not receive any part of the land I am giving to Israel . You will not have any share among them . I am your share . I am what you will receive among the Israelites .
NIRV	Numbers	18	21	“ The Israelites will give me a tenth of everything they produce . And I will give it to the Levites . They serve at the tent of meeting . I will give them the tenth for the work they do there .
NIRV	Numbers	18	22	From now on the Israelites must not go near the tent of meeting . If they do , they will be punished for their sin . They will die .
NIRV	Numbers	18	23	The Levites will do the work at the tent of meeting . They will be responsible for any sins connected with the tent . This is a law that will last for all time to come . The Levites will not receive any share among the Israelites .
NIRV	Numbers	18	24	Instead , I will give the Levites the tenth as their share . It is the tenth that the Israelites bring me as an offering . That is why I said the Levites would not have any share of land among the Israelites. ”
NIRV	Numbers	18	25	The Lord said to Moses ,
NIRV	Numbers	18	26	“ Speak to the Levites . Say to them , ‘ You will receive the tenth from the Israelites . I will give it to you as your share . When I do , you must give a tenth of that tenth as an offering to the Lord .
NIRV	Numbers	18	27	Your offering will be considered as if you gave grain from a threshing floor . It will be considered as juice from a winepress .
NIRV	Numbers	18	28	In that way , you also will bring an offering to the Lord . You will bring it from the tenth you receive from the Israelites . You must give the Lord ’ s part to the priest Aaron . You must bring it from the tenth you receive .
NIRV	Numbers	18	29	You must bring to the Lord a part of everything given to you . It must be the best and holiest part. ’

NIRV	Numbers	19	5	While he watches , the young cow must be burned . Its hide , meat , blood and guts must be burned .
NIRV	Numbers	19	6	The priest must get some cedar wood , branches of a hyssop plant , and bright red wool . He must throw them on the young cow as it burns .

NIRV	Numbers	19	13	Anyone who touches a dead person ’ s body and does not make themselves pure and ‘ clean ’ makes my holy tent ‘ unclean. ’ They must be separated from Israel . The special water has not been sprinkled on them . So they are ‘ unclean. ’ And they remain ‘ unclean. ’

NIRV	Numbers	20	20	Again the people of Edom answered , “ We won ’ t let you pass through here. ” Then the people of Edom marched out against them . They came with a large and powerful army .
NIRV	Numbers	20	2	The people didn ’ t have any water . So they gathered together to oppose Moses and Aaron .
NIRV	Numbers	20	3	They argued with Moses . They said , “ We wish we had died when our people fell dead in front of the Lord .
NIRV	Numbers	20	4	Why did you bring the Lord ’ s people into this desert ? We and our livestock will die here .

NIRV	Numbers	20	6	Moses and Aaron left the people . They went to the entrance to the tent of meeting . There they fell with their faces to the ground . Then the glory of the Lord appeared to them .
NIRV	Numbers	20	7	The Lord said to Moses ,
NIRV	Numbers	20	8	“ Get your walking stick . You and your brother Aaron gather the people together . Then speak to that rock while everyone is watching . It will pour out its water . You will bring water out of the rock for the community . Then they and their livestock can drink it. ”
NIRV	Numbers	20	9	So Moses took the walking stick from the tent . He did just as the Lord had commanded him .
NIRV	Numbers	20	10	He and Aaron gathered the people together in front of the rock . Moses said to them , “ Listen , you who refuse to obey ! Do we have to bring water out of this rock for you ? ”
NIRV	Numbers	20	11	Then Moses raised his arm . He hit the rock twice with his walking stick . Water poured out . And the people and their livestock drank it .
NIRV	Numbers	20	12	But the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron . He said , “ You did not trust in me enough to honor me . You did not honor me as the holy God in front of the Israelites . So you will not bring this community into the land I am giving them. ”

NIRV	Numbers	21	4	The Israelites traveled from Mount Hor along the way to the Red Sea . They wanted to go around Edom . But they grew tired on the way .
NIRV	Numbers	21	5	So they spoke against God and against Moses . They said , “ Why have you brought us up out of Egypt ? Do you want us to die here in the desert ? We don ’ t have any bread ! We don ’ t have any water ! And we hate this awful food ! ”
NIRV	Numbers	21	6	Then the Lord sent poisonous snakes among the Israelites . The snakes bit them . Many of the people died .
NIRV	Numbers	21	7	The others came to Moses . They said , “ We sinned when we spoke against the Lord and against you . Pray that the Lord will take the snakes away from us. ” So Moses prayed for the people .
NIRV	Numbers	21	8	The Lord said to Moses , “ Make a snake . Put it up on a pole . Then anyone who is bitten can look at it and remain alive. ”
NIRV	Numbers	21	9	So Moses made a bronze snake . He put it up on a pole . Then anyone who was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake remained alive . The People Continue On to Moab
NIRV	Numbers	21	10	The Israelites moved on . They camped at Oboth .
NIRV	Numbers	21	11	Then they started out from Oboth . They camped in Iye Abarim . It ’ s in the desert on the eastern border of Moab .
NIRV	Numbers	21	12	From there they moved on . They camped in the Zered Valley .
NIRV	Numbers	21	13	They started out from there and camped by the Arnon River . It ’ s in the desert that spreads out into the territory of the Amorites . The Arnon is the border of Moab . It ’ s between Moab and the Amorites .
NIRV	Numbers	21	14	Here is what the Book of the Wars of the Lord says about it . “ Sing about Zahab in Suphah and the valleys . Sing about the Arnon
NIRV	Numbers	21	15	and the slopes of the valleys . They lead to the settlement called Ar . They lie along the border of Moab. ”
NIRV	Numbers	21	16	From there the Israelites continued on to Beer . That was the well where the Lord spoke to Moses . He said , “ Gather the people together . I will give them water to drink. ”
NIRV	Numbers	21	17	Then Israel sang a song . They said , “ Spring up , you well ! Sing about it .
NIRV	Numbers	21	18	Sing about the well the princes dug . Sing about the well the nobles of the people dug . All their rulers were holding their scepters and walking sticks. ” Then the Israelites went from the desert to Mattanah .
NIRV	Numbers	21	19	They went from Mattanah to Nahaliel . They went from Nahaliel to Bamoth .
NIRV	Numbers	21	20	And they went from Bamoth to a valley in Moab . It ’ s the valley where the highest slopes of Pisgah look out over a dry and empty land . Israel Wins the Battle Over Sihon and Og

NIRV	Numbers	21	23	But Sihon wouldn ’ t let Israel pass through his territory . He gathered his whole army together . Then he marched out into the desert against Israel . When he reached Jahaz , he fought against Israel .
NIRV	Numbers	21	24	But Israel put him to death with their swords . They took over his land . They took everything from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River . But they didn ’ t take over any of the land of the Ammonites . That ’ s because the Ammonites had built strong forts along their border .
NIRV	Numbers	21	25	The Israelites captured all the cities of the Amorites . Then they settled down in them . They captured the city of Heshbon . They also captured all the settlements around it .
NIRV	Numbers	21	26	Sihon , the king of the Amorites , ruled in Heshbon . He had fought against an earlier king of Moab . Sihon had taken from him all his land all the way to the Arnon River .
NIRV	Numbers	21	27	That ’ s why the poets say , “ Come to Heshbon . Let it be built again . Let Sihon ’ s city be made as good as new .
NIRV	Numbers	21	28	“ Fire went out from Heshbon . A blaze went out from the city of Sihon . It burned up Ar in Moab . It burned up the citizens who lived on Arnon ’ s hills .
NIRV	Numbers	21	29	Moab , how terrible it is for you ! People of Chemosh , you are destroyed ! Chemosh has deserted his sons and daughters . His sons have run away from the battle . His daughters have become prisoners . He has handed all of them over to Sihon , the king of the Amorites .
NIRV	Numbers	21	30	“ But we have taken them over . Heshbon ’ s rule has been destroyed all the way to Dibon . We have destroyed them as far as Nophah . Nophah goes all the way to Medeba. ”

NIRV	Numbers	21	32	Moses sent spies to the city of Jazer . The Israelites captured the settlements around it . They drove out the Amorites who were there .
NIRV	Numbers	21	33	Then they turned and went up along the road toward Bashan . Og was the king of Bashan . He and his whole army marched out . They went to fight against Israel at Edrei .
NIRV	Numbers	21	34	The Lord said to Moses , “ Do not be afraid of Og . I have handed him over to you . I have given you his whole army . I have also given you his land . Do to him what you did to Sihon , the king of the Amorites . He ruled in Heshbon. ”

NIRV	Numbers	22	22	But God was very angry when Balaam went . So the angel of the Lord stood in the road to oppose him . Balaam was riding on his donkey . His two servants were with him .
NIRV	Numbers	22	2	Balak saw everything that Israel had done to the Amorites . Balak was the son of Zippor .
NIRV	Numbers	22	3	The Moabites were terrified because there were so many Israelites . In fact , the Moabites were filled with panic because of the Israelites .
NIRV	Numbers	22	4	The Moabites spoke to the elders of Midian . They said , “ This huge mob is going to destroy everything around us . They ’ ll lick it up as an ox licks up all the grass in the fields. ” Balak , the son of Zippor , was the king of Moab at that time .
NIRV	Numbers	22	5	He sent messengers to get Balaam . Balaam was the son of Beor . Balaam was at the city of Pethor near the Euphrates River . Pethor was in the land where Balaam had been born . Balak told the messengers to say to Balaam , “ A nation has come out of Egypt . They are covering the face of the land . They ’ ve set up camp next to me .
NIRV	Numbers	22	6	So come and put a curse on these people . They are too powerful for me . Maybe I ’ ll be able to win the battle over them . Maybe I ’ ll be able to drive them out of the land . I know that whoever you bless is blessed . And I know that whoever you cursed is cursed. ”
NIRV	Numbers	22	7	The elders of Moab and Midian left . They took with them the money they knew Balaam would ask for . They wanted him to use evil magic to figure things out for them . They came to where Balaam was . And they told him what Balak had said .
NIRV	Numbers	22	8	“ Spend the night here , ” Balaam said to them . “ I ’ ll report back to you with the answer the Lord gives me. ” So the Moabite officials stayed with him .
NIRV	Numbers	22	9	God came to Balaam . He asked , “ Who are these men with you ? ”
NIRV	Numbers	22	10	Balaam said to God , “ Balak king of Moab , the son of Zippor , sent me a message .
NIRV	Numbers	22	11	He said , ‘ A nation has come out of Egypt . They are covering the whole surface of the land . So come and put a curse on them for me . Maybe I ’ ll be able to fight them . Maybe I ’ ll be able to drive them away. ’ ”
NIRV	Numbers	22	12	But God said to Balaam , “ Do not go with them . You must not put a curse on those people . I have blessed them. ”
NIRV	Numbers	22	13	The next morning Balaam got up . He said to Balak ’ s officials , “ Go back to your own country . The Lord won ’ t let me go with you. ”
NIRV	Numbers	22	14	So the Moabite officials returned to Balak . They said , “ Balaam wouldn ’ t come with us. ”
NIRV	Numbers	22	15	Then Balak sent other officials . They were more important than the first ones . And there were more of them .
NIRV	Numbers	22	16	They came to Balaam . They said , “ Balak , the son of Zippor , says , ‘ Don ’ t let anything keep you from coming to me .
NIRV	Numbers	22	17	I ’ ll make you very rich . I ’ ll do anything you say . So come and put a curse on those people for me. ’ ”
NIRV	Numbers	22	18	But Balaam gave them his answer . He said , “ Balak could give me all the silver and gold in his palace . Even then , I still couldn ’ t do anything at all that goes beyond what the Lord my God commands .
NIRV	Numbers	22	19	Now spend the night here so that I can find out what else the Lord will tell me. ”
NIRV	Numbers	22	20	That night God came to Balaam . He said , “ These men have come to get you . So go with them . But do only what I tell you to do. ” Balaam ’ s Donkey
NIRV	Numbers	22	21	Balaam got up in the morning . He put a saddle on his donkey . Then he went with the Moabite officials .
NIRV	Numbers	22	23	The donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road . The angel was holding a sword . He was ready for battle . So the donkey left the road and went into a field . Balaam hit the donkey . He wanted to get it back on the road .
NIRV	Numbers	22	24	Then the angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path . The path went through the vineyards . There were walls on both sides .
NIRV	Numbers	22	25	The donkey saw the angel of the Lord . So it moved close to the wall . It crushed Balaam ’ s foot against the wall . So he hit the donkey again .
NIRV	Numbers	22	26	Then the angel of the Lord moved on ahead . He stood in a narrow place . There was no room to turn , either right or left .
NIRV	Numbers	22	27	The donkey saw the angel of the Lord . So it lay down under Balaam . That made him angry . He hit the donkey with his walking stick .
NIRV	Numbers	22	28	Then the Lord opened the donkey ’ s mouth . It said to Balaam , “ What have I done to you ? Why did you hit me these three times ? ”
NIRV	Numbers	22	29	Balaam answered the donkey . He said , “ You have made me look foolish ! I wish I had a sword in my hand . If I did , I ’ d kill you right now. ”
NIRV	Numbers	22	30	The donkey said to Balaam , “ I ’ m your own donkey . I ’ m the one you have always ridden . Haven ’ t you been riding me to this very day ? Have I ever made you look foolish before ? ” “ No , ” he said .
NIRV	Numbers	22	31	Then the Lord opened Balaam ’ s eyes . He saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road . He saw that the angel was holding a sword . The angel was ready for battle . So Balaam bowed down . He fell with his face to the ground .
NIRV	Numbers	22	32	The angel of the Lord spoke to him . He asked him , “ Why have you hit your donkey three times ? I have come here to oppose you . What you are doing is foolish .
NIRV	Numbers	22	33	The donkey saw me . It turned away from me three times . Suppose it had not turned away . Then I would certainly have killed you by now . But I would have spared the donkey. ”
NIRV	Numbers	22	34	Balaam said to the angel of the Lord , “ I have sinned . I didn ’ t realize you were standing in the road to oppose me . Tell me whether you are pleased with me . If you aren ’ t , I ’ ll go back. ”
NIRV	Numbers	22	35	The angel of the Lord said to Balaam , “ Go with the men . But say only what I tell you to say. ” So Balaam went with Balak ’ s officials .
NIRV	Numbers	22	36	Balak heard that Balaam was coming . So he went out to meet him . They met at a Moabite town near the Arnon River . The town was on the border of Balak ’ s territory .
NIRV	Numbers	22	37	Balak said to Balaam , “ Didn ’ t I send messengers to you ? I wanted you to come quickly . So why didn ’ t you come ? I can make you very rich. ”
NIRV	Numbers	22	38	“ Well , I ’ ve come to you now , ” Balaam replied . “ But I can ’ t say whatever I please . I can only speak the words God puts in my mouth. ”
NIRV	Numbers	22	39	Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth .
NIRV	Numbers	22	40	Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep . He gave some to Balaam . He also gave some to the officials with him .
NIRV	Numbers	22	41	The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal . From there he could see the outer edges of the Israelite camp . Copyright ©

NIRV	Numbers	23	23	There isn ’ t any magic that can hurt the people of Jacob . No one can use magic words to harm Israel . Here is what will be said about the people of Jacob . Here is what will be said about Israel . People will say , ‘ See what God has done ! ’
NIRV	Numbers	23	2	Balak did just as Balaam said . The two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar .
NIRV	Numbers	23	3	Then Balaam said to Balak , “ Stay here beside your offering . I ’ ll go and try to find out what the Lord wants me to do . Maybe he ’ ll come and meet with me . Then I ’ ll tell you what he says to me. ” So Balaam went off to a bare hilltop .
NIRV	Numbers	23	4	God met with him there . Balaam said , “ I ’ ve prepared seven altars . On each altar I ’ ve offered a bull and a ram. ”
NIRV	Numbers	23	5	The Lord put a message in Balaam ’ s mouth . The Lord said , “ Go back to Balak . Give him my message. ”
NIRV	Numbers	23	6	So Balaam went back to him . He found Balak standing beside his offering . All the Moabite officials were with him .
NIRV	Numbers	23	7	Then Balaam spoke the message he had received from God . He said , “ Balak brought me from the land of Aram . The king of Moab sent for me from the mountains in the east . ‘ Come , ’ he said . ‘ Put a curse on Jacob ’ s people for me . Come . Speak against Israel. ’
NIRV	Numbers	23	8	But how can I put a curse on people God hasn ’ t cursed ? How can I speak against people the Lord hasn ’ t spoken against ?
NIRV	Numbers	23	9	I see them from the rocky peaks . I view them from the hills . I see a group of people who live by themselves . They don ’ t consider themselves to be one of the nations .
NIRV	Numbers	23	10	Jacob ’ s people are like the dust of the earth . Can dust be counted ? Who can count even a fourth of the Israelites ? Let me die as godly people die . Let my death be like theirs ! ”
NIRV	Numbers	23	11	Balak said to Balaam , “ What have you done to me ? I brought you here to put a curse on my enemies ! But all you have done is give them a blessing ! ”
NIRV	Numbers	23	12	He answered , “ I have to speak only the words the Lord puts in my mouth. ” Balaam ’ s Second Message From God
NIRV	Numbers	23	13	Then Balak said to Balaam , “ Come with me to another place . You can see the Israelites from there . You won ’ t see all of them . You will only see the outer edges of their camp . From there , put a curse on them for me. ”
NIRV	Numbers	23	14	So Balak took Balaam to the field of Zophim . It was on the highest slopes of Pisgah . There Balak built seven altars . He offered a bull and a ram on each altar .
NIRV	Numbers	23	15	Balaam said to Balak , “ Stay here beside your offering . I ’ ll meet with the Lord over there. ”
NIRV	Numbers	23	16	The Lord met with Balaam . He put a message in Balaam ’ s mouth . The Lord said , “ Go back to Balak . Give him my message. ”
NIRV	Numbers	23	17	So Balaam went to Balak . He found him standing beside his offering . The Moabite officials were with him . Balak asked him , “ What did the Lord say ? ”
NIRV	Numbers	23	18	Then Balaam spoke the message he had received from God . He said , “ Balak , rise up and listen . Son of Zippor , hear me .
NIRV	Numbers	23	19	God isn ’ t a mere human . He can ’ t lie . He isn ’ t a human being . He doesn ’ t change his mind . He speaks , and then he acts . He makes a promise , and then he keeps it .
NIRV	Numbers	23	20	He has commanded me to bless Israel . He has given them his blessing . And I can ’ t change it .
NIRV	Numbers	23	21	“ I don ’ t see any trouble coming on the people of Jacob . I don ’ t see any suffering in Israel . The Lord their God is with them . The shout of the King is among them .
NIRV	Numbers	23	22	God brought them out of Egypt . They are as strong as a wild ox .
NIRV	Numbers	23	24	The Israelites are going to wake up like a female lion . They are going to get up like a male lion . They are like a lion that won ’ t rest until it eats what it has caught . They are like a lion that won ’ t rest until it drinks the blood of what it has killed. ”
NIRV	Numbers	23	25	Then Balak said to Balaam , “ Don ’ t put a curse on them at all ! And don ’ t give them a blessing at all ! ”
NIRV	Numbers	23	26	Balaam answered , “ Didn ’ t I tell you that I must do only what the Lord says ? ” Balaam ’ s Third Message From God
NIRV	Numbers	23	27	Then Balak said to Balaam , “ Come . Let me take you to another place . Perhaps God will be pleased to let you put a curse on the Israelites for me from there. ”
NIRV	Numbers	23	28	Balak took Balaam to the top of Mount Peor . It looks out over a dry and empty land .
NIRV	Numbers	23	29	Balaam said , “ Build me seven altars here . Prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me to sacrifice. ”

NIRV	Numbers	24	24	Ships will come from the shores of Cyprus . They will bring Ashur and Eber under their control . But they themselves will also be destroyed. ”
NIRV	Numbers	24	2	He looked out and saw Israel . They had set up their camps tribe by tribe . The Spirit of God came on him .
NIRV	Numbers	24	3	Balaam spoke the message he had received from God . He said , “ Here is the message God gave Balaam , the son of Beor . It ’ s the message God gave to the one who sees clearly .

NIRV	Numbers	24	9	Like a male lion they lie down and sleep . They are like a female lion . Who dares to wake them up ? “ May those who bless you be blessed ! May those who curse you be cursed ! ”
NIRV	Numbers	24	10	Then Balak became very angry with Balaam . He slapped his hands together . He said to Balaam , “ I sent for you to put a curse on my enemies . But you have given them a blessing three times .
NIRV	Numbers	24	11	Get out of here right away ! Go home ! I said I ’ d make you very rich . But the Lord has kept you from getting rich. ”
NIRV	Numbers	24	12	Balaam answered Balak , “ Here is what I told the messengers you sent me .
NIRV	Numbers	24	13	I said , ‘ Balak could give me all the silver and gold in his palace . Even if I wanted to , I still couldn ’ t do anything at all that goes beyond what the Lord commands . I must say only what the Lord tells me to say. ’

NIRV	Numbers	25	25	Israel was staying in Shittim . The men of Israel began to commit sexual sins with the women of Moab .
NIRV	Numbers	25	2	The women invited the men to feasts and sacrifices to honor their gods . The people ate the sacrifices and bowed down in front of the statues of those gods .
NIRV	Numbers	25	3	So Israel joined in worshiping the god named Baal that was worshiped at Peor . The Lord became very angry with Israel .
NIRV	Numbers	25	4	The Lord said to Moses , “ Take all the leaders of these people . Kill them . Put their dead bodies out in the open . I want to see you do it in the middle of the day . Then I will not be angry with Israel. ”
NIRV	Numbers	25	5	So Moses spoke to Israel ’ s judges . He said , “ Some of your people have joined in worshiping the god named Baal that is worshiped at Peor . Each of you must kill the people in your tribe who have done that. ”
NIRV	Numbers	25	6	Then an Israelite man brought into the camp a Midianite woman . He did it right in front of the eyes of Moses and the whole community of Israel . They were weeping at the entrance to the tent of meeting .
NIRV	Numbers	25	7	Phinehas was a priest . He was the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron . When Phinehas saw what had happened , he left the people . He took a spear in his hand .
NIRV	Numbers	25	8	He followed the man into the tent . Phinehas stuck the spear through the man and into the woman ’ s stomach . Then the Lord stopped the plague against the Israelites .
NIRV	Numbers	25	9	But the plague had already killed 24,000 of them .
NIRV	Numbers	25	10	The Lord said to Moses ,
NIRV	Numbers	25	11	“ Phinehas is a priest . He is the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron . Phinehas has turned my anger away from the Israelites . I am committed to making sure I am honored among them . And he is as committed as I am . So even though I was angry with them , I did not put an end to them .
NIRV	Numbers	25	12	So tell Phinehas I am making my covenant with him . It is my promise to give him peace .
NIRV	Numbers	25	13	He and his sons after him will have a covenant to be priests forever . That is because he was committed to making sure that I , his God , was honored . In that way he paid for the sin of the Israelites. ”
NIRV	Numbers	25	14	The name of the Israelite man who was killed was Zimri . He was the son of Salu . Zimri was killed along with the Midianite woman . Salu was a family leader in the tribe of Simeon .
NIRV	Numbers	25	15	The name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Kozbi . She was the daughter of Zur . He was the chief of a Midianite family .
NIRV	Numbers	25	16	The Lord spoke to Moses . He said ,
NIRV	Numbers	25	17	“ Treat the Midianites just as you would treat enemies . Kill them .
NIRV	Numbers	25	18	After all , they treated you like enemies . They tricked you into worshiping the god named Baal that is worshiped at Peor . They also tricked you because of what Kozbi did .

NIRV	Numbers	31	25	The Lord spoke to Moses . He said ,
NIRV	Numbers	31	26	“ Here is what you and Eleazar the priest and the family leaders of the community must do . You must count all the people and animals you captured .
NIRV	Numbers	31	27	Divide up some of what you took with the soldiers who fought in the battle . Divide up the rest with the others in the community .
NIRV	Numbers	31	28	Set apart a gift for me . Take something from the soldiers who fought in the battle . Set apart one out of every
NIRV	Numbers	31	500	people , cattle , donkeys or sheep .
NIRV	Numbers	31	29	Take my gift from the soldiers ’ half . Give it to Eleazar the priest . It is my share .

NIRV	Numbers	32	32	We ’ ll get ready for battle . We ’ ll go across the Jordan into Canaan . We ’ ll fight for the Lord there . But the property we receive will be on this side of the Jordan River. ”
NIRV	Numbers	32	2	So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest . They also came to the leaders of the community . They said ,
NIRV	Numbers	32	3	“ We have seen the cities of Ataroth , Dibon , Jazer , Nimrah and Heshbon . We ’ ve seen Elealeh , Sebam , Nebo and Beon .
NIRV	Numbers	32	4	All of them are in the land the Lord has brought under Israel ’ s control . This land is just right for livestock . And we have livestock .
NIRV	Numbers	32	5	We hope you are pleased with us , ” they continued . “ If you are , please give us this land . Then it will belong to us . But don ’ t make us go across the Jordan River. ”
NIRV	Numbers	32	6	Moses spoke to the people of Gad and Reuben . He said , “ Should the rest of us go to war while you stay here ?
NIRV	Numbers	32	7	The Lord has given the land of Canaan to the Israelites . So why would you want to keep them from going over into it ?
NIRV	Numbers	32	8	That ’ s what your fathers did . I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to check out the land .
NIRV	Numbers	32	9	They went up to the Valley of Eshkol and looked at the land . Then they talked the Israelites out of entering the land the Lord had given them .
NIRV	Numbers	32	10	The Lord ’ s anger was stirred up that day . So he made a promise . He said ,
NIRV	Numbers	32	11	‘ Not one of those who were
NIRV	Numbers	32	20	Then Moses said to them , “ Do what you have promised to do . Get ready to fight for the Lord .
NIRV	Numbers	32	12	But not one of the people who came up out of Egypt will see the land except Caleb and Joshua . Caleb is the son of Jephunneh , the Kenizzite . And Joshua is the son of Nun . They will see the land . They followed the Lord with their whole heart. ’
NIRV	Numbers	32	13	The Lord became very angry with Israel . He made them wander around in the desert for
NIRV	Numbers	32	40	So Moses gave Gilead to the people of Makir , the son of Manasseh . And they settled there .
NIRV	Numbers	32	14	“ Now here you are , you bunch of sinners ! You have taken the place of your fathers . And you are making the Lord even angrier with Israel .
NIRV	Numbers	32	15	What if you turn away from following him ? Then he ’ ll leave all these people in the desert again . And it will be your fault when they are destroyed. ”
NIRV	Numbers	32	16	Then they came up to Moses . They said , “ We would like to build pens here for our livestock . We would also like to build cities for our women and children .
NIRV	Numbers	32	17	But we will prepare ourselves for battle . We ’ re even ready to go ahead of the Israelites . We ’ ll march out with them until we ’ ve brought them to their place . While we ’ re gone , our women and children will live in cities that have high walls around them . That will keep them safe from the people living in this land .
NIRV	Numbers	32	18	We won ’ t return to our homes until each of the Israelites has received their share of the land .
NIRV	Numbers	32	19	We won ’ t receive any share with them on the west side of the Jordan River . We ’ ve already received our share here on the east side. ”
NIRV	Numbers	32	21	Prepare yourselves and go across the Jordan River . Fight for the Lord until he has driven out his enemies in front of him .
NIRV	Numbers	32	22	When the land is under the Lord ’ s control , you can come back here . Your duty to the Lord and Israel will be over . Then the Lord will give you this land as your own .
NIRV	Numbers	32	23	“ But what if you fail to do your duty ? Then you will be sinning against the Lord . And you may be sure that your sin will be discovered . It will be brought out into the open .
NIRV	Numbers	32	24	So build up cities for your women and children . Make sheep pens for your flocks . But do what you have promised to do. ”
NIRV	Numbers	32	25	The people of Gad and Reuben spoke to Moses . They said , “ We will do just as you command .
NIRV	Numbers	32	26	Our children and wives will remain here in the cities of Gilead . So will our flocks and herds .
NIRV	Numbers	32	27	But we will prepare ourselves for battle . We ’ ll go across the Jordan River and fight for the Lord . We will do just as you have said. ”
NIRV	Numbers	32	28	Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest . He gave the same orders to Joshua , the son of Nun . He also spoke to the family leaders of the Israelite tribes .
NIRV	Numbers	32	29	He said , “ The men of Gad and Reuben must get ready for battle . They must go across the Jordan River with you . They must help you fight for the Lord . They must stay with you until the land has been brought under your control . If they do , you must give them the land of Gilead as their own .
NIRV	Numbers	32	30	But what if they don ’ t get ready for battle ? What if they don ’ t go across the Jordan with you ? Then they must accept a share with you in Canaan. ”
NIRV	Numbers	32	31	The people of Gad and Reuben gave their answer . They said , “ We will do what the Lord has said .
NIRV	Numbers	32	33	Then Moses gave their land to them . He gave it to the tribes of Gad and Reuben and half of the tribe of Manasseh . Manasseh was Joseph ’ s son . One part of that land had belonged to the kingdom of Sihon . He was the king of the Amorites . The other part had belonged to the kingdom of Og . He was the king of Bashan . Moses gave that whole land to those two and a half tribes . It included its cities and the territory around them .

NIRV	Numbers	35	35	On the plains of Moab , the Lord spoke to Moses . It was by the Jordan River across from Jericho . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Numbers	35	2	“ Command the Israelites to give the Levites towns to live in . The towns must come from the shares of land the people will have as their own . Also give the Levites the grasslands around the towns .
NIRV	Numbers	35	3	Then the Levites will have towns to live in . They will also have grasslands for their cattle and all their other livestock .
NIRV	Numbers	35	4	“ The grasslands around each town you give them will go out to 1,500 feet from the town wall .
NIRV	Numbers	35	5	Outside each town , the east side will measure 3,000 feet . So will the south side , the west side and the north side . The town must be in the center . And the Levites will own the grasslands around each town . Cities to Run to for Safety
NIRV	Numbers	35	6	“ Six of the towns you give the Levites will be cities to go to for safety . A person who has killed someone can run to one of them . Also give the Levites
NIRV	Numbers	35	42	other towns .
NIRV	Numbers	35	7	You must give the Levites a total of
NIRV	Numbers	35	48	towns . Also give them the grasslands around those towns .
NIRV	Numbers	35	8	The towns you give the Levites must come from the land the Israelites have as their own . So the number you give from each tribe will depend on the size of that tribe ’ s share . Take many towns from a tribe that has many towns . But take only a few towns from a tribe that has only a few. ”
NIRV	Numbers	35	9	Then the Lord said to Moses ,
NIRV	Numbers	35	10	“ Speak to the Israelites . Tell them , ‘ You will soon go across the Jordan River . You will enter Canaan .
NIRV	Numbers	35	11	When you do , choose the cities to go to for safety . People who have killed someone by accident can run to one of those cities .
NIRV	Numbers	35	12	They will be places of safety for them . People will be safe there from those who want to kill them . Then anyone charged with murder will not die before their case has been brought to the community court .
NIRV	Numbers	35	13	Six towns will be the cities you can go to for safety .
NIRV	Numbers	35	14	Three will be east of the Jordan River . The other three will be in Canaan .
NIRV	Numbers	35	15	Those six towns will be places where the Israelites can go for safety . Outsiders living in Israel can also go to them for safety . So anyone who has killed another person by accident can run there .
NIRV	Numbers	35	16	“ ‘ Suppose a person uses an iron object to hit and kill someone . Then that person is a murderer and must be put to death .
NIRV	Numbers	35	17	Or suppose a person is holding a stone that could kill . And they use it to hit and kill someone . Then that person is a murderer and must be put to death .
NIRV	Numbers	35	18	Or suppose a person is holding a wooden object that could kill . And they use it to hit and kill someone . Then that person is a murderer and must be put to death .
NIRV	Numbers	35	19	The dead person ’ s nearest male relative must kill the murderer . When he meets up with him , he must kill the murderer .
NIRV	Numbers	35	20	What if a person makes evil plans against someone else ? And what if that person pushes them so that they die ? Or what if that person throws something at them so that they die ?
NIRV	Numbers	35	21	Or what if that person hits another person with a fist so that the other dies ? Then the person who does any of those things must be put to death . That person is a murderer . The dead person ’ s nearest male relative must kill the murderer . When he meets up with him , he must kill the murderer .
NIRV	Numbers	35	22	“ ‘ But what if a person suddenly pushes someone else without being angry ? Or what if that person throws something at someone else without meaning to ?
NIRV	Numbers	35	23	Or what if that person does not see the other person and drops a stone on them that kills them ? He was not the dead person ’ s enemy . He did not mean to harm them .
NIRV	Numbers	35	24	Then the court must decide between the person who did the act and the nearest male relative of the one who was killed . Here are the rules the court must follow .
NIRV	Numbers	35	25	The court must provide a safe place for the person accused of murder . It must keep the one accused of murder safe from those who want to kill them . The court must send the accused person back to the city they ran to for safety . The accused person must stay there until the high priest dies . That priest has been anointed with holy oil .
NIRV	Numbers	35	26	“ ‘ But suppose the accused person goes outside that city .
NIRV	Numbers	35	27	And suppose the dead person ’ s nearest male relative finds them outside the city . Then the relative can kill the accused person . The relative will not be guilty of murder .
NIRV	Numbers	35	28	The accused person must stay in that city until the high priest dies . Only then may they return home .
NIRV	Numbers	35	29	“ ‘ This is what the law requires of you for all time to come . It will apply to you no matter where you live .
NIRV	Numbers	35	30	“ ‘ Suppose a person kills someone . Then that person must be put to death as a murderer . But do it only when there are witnesses who can tell what happened . Do not put anyone to death if only one witness tells what happened .
NIRV	Numbers	35	31	“ ‘ Do not accept payment for a murderer ’ s life . A murderer deserves to die . They must certainly be put to death .
NIRV	Numbers	35	32	“ ‘ Do not accept payment for anyone who has run to a city for safety . Do not let them buy their freedom to return home . They must not go back and live on their own land before the high priest dies .
NIRV	Numbers	35	33	“ ‘ Do not pollute the land where you are . Murder pollutes the land . Only one thing can pay to remove the pollution in the land where murder has been committed . The blood of the one who spilled another ’ s blood must be spilled .
NIRV	Numbers	35	34	So do not make the land where you live “ unclean , ” because I live there too . I , the Lord , live among the Israelites. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Numbers	36	36	The heads of the families of Gilead came to Moses . Gilead was the son of Makir . The family heads were from the tribe of Manasseh . So they were in the family line of Joseph . They spoke to Moses in front of the leaders of the families of Israel .
NIRV	Numbers	36	2	They said , “ The Lord commanded you to give shares of the land to the Israelites . He told you to cast lots when you do it . At that time the Lord ordered you to give our brother Zelophehad ’ s share to his daughters .
NIRV	Numbers	36	3	Suppose they marry men from other tribes in Israel . Then their share will be taken away from our family ’ s land . It will be added to the land of the tribe they marry into . So a part of the share given to us will be taken away .
NIRV	Numbers	36	4	The Year of Jubilee for the Israelites will come . Then their share will be added to the land of the tribe they marry into . Their land will be taken away from the share given to our tribe. ”
NIRV	Numbers	36	5	Then the Lord gave a command to Moses . He told Moses to give an order to the Israelites . Moses said , “ What the tribe in the family line of Joseph is saying is right .
NIRV	Numbers	36	6	Here is what the Lord commands for Zelophehad ’ s daughters . They can marry anyone they want to . But they have to marry someone in their own family ’ s tribe .
NIRV	Numbers	36	7	Property in Israel must not pass from one tribe to another . Everyone in Israel must keep their family ’ s share of their tribe ’ s land .
NIRV	Numbers	36	8	Suppose a daughter in any tribe of Israel receives land from her parents . Then she must marry someone in her father ’ s family and tribe . In that way , every family ’ s share will remain in its family line in Israel .
NIRV	Numbers	36	9	Property can ’ t pass from one tribe to another . Each tribe of Israel must keep the land it receives. ”
NIRV	Numbers	36	10	So Zelophehad ’ s daughters did just as the Lord commanded Moses .
NIRV	Numbers	36	11	The names of the daughters were Mahlah , Tirzah , Hoglah , Milkah and Noah . All of them married their cousins on their father ’ s side .
NIRV	Numbers	36	12	They married men in the family line of Manasseh , the son of Joseph . So the land they received remained in their father ’ s family and tribe .
NIRV	Numbers	36	13	These are the commands and rules the Lord gave through Moses . He gave them to the Israelites on the plains of Moab . They were by the Jordan River across from Jericho . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	1	These are the words Moses spoke to all the Israelites . At that time , they were in the desert east of the Jordan River . It ’ s in the Arabah Valley across from Suph . The people were between Paran and Tophel , Laban , Hazeroth and Dizahab .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	2	It takes
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	11	The Lord is the God of your people . May he cause there to be a thousand times more of you . May he bless you , just as he promised he would .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	3	It was the 40th year since the Israelites had left Egypt . On the first day of the 11th month , Moses spoke to them . He told them everything the Lord had commanded him to tell them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	4	They had already won the battle over Sihon . Sihon was the king of the Amorites . He had ruled in Heshbon . Israel had also won the battle over Og at Edrei . Og was the king of Bashan . He had ruled in Ashtaroth .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	5	The people were east of the Jordan River in the territory of Moab . There Moses began to explain the law . Here is what he said .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	6	The Lord our God spoke to us at Mount Horeb . He said , “ You have stayed long enough at this mountain .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	7	Take your tents down . Go into the hill country of the Amorites . Go to all the people who are their neighbors . Go to the people who live in the Arabah Valley . Travel to the mountains and the western hills . Go to the people in the Negev Desert and along the coast . Travel to the land of Canaan and to Lebanon . Go as far as the great Euphrates River .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	8	I have given you all this land . Go in and take it as your own . The Lord promised he would give the land to your fathers . He promised it to Abraham , Isaac and Jacob . He also said he would give it to their children after them. ” Some Officials Are Chosen to Help Moses
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	9	At that time I spoke to you . I said , “ You are too heavy a load for me to carry alone .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	10	The Lord your God has caused there to be many of you . Today you are as many as the stars in the sky .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	12	of you . I picked one man from each tribe .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	13	So choose some wise men from each of your tribes . They must understand how to give good advice . The people must have respect for them . I will appoint those men to have authority over you. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	14	You answered me , “ Your suggestion is good. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	15	So I chose the leading men of your tribes who were wise and respected . I appointed them to have authority over you . I made them commanders of thousands , hundreds , fifties and tens . I appointed them to be officials over the tribes .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	16	Here is what I commanded your judges at that time . I said , “ Listen to your people ’ s cases when they argue with one another . Judge them fairly . It doesn ’ t matter whether the case is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and an outsider living among you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	17	When you judge them , treat everyone the same . Listen to those who are important and those who are not . Don ’ t be afraid of anyone . God is the highest judge . Bring me any case that is too hard for you . I ’ ll listen to it. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	18	At that time I told you everything you should do . Twelve Men Check Out the Land of Canaan
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	19	The Lord our God commanded us to start out from Mount Horeb . So we did . We went toward the hill country of the Amorites . We traveled all through the huge and terrible desert you saw . Finally , we reached Kadesh Barnea .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	20	Then I said to you , “ You have reached the hill country of the Amorites . The Lord our God is giving it to us .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	21	The Lord your God has given you the land . Go up and take it . Do what the Lord says . He ’ s the God of your people . Don ’ t be afraid . Don ’ t lose hope. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	22	Then all of you came to me . You said , “ Let ’ s send some men ahead of us . They can check out the land for us and bring back a report . They can suggest to us which way to go . They can tell us about the towns we ’ ll come to. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	23	That seemed like a good idea to me . So I chose
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	24	They left and went up into the hill country . There they came to the Valley of Eshkol . They checked it out .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	25	They got some of the fruit of that land . Then they brought it down to us and gave us their report . They said , “ The Lord our God is giving us a good land. ” Israel Refuses to Obey the Lord
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	26	But you wouldn ’ t go up . You refused to obey the command of the Lord your God .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	27	You spoke against him in your tents . You said , “ The Lord hates us . That ’ s why he brought us out of Egypt to hand us over to the Amorites . He wanted to destroy us .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	28	Where can we go ? The men who checked out the land have made us afraid . They say , ‘ The people are stronger and taller than we are . The cities are large . They have walls that reach up to the sky . We even saw the Anakites there. ’ ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	29	Then I said to you , “ Don ’ t be terrified . Don ’ t be afraid of them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	30	The Lord your God will go ahead of you . He will fight for you . With your own eyes you saw how he fought for you in Egypt .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	31	You also saw how the Lord your God brought you through the desert . He carried you everywhere you went , just as a father carries his son . And now you have arrived here. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	32	In spite of that , you didn ’ t trust in the Lord your God .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	33	He went ahead of you on your journey . He was in the fire at night and in the cloud during the day . He found places for you to camp . He showed you the way you should go .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	34	The Lord heard what you said . So he became angry . He made a promise . He said ,
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	35	“ I promised to give this good land to your people of long ago . But no one alive today will see it .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	36	Only Caleb will see the land . He is the son of Jephunneh . I will give him and his children after him the land he walked on . He followed me with his whole heart. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	37	Because of you , the Lord became angry with me also . He said , “ You will not enter the land either .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	38	But Joshua , the son of Nun , is your helper . Joshua will enter the land . Help him to be brave . Give him hope . He will lead Israel to take the land as their own .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	39	You said your little ones would be taken prisoner . But they will enter the land . They do not yet know right from wrong . But I will give them the land . They will take it as their own .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	40	As for you , turn around . Start out toward the desert . Go along the road that leads to the Red Sea. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	41	Then you replied , “ We have sinned against the Lord . We will go up and fight . We ’ ll do just as the Lord our God has commanded us. ” So all of you got your swords and put them on . You thought it would be easy to go up into the hill country .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	42	But the Lord spoke to me . He said , “ Tell them , ‘ Do not go up and fight . I will not be with you . Your enemies will win the battle over you. ’ ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	43	So I told you what the Lord said . But you wouldn ’ t listen . You refused to obey his command . You were so filled with pride that you marched up into the hill country .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	44	The Amorites who lived in those hills came out and attacked you . Like large numbers of bees they chased you . They beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	45	You came back and wept in front of the Lord . But he didn ’ t pay any attention to your weeping . He wouldn ’ t listen to you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	1	46	So you stayed in Kadesh for many years . You spent a long time in that area . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	2	Then the Lord spoke to me . He said ,
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	3	“ You have made your way around this hill country long enough . So now turn north .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	4	Here are the orders I want you to give the people . Tell them , ‘ You are about to pass through the territory of your relatives . They are from the family line of Esau . They live in Seir . They will be afraid of you . But be very careful .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	5	Do not make them angry . If you do , they will go to war against you . I will not give you any of their land . You will not have even enough to put your foot on . I have given Esau ’ s people the hill country of Seir as their own .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	6	Pay them with silver for the food you eat and the water you drink. ’ ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	7	The Lord your God has blessed you in everything your hands have done . He watched over you when you traveled through that huge desert . For these
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	40	years the Lord your God has been with you . So you have had everything you need .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	8	We went on past our relatives . They are from the family line of Esau . They live in Seir . We turned away from the Arabah Valley road . It comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber . We traveled along the desert road of Moab .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	9	Then the Lord said to me , “ Do not attack the Moabites . Do not even make them angry . If you do , they will go to war against you . I will not give you any part of their land . I have given Moab to the people in the family line of Lot . I have given it to them as their own. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	10	The Emites used to live there . They were strong people . There were large numbers of them . They were as tall as the Anakites .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	11	Like the Anakites , they too were thought of as Rephaites . But the Moabites called them Emites .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	12	The Horites used to live in Seir . But the people of Esau drove them out . They destroyed the Horites to make room for themselves . Then they settled in their territory . They did just as Israel has done in the land the Lord gave them as their own .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	13	The Lord said , “ Now get up . Go across the Zered Valley. ” So we went across it .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	14	Between the time we left Kadesh Barnea and the time we went across the Zered Valley ,
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	38	years had passed . By then , all the fighting men who had been in our camp from the beginning had died . The Lord had warned them that it would happen .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	15	He used his power against them until he had gotten rid of all of them . Not one was left in the camp .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	16	Finally , the last of the fighting men among the people died .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	17	Then the Lord said to me ,
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	18	“ Today you must pass near the border of Moab . Moab is also called Ar .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	19	When you come to the Ammonites , do not attack them . Do not make them angry . If you do , they will go to war against you . I will not give you any of their land as your own . I have given it to the people in the family line of Lot . I have given it to them as their own. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	20	That land was also thought of as a land of the Rephaites . They used to live there . But the Ammonites called them Zamzummites .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	21	The Rephaites were strong people . There were large numbers of them . They were as tall as the Anakites . The Lord destroyed the Rephaites to make room for the Ammonites . So the Ammonites drove them out . Then they settled in the territory of the Rephaites .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	22	The Lord had done the same thing for the people of Esau . They lived in Seir . The Lord destroyed the Horites to make room for Esau ’ s people . They drove the Horites out . So the people of Esau have lived in Seir in the territory of the Horites to this very day .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	23	The Avvites lived in villages as far away as Gaza . But people came from Crete and destroyed the Avvites . Then the people of Crete made their home in the territory of the Avvites . Israel Wins the Battle Over Sihon
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	24	The Lord said , “ Start out and go across the valley of the Arnon River . I have handed Sihon over to you . He is the Amorite king of Heshbon . I have also given you his country . Begin to take it as your own . Go to war against him .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	25	This very day I will bring fear and terror on all the nations because of you . They will hear about you . They will tremble with fear . Pain and suffering will grip them because of you. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	26	I sent messengers from the Desert of Kedemoth . I told them to go to Sihon , the king of Heshbon . They offered him peace . They said ,
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	27	“ Let us pass through your country . We ’ ll stay on the main road . We won ’ t turn off it to one side or the other .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	28	We ’ ll pay you the right amount of silver for food to eat and water to drink . Just let us walk through your country .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	29	The people of Esau , who live in Seir , allowed us to do that . The people of Moab , who live in Ar , also allowed us to do it . So let us walk through until we go across the Jordan River . Then we ’ ll be able to go into the land the Lord our God is giving us. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	30	But Sihon , the king of Heshbon , refused to let us walk through . The Lord your God had made him stubborn in his heart and spirit . The Lord wanted to hand him over to you . And that ’ s exactly what he has done .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	31	The Lord said to me , “ I have begun to hand Sihon and his country over to you . So begin the battle to take his land as your own. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	32	Sihon and his whole army came out to fight against us at Jahaz .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	33	But the Lord our God handed him over to us . We struck him down together with his sons and his whole army .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	34	At that time we took all his towns . We completely destroyed them . We killed all the men , women and children . We didn ’ t leave any of them alive .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	35	But we took for ourselves the livestock and everything else from the towns we had captured .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	36	Not a single town was too strong for us . That includes all the towns from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon River valley all the way to Gilead . It also includes the town in the valley . The Lord our God gave us all of them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	2	37	And you obeyed the Lord ’ s command . You didn ’ t go near any part of the land of the Ammonites . That includes the land along the Jabbok River . It also includes the land around the towns in the hills . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	3	So the Lord our God also handed Og , the king of Bashan , and his whole army over to us . We struck them down . We didn ’ t leave any of them alive .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	2	The Lord said to me , “ Do not be afraid of Og . I have handed him over to you . I have also handed over his whole army and his land . Do to him what you did to Sihon . Sihon was the Amorite king who ruled in Heshbon. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	4	At that time we took all his cities . There were
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	60	of them . We took the whole area of Argob . That was Og ’ s kingdom in Bashan .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	5	All those cities had high walls around them . The city gates were made secure with heavy metal bars . There were also large numbers of villages that didn ’ t have walls .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	6	We completely destroyed them . We did to them just as we had done to Sihon , the king of Heshbon . We destroyed all their cities . We destroyed the men , women and children .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	7	But we kept for ourselves the livestock and everything else we took from their cities .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	8	So at that time we took the territory east of the Jordan River . We captured it from those two Amorite kings . The territory goes all the way from the Arnon River valley to Mount Hermon .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	9	Hermon is called Sirion by the people of Sidon . The Amorites call it Senir .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	10	We captured all the towns on the high plains . We took the whole land of Gilead . And we captured the whole land of Bashan as far away as Salekah and Edrei . Those were towns that belonged to Og ’ s kingdom in Bashan .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	11	Og , the king of Bashan , was the only Rephaite left . His bed was decorated with iron . It was more than
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	13	I gave the rest of Gilead to half of the tribe of Manasseh . I also gave them the whole land of Bashan , the kingdom of Og . The whole area of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	12	I divided up the land we took over at that time . I gave the tribes of Reuben and Gad the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon River valley . It includes half of the hill country of Gilead together with its towns .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	14	Jair took the whole area of Argob . He was from the family line of Manasseh . Argob goes all the way to the border of the people of Geshur and Maakah . It was named after Jair . So Bashan is called Havvoth Jair to this very day .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	15	I gave Gilead to Makir .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	16	But I gave to the tribes of Reuben and Gad the territory that reaches from Gilead down to the Arnon River valley . It goes all the way to the Jabbok River . The Jabbok is the northern border of Ammon . The middle of the Arnon River valley is its southern border .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	17	The western border of Reuben and Gad is the Jordan River in the Arabah Valley . It reaches from the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea . It runs below the slopes of Pisgah .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	18	Here is the command I gave at that time to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh . I said , “ The Lord your God has given you this land as your very own . But all your strong men must be prepared for battle . They must cross over ahead of the rest of the Israelites .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	19	But your wives and children can stay in the towns I ’ ve given you . You can keep your livestock there too . I know you have a lot of livestock .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	20	The Lord has given you peace and rest . Then let your families and livestock stay in those towns until the Lord gives peace and rest to the other tribes . And let your families stay until the other tribes have taken over the land the Lord your God is giving them . That land is across the Jordan River . After that , each of you may go back to the land I ’ ve given you as your very own. ” The Lord Will Not Allow Moses to Cross the Jordan River
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	21	At that time I gave Joshua a command . I said , “ Your own eyes have seen everything the Lord your God has done to Sihon and Og . He will do the same thing to all the kingdoms in the land where you are going .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	22	Don ’ t be afraid of them . The Lord your God himself will fight for you. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	23	At that time I made my appeal to the Lord . I said ,
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	24	“ Lord and King , you have begun to show me how great you are . You have shown me how strong your hand is . You do great works and mighty acts . There isn ’ t any god in heaven or on earth who can do what you do .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	25	Let me go across the Jordan River . Let me see the good land beyond it . I want to see that fine hill country and Lebanon. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	26	But the Lord was angry with me because of what you did . He wouldn ’ t listen to me . “ That is enough ! ” the Lord said . “ Do not speak to me anymore about this matter .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	27	Go up to the highest slopes of Pisgah . Look west and north and south and east . Look at the land with your own eyes . But you are not going to go across this Jordan River .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	28	So appoint Joshua as the new leader . Help him to be brave . Give him hope and strength . He will take these people across the Jordan . You will see the land . But he will lead them into it to take it as their own. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	3	29	So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	4	But all of you who remained true to the Lord your God are still alive today .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	2	Don ’ t add to what I ’ m commanding you . Don ’ t subtract from it either . Instead , obey the commands of the Lord your God that I ’ m giving you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	3	Your own eyes saw what the Lord your God did at Baal Peor . He destroyed every one of your people who worshiped the Baal that was worshiped at Peor .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	5	I have taught you rules and laws , just as the Lord my God commanded me . Obey them in the land you are entering to take as your very own .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	6	Be careful to keep them . That will show the nations how wise and understanding you are . They will hear about all these rules . They ’ ll say , “ That great nation certainly has wise and understanding people. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	7	The Lord our God is near us every time we pray to him . What other nation is great enough to have its gods that close to them ?
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	8	I ’ m giving you the laws of the Lord today . What other nation is great enough to have rules and laws as fair as these ?
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	9	Don ’ t be careless . Instead , be very careful . Don ’ t forget the things your eyes have seen . As long as you live , don ’ t let them slip from your mind . Teach them to your children and their children after them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	10	Remember the day you stood at Mount Horeb . The Lord your God was there . He said to me , “ Bring the people to me to hear my words . I want them to learn to have respect for me as long as they live in the land . I want them to teach my words to their children. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	11	You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain . It blazed with fire that reached as high as the very heavens . There were black clouds and deep darkness .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	12	Then the Lord spoke to you out of the fire . You heard the sound of his words . But you didn ’ t see any shape or form . You only heard a voice .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	13	He announced his covenant to you . That covenant is the Ten Commandments . He commanded you to obey them . Then he wrote them down on two stone tablets .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	14	At that time the Lord directed me to teach you his rules and laws . You must obey them in the land you are crossing the Jordan River to take as your own . Don ’ t Make or Worship Statues of Gods
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	15	The Lord spoke to you at Mount Horeb out of the fire . But you didn ’ t see any shape or form that day . So be very careful .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	16	Make sure you don ’ t commit a horrible sin . Don ’ t make for yourselves a statue of a god . Don ’ t make a god that looks like a man or woman or anything else .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	17	Don ’ t make one that looks like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the sky .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	18	Don ’ t make a statue that looks like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish that swims in the water .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	19	When you look up at the heavens , you will see the sun and moon . And you will see huge numbers of stars . Don ’ t let anyone tempt you to bow down to the sun , moon or stars . Don ’ t worship things the Lord your God has provided for all the nations on earth .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	20	Egypt was like a furnace that melts iron down and makes it pure . But the Lord took you and brought you out of Egypt . He wanted you to be his very own people . And that ’ s exactly what you are .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	21	The Lord was angry with me because of what you did . He promised that he would never let me go across the Jordan River . He promised that I would never enter that good land . It ’ s the land the Lord your God is giving you as your own .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	22	I ’ ll die here in this land . I won ’ t go across the Jordan . But you are about to cross over it . You will take that good land as your own .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	23	Be careful . Don ’ t forget the covenant the Lord your God made with you . Don ’ t make for yourselves a statue of any god at all . He has told you not to . So don ’ t do it .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	24	The Lord your God is like a fire that burns everything up . He wants you to worship only him .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	25	So don ’ t make a statue of a god . Don ’ t commit that horrible sin . Don ’ t do it even after you have had children and grandchildren . Don ’ t do it even after you have lived in the land a long time . If you do , that will be an evil thing in the sight of the Lord your God . You will make him angry .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	26	Today I ’ m calling out to the heavens and the earth to be witnesses against you . Suppose you do these things . Then you will quickly die in the land you are going across the Jordan River to take over . You won ’ t live there very long . You will certainly be destroyed .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	27	The Lord will drive you out of your land . He will scatter you among the nations . Only a few of you will remain alive there .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	28	There you will worship gods that men have made out of wood and stone . Those gods can ’ t see , hear , eat or smell .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	29	Perhaps while you are there , you will seek the Lord your God . You will find him if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	30	All the things I ’ ve told you about might happen to you . And you will be in trouble . But later you will return to the Lord your God . You will obey him .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	31	The Lord your God is tender and loving . He won ’ t leave you or destroy you . He won ’ t forget the covenant he made with your people of long ago . He gave his word when he made it . The Lord Is God
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	32	Ask now about the days of long ago . Find out what happened long before your time . Ask about what has happened since the time God created human beings on the earth . Ask from one end of the world to the other . Has anything as great as this ever happened ? Has anything like it ever been heard of ?
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	33	You heard the voice of God speaking out of fire . And you lived ! Has that happened to any other people ?
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	34	Has any god ever tried to take one nation out of another to be his own ? Has any god done it by testing his people ? Has any god done it with signs and amazing deeds or with war ? Has any god reached out his mighty hand and powerful arm ? Or has any god shown his people his great and wonderful acts ? The Lord your God did all those things for you in Egypt . With your very own eyes you saw him do them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	35	The Lord showed you those things so that you might know he is God . There is no other God except him .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	36	From heaven he made you hear his voice . He wanted to teach you . On earth he showed you his great fire . You heard his words coming out of the fire .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	37	He loved your people of long ago . He chose their children after them . So he brought you out of Egypt . He used his great strength to do it .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	38	He drove out nations to make room for you . They were greater and stronger than you are . He will bring you into their land . He wants to give it to you as your very own . The whole land is as good as yours right now .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	39	The Lord is God in heaven above and on the earth below . Today you must agree with that and take it to heart . There is no other God .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	40	I ’ m giving you his rules and commands today . Obey them . Then things will go well with you and your children after you . You will live a long time in the land . The Lord your God is giving you the land for all time to come . Cities to Run to for Safety
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	41	Then Moses set apart three cities east of the Jordan River .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	42	Suppose someone killed a person they didn ’ t hate and without meaning to do it . That person could run to one of those cities and stay alive .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	43	Here are the names of the cities . Bezer was for the people of Reuben . It was in the high plains in the desert . Ramoth was for the people of Gad . It was in Gilead . Golan was for the people of Manasseh . It was in Bashan . Moses Gives the Law to Israel
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	44	Here is the law Moses gave the Israelites .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	45	Here are its terms , rules and laws . Moses gave them to the people when they came out of Egypt .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	46	They were now east of the Jordan River in the valley near Beth Peor . They were in the land of Sihon , the king of the Amorites . He ruled in Heshbon . But Moses and the Israelites won the battle over him after we came out of Egypt .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	47	They captured his land and made it their own . They also took the land of Og , the king of Bashan . Sihon and Og were the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	48	Their land reached from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon River valley to Mount Hermon .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	4	49	It included the whole Arabah Valley east of the Jordan . It included land all the way to the Dead Sea below the slopes of Pisgah . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	5	At that time I stood between the Lord and you . I announced to you the Lord ’ s message . I did it because you were afraid of the fire . You didn ’ t go up the mountain . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	2	The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Mount Horeb .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	3	He didn ’ t make it only with our people of long ago . He also made it with us . In fact , he made it with all of us who are alive here today .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	4	The Lord spoke to you face to face . His voice came out of the fire on the mountain .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	6	“ I am the Lord your God . I brought you out of Egypt . That is the land where you were slaves .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	7	“ Do not put any other gods in place of me .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	8	“ Do not make statues of gods that look like anything in the sky or on the earth or in the waters .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	9	Do not bow down to them or worship them . I am the Lord your God . I want you to worship only me . I cause the sins of the parents to affect their children . I will cause the sins of those who hate me to affect even their grandchildren and great-grandchildren .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	10	But for all time to come I show love to all those who love me and keep my commandments .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	11	“ Do not misuse the name of the Lord your God . The Lord will find guilty anyone who misuses his name .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	12	“ Keep the Sabbath day holy . Do this just as the Lord your God has commanded you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	13	Do all your work in six days .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	14	But the seventh day is a sabbath to honor the Lord your God . Do not do any work on that day . The same command applies to your sons and daughters , your male and female servants , your oxen , your donkeys and your other animals . It also applies to any outsiders who live in your towns . I want your male and female servants to rest , just as you do .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	15	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt . The Lord your God reached out his mighty hand and powerful arm and brought you out of there . So the Lord your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day holy .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	16	“ Honor your father and mother , just as the Lord your God has commanded you . Then you will live a long time in the land he is giving you . And things will go well with you there .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	17	“ Do not murder .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	18	“ Do not commit adultery .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	19	“ Do not steal .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	20	“ Do not be a false witness against your neighbor .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	21	“ Do not want to have your neighbor ’ s wife . Do not desire anything your neighbor owns . Do not desire to have your neighbor ’ s house or land , male or female servant , ox or donkey. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	22	These are the commandments the Lord announced in a loud voice to your whole community . He gave them to you there on the mountain . He spoke out of the fire , cloud and deep darkness . He didn ’ t add anything else . Then he wrote the commandments on two stone tablets . And he gave them to me .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	23	The mountain was blazing with fire . You heard the voice coming out of the darkness . So your elders and all the leaders of your tribes came to me .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	24	You said , “ The Lord our God has shown us his glory and majesty . We have heard his voice coming out of the fire . Today we have seen that a person can still stay alive even if God speaks with them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	25	But why should we die ? This great fire will burn us up . We ’ ll die if we hear the voice of the Lord our God again .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	26	We have heard the voice of the living God . We ’ ve heard him speaking out of the fire . Has any other human being ever heard him speak like that and stayed alive ?
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	27	Go near and listen to everything the Lord our God says . Then tell us what he tells you . We will listen and obey. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	28	The Lord heard you when you spoke to me . He said to me , “ I have heard what these people said to you . Everything they said was good .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	29	But I wish they would always have respect for me in their hearts . I wish they would always obey all my commands . Then things would go well with them and their children forever .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	30	“ Go and tell them to return to their tents .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	31	But you stay here with me . Then I will give you all my commands , rules and laws . You must teach the people to obey them in the land I am giving them as their very own. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	32	So be careful to do what the Lord your God has commanded you . Don ’ t turn away from his commands to the right or the left .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	5	33	Live exactly as the Lord your God has commanded you to live . Then you will enjoy life in the land you will soon own . Things will go well with you there . You will live there for a long time . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	6	9	Write them on the doorframes of your houses . Also write them on your gates .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	6	10	The Lord your God will bring you into the land of Canaan . He gave his word . He promised he would give the land to your fathers , to Abraham , Isaac and Jacob . The land has large , wealthy cities you didn ’ t build .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	6	11	It has houses filled with all kinds of good things you didn ’ t provide . The land has wells you didn ’ t dig . And it has vineyards and groves of olive trees you didn ’ t plant . You will have plenty to eat .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	6	12	But be careful that you don ’ t forget the Lord . Remember that he brought you out of Egypt . That ’ s the land where you were slaves .

NIRV	Deuteronomy	6	20	Later on , your child might ask you , “ What is the meaning of the terms , rules and laws the Lord our God has commanded you to obey ? ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	6	21	If they do ask you , tell them , “ We were Pharaoh ’ s slaves in Egypt . But the Lord used his mighty hand to bring us out of Egypt .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	6	22	With our own eyes we saw the Lord send amazing signs . They were great and terrible . He sent them on Egypt and Pharaoh and everyone in his house .

NIRV	Deuteronomy	7	7	The Lord chose you because he loved you very much . He didn ’ t choose you because you had more people than other nations . In fact , you had the smallest number of all .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	7	2	The Lord your God will hand them over to you . You will win the battle over them . You must completely destroy them . Don ’ t make a peace treaty with them . Don ’ t show them any mercy .

NIRV	Deuteronomy	7	5	So here is what you must do to those people . Break down their altars . Smash their sacred stones . Cut down the poles they use to worship the female god named Asherah . Burn the statues of their gods in the fire .

NIRV	Deuteronomy	8	40	years . Your feet didn ’ t swell .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	8	3	He took your pride away . He let you go hungry . Then he gave you manna to eat . You and your parents had never even known anything about manna before .

NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	9	I went up the mountain . I went there to receive the tablets of the covenant law . They were made out of stone . It was the covenant the Lord had made with you . I stayed on the mountain for
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	2	The people who live there are Anakites . They are strong and tall . You know all about them . You have heard people say , “ Who can stand up against the Anakites ? ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	3	But today you can be sure the Lord your God will go over there ahead of you . He is like a fire that will burn them up . He ’ ll destroy them . He ’ ll bring them under your control . You will drive them out . You will put an end to them quickly , just as the Lord has promised you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	4	The Lord your God will drive them out to make room for you . When he does , don ’ t say to yourself , “ The Lord has done it because I am godly . That ’ s why he brought me here to take over this land. ” That isn ’ t true . The Lord is going to drive out those nations to make room for you because they are very evil .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	5	You are not going in to take over their land because you have done what is right or honest . It ’ s because those nations are so evil . That ’ s why the Lord your God will drive them out to make room for you . He will do what he said he would do . He made a promise to your fathers , to Abraham , Isaac and Jacob .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	6	The Lord your God is giving you this good land to take as your own . But you must understand that it isn ’ t because you are a godly nation . In fact , you are stubborn . Israel Worshiped the Golden Calf
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	7	Here is something you must remember . Never forget it . You made the Lord your God angry in the desert . You refused to obey him from the day you left Egypt until you arrived here .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	8	At Mount Horeb you made the Lord angry enough to destroy you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	40	nights . I did it because the Lord had said he would destroy you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	10	The Lord gave me two stone tablets . The words on them were written by the finger of God . All the commandments the Lord gave you were written on the tablets . He announced them to you out of the fire on the mountain . He wrote them on the day you gathered together there .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	11	The
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	12	The Lord told me , “ Go down from here right away . The people you brought out of Egypt have become very sinful . They have quickly turned away from what I commanded them . They have made a statue of a god for themselves. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	13	The Lord also said to me , “ I have seen these people . They are so stubborn !
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	14	Do not try to stop me . I am going to destroy them . I will wipe them out from the earth . Then I will make you into a great nation . Your people will be stronger than they were . There will be more of you than there were of them. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	15	So I turned and went down the mountain . It was blazing with fire . I was carrying the two tablets of the covenant law .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	16	When I looked , I saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God . You had made for yourselves a metal statue of a god . It looked like a calf . You had quickly turned away from the path the Lord had commanded you to follow .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	17	So I threw the two tablets out of my hands . You watched them break into pieces .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	18	Then once again I fell down flat in front of the Lord with my face toward the ground . I lay there for
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	19	I was afraid of the Lord ’ s great anger . He was so angry with you he wanted to destroy you . But the Lord listened to me again .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	20	And he was so angry with Aaron he wanted to destroy him too . But at that time I prayed for Aaron .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	21	I also got that sinful calf you had made . I burned it in the fire . I crushed it and ground it into fine powder . Then I threw the powder into a stream that was flowing down the mountain .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	22	You also made the Lord angry at Taberah , Massah and Kibroth Hattaavah .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	23	The Lord sent you out from Kadesh Barnea . He said , “ Go up and take over the land I have given you. ” But you refused to do what the Lord your God had commanded you to do . You didn ’ t trust him or obey him .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	24	You have been refusing to obey the Lord as long as I ’ ve known you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	25	I lay down in front of the Lord with my face toward the ground for
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	26	I prayed to him . “ Lord and King , ” I said , “ don ’ t destroy your people . They belong to you . You set them free by your great power . You used your mighty hand to bring them out of Egypt .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	27	Remember your servants Abraham , Isaac and Jacob . Forgive the Israelites for being so stubborn . Don ’ t judge them for the evil and sinful things they ’ ve done .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	28	If you do , the Egyptians will say , ‘ The Lord wasn ’ t able to take them into the land he had promised to give them . He hated them . So he brought them out of Egypt to put them to death in the desert. ’
NIRV	Deuteronomy	9	29	But they are your people . They belong to you . You used your great power to bring them out of Egypt . You reached out your mighty arm and saved them. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	3	So I made the ark out of acacia wood . I carved out two stone tablets that were just like the first ones . I went up the mountain . I carried the two tablets in my hands .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	4	The Lord wrote on the tablets what he had written before . It was the Ten Commandments . He had announced them to you out of the fire on the mountain . It was on the day you had gathered together there . So the Lord gave the tablets to me .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	5	Then I came back down the mountain . I put the tablets in the ark I had made , just as the Lord had commanded me . And that ’ s where they are now .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	6	Remember how the Israelites traveled from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah . That ’ s where Aaron died . And his body was buried there . His son Eleazar became the next priest after him .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	7	From Moserah the people traveled to Gudgodah . Then they went on to Jotbathah . That land has streams of water .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	8	At that time the Lord set the tribe of Levi apart . He appointed them to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord . He wanted them to serve him . He told them to bless the people in his name . And they still do it today .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	9	That ’ s why the Levites don ’ t have any part of the land the Lord gave the other tribes in Israel . They don ’ t have any share among them . The Lord himself is their share . That ’ s what the Lord your God told them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	40	nights , just as I did the first time . The Lord listened to me that time also . He didn ’ t want to destroy you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	11	“ Go , ” the Lord said to me . “ Lead the people on their way . Then they can enter the land and take it over . I have given my word . I promised I would give the land to their fathers , to Abraham , Isaac and Jacob. ” Honor the Lord
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	12	And now , Israel , what is the Lord your God asking you to do ? Honor him . Live exactly as he wants you to live . Love him . Serve him with all your heart and with all your soul .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	13	Obey the Lord ’ s commands and rules . I ’ m giving them to you today for your own good .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	14	The heavens belong to the Lord your God . Even the highest heavens belong to him . He owns the earth and everything in it .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	15	But the Lord loved your people of long ago very much . You are their children . And he chose you above all the other nations . His love and his promise remain with you to this very day .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	16	So don ’ t be stubborn anymore . Obey the Lord .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	17	The Lord your God is the greatest God of all . He is the greatest Lord of all . He is the great God . He is mighty and wonderful . He treats everyone the same . He doesn ’ t accept any money from those who want special favors .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	18	He stands up for widows and for children whose fathers have died . He loves outsiders living among you . He gives them food and clothes .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	19	So you also must love outsiders . Remember that you yourselves were outsiders in Egypt .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	20	Honor the Lord your God . Serve him . Remain true to him . When you make promises , do so in his name .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	21	He is the one you should praise . He ’ s your God . With your own eyes you saw the great and amazing things he did for you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	22	Long ago , your people went down into Egypt . The total number of them was
NIRV	Deuteronomy	10	70	. And now the Lord your God has made you as many as the stars in the sky . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	11	But you will soon go across the Jordan River . The land you are going to take over has mountains and valleys in it . It drinks rain from heaven .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	2	Remember today that your children weren ’ t the ones the Lord your God guided and corrected . They didn ’ t see his majesty . They weren ’ t in Egypt when he reached out his mighty hand and powerful arm .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	3	They didn ’ t see the signs and the other things he did in Egypt . They didn ’ t see what he did to Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , and to his whole country .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	4	They weren ’ t there when the Lord destroyed the army of Egypt and its horses and chariots . He swept the waters of the Red Sea over the Egyptians while they were chasing you . He wiped them out forever .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	5	Your children didn ’ t see what he did for you in the desert before you arrived here .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	6	They didn ’ t see what he did to Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab . Eliab was from the tribe of Reuben . The earth opened its mouth right in the middle of the Israelite camp . It swallowed up Dathan and Abiram . It swallowed them up together with their families , tents and every living thing that belonged to them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	7	But with your own eyes you saw all the great things the Lord has done .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	8	So obey all the commands I ’ m giving you today . Then you will be strong enough to go in and take over the land . You will go across the Jordan River and take the land as your own .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	9	You will live there for a long time . It ’ s the land the Lord promised to give to Abraham , Isaac and Jacob and their children after them . He gave his word when he made that promise . The land has plenty of milk and honey .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	10	You will enter it and take it over . It isn ’ t like the land of Egypt . That ’ s where you came from . You planted your seeds there . You had to water them , just as you have to water a vegetable garden .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	12	It ’ s a land the Lord your God takes care of . His eyes always look on it with favor . He watches over it from the beginning of the year to its end .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	13	So be faithful . Obey the commands the Lord your God is giving you today . Love him . Serve him with all your heart and with all your soul .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	14	Then the Lord will send rain on your land at the right time . He ’ ll send rain in the fall and in the spring . You will be able to gather your grain . You will also be able to make olive oil and fresh wine .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	15	He ’ ll provide grass in the fields for your cattle . You will have plenty to eat .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	16	But be careful . Don ’ t let anyone tempt you to do something wrong . Don ’ t turn away and worship other gods . Don ’ t bow down to them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	17	If you do , the Lord will be very angry with you . He ’ ll close up the sky . It won ’ t rain . The ground won ’ t produce its crops . Soon you will die . You won ’ t live to enjoy the good land the Lord is giving you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	18	So keep my words in your hearts and minds . Write them down and tie them on your hands as a reminder . Also tie them on your foreheads .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	19	Teach them to your children . Talk about them when you are at home . Talk about them when you walk along the road . Speak about them when you go to bed . And speak about them when you get up .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	20	Write them on the doorframes of your houses . Also write them on your gates .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	21	Then you and your children will live for a long time in the land . The Lord promised to give the land to Abraham , Isaac and Jacob . Your family line will continue as long as the heavens remain above the earth .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	22	So be careful . Obey all the commands I ’ m giving you to follow . Love the Lord your God . Live exactly as he wants you to live . Remain true to him .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	23	Then the Lord will drive out all the nations to make room for you . They are larger and stronger than you are . But you will take their land .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	24	Every place you walk on will belong to you . Your territory will go all the way from the desert to Lebanon . It will go from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	25	No one will be able to stand up against you . The Lord your God will throw the whole land into a panic because of you . He ’ ll do it everywhere you go , just as he promised you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	26	Listen to me . I ’ m setting a blessing and a curse in front of you today .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	27	I ’ m giving you the commands of the Lord your God today . You will be blessed if you obey them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	28	But you will be cursed if you don ’ t obey them . So don ’ t turn away from the path I ’ m now commanding you to take . Don ’ t turn away by worshiping other gods you didn ’ t know before .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	29	The Lord your God will bring you into the land to take it over . When he does , you must announce the blessings from Mount Gerizim . You must announce the curses from Mount Ebal .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	30	As you know , those mountains are across the Jordan River . They are on the west side of the Jordan toward the setting sun . They are near the large trees of Moreh . The mountains are in the territory of the Canaanites , who live in the Arabah Valley near Gilgal .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	31	You are about to go across the Jordan River . You will enter the land and take it over . The Lord your God is giving it to you . You will take it over and live there .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	11	32	When you do , make sure you obey all the rules and laws I ’ m giving you today . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	12	Be filled with joy there in the sight of the Lord your God . Your children should also be joyful . So should your male and female servants . And so should the Levites from your towns . The Levites won ’ t receive any part of the land as their share .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	2	You will soon drive the nations out of it . Completely destroy all the places where they worship their gods . Destroy them on the high mountains , on the hills and under every green tree .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	3	Break down their altars . Smash their sacred stones . Burn up the poles they use to worship the female god named Asherah . Cut down the statues of their gods . Wipe out the names of their gods from those places .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	4	You must not worship the Lord your God the way those nations worship their gods .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	5	Instead , go to the special place he will choose from among all your tribes . He will put his Name there . That ’ s where you must go .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	6	Take your burnt offerings and sacrifices to that place . Bring your special gifts and a tenth of everything you produce . Take with you what you have promised to give . Bring any other offerings you choose to give . And bring the male animals among your livestock that were born first to their mothers .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	7	You and your families will eat at the place the Lord your God will choose . He will be with you there . You will find joy in everything you have done . That ’ s because he has blessed you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	8	You must not do as we ’ re doing here today . All of us are doing only what we think is right .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	9	That ’ s because you haven ’ t yet reached the place the Lord is giving you . Your God will give you peace and rest there .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	10	But first you will go across the Jordan River . You will settle in the land he ’ s giving you . It will belong to you as your share . He will give you peace and rest from all your enemies around you . You will live in safety .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	11	The Lord your God will choose a special place . He will put his Name there . That ’ s where you must bring everything I command you to bring . That includes your burnt offerings and sacrifices . It includes your special gifts and a tenth of everything you produce . It also includes all the things of value that you promised to give to the Lord .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	13	Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you want to .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	14	Offer them only at the place the Lord will choose in one of your tribes . There you must obey everything I command you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	15	But you can kill your animals in any of your towns . You can eat as much of the meat as you want to . You can eat it as if it were antelope or deer meat . That is part of the blessing the Lord your God is giving you . Those who are “ clean ” and those who are not can eat it .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	16	But you must not eat meat that still has blood in it . Pour the blood out on the ground like water .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	17	Here are the things you must not eat in your own towns . You must not eat the tenth part of your grain , olive oil and fresh wine . It belongs to the Lord . You must not eat the male animals among your livestock that were born first to their mothers . Don ’ t eat anything you have promised to give . Don ’ t eat any offerings you have chosen to give . And you must not eat any of your special gifts .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	18	Instead , you must eat all those things in the sight of the Lord your God . Do it at the place he will choose . You , your children , your male and female servants and the Levites from your towns can eat them . Be filled with joy in the sight of the Lord your God . Be joyful in everything you do .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	19	Don ’ t forget to take care of the Levites as long as you live in your land .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	20	The Lord your God will increase your territory , just as he has promised you . When he does , you might get hungry for meat . You might say , “ I ’ d really like some meat. ” Then you can eat as much of it as you want to .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	21	The Lord your God will choose a special place . He will put his Name there . But suppose that place is too far away from you . Then you can kill animals from the herds and flocks the Lord has given you . Do it just as I have commanded you . In your own towns you can eat as much of the meat as you want to .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	22	Eat it as you would eat antelope or deer meat . Those who are “ clean ” and those who are not can eat it .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	23	But be sure you don ’ t eat meat that still has blood in it . The blood is the animal ’ s life . So you must not eat the life along with the meat .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	24	You must not eat the blood . Pour it out on the ground like water .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	25	Don ’ t eat it . Then things will go well with you and your children after you . You will be doing what is right in the eyes of the Lord .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	26	But go to the place the Lord will choose . Take with you the things you have set apart for him . Bring what you have promised to give him .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	27	Sacrifice your burnt offerings on the altar of the Lord your God . Offer the meat and the blood there . The blood of your sacrifices must be poured out beside his altar . But you can eat the meat .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	28	Make sure you obey all the rules I ’ m giving you . Then things will always go well with you and your children after you . That ’ s because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of the Lord your God .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	29	You are about to attack the land and take it over as your own . When you do , the Lord your God will destroy the nations who live there . He will do it to make room for you . You will drive them out . You will settle in their land .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	30	They will be destroyed to make room for you . But when they are destroyed , be careful . Don ’ t be trapped . Don ’ t ask questions about their gods . Don ’ t say , “ How do these nations serve their gods ? We ’ ll do it in the same way. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	12	31	You must not worship the Lord your God the way they worship their gods . When they worship , they do all kinds of evil things the Lord hates . They even burn up their children in the fire as sacrifices to their gods .

NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	13	You hear that people who cause trouble have appeared among you . They ’ ve tried to get the people of their town to do something wrong . They ’ ve said , “ Let ’ s go and worship other gods. ” But you haven ’ t known anything about those gods before .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	2	The sign or amazing thing he has spoken about might really take place . And then the prophet might say , “ Let ’ s serve other gods . Let ’ s worship them. ” But you haven ’ t known anything about those gods before .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	3	So you must not listen to what that prophet or dreamer has said . The Lord your God is testing you . He wants to know whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	4	You must worship him . You must honor him . Keep his commands . Obey him . Serve him . Remain true to him .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	5	That prophet or dreamer must be put to death . He told you not to obey the Lord your God . The Lord brought you out of Egypt . He set you free from the land where you were slaves . He commanded you to live the way he wants you to . But that prophet or dreamer has tried to get you to be unfaithful to the Lord . Get rid of that evil person .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	6	Suppose your very own brother or sister secretly tempts you to do something wrong . Or your child or the wife you love tempts you . Or your closest friend does it . Suppose one of them says , “ Let ’ s go and worship other gods. ” But you and your people of long ago hadn ’ t known anything about those gods before .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	7	They are the gods of the nations around you . Those nations might be near or far away . In fact , they might reach from one end of the land to the other .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	8	Don ’ t give in to those who are tempting you . Don ’ t listen to them . Don ’ t feel sorry for them . Don ’ t spare them or save them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	9	You must certainly put them to death . You must be the first to throw stones at them . Then all the people must do the same thing .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	10	Put them to death by throwing stones at them . They tried to turn you away from the Lord your God . He brought you out of Egypt . That ’ s the land where you were slaves .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	11	After you kill those who tempted you , all the Israelites will hear about it . And they will be too scared to do an evil thing like that again .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	12	The Lord your God is giving you towns to live in . But suppose you hear something bad about one of those towns .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	14	So you must ask people some questions . You must check out the matter carefully . If it ’ s true , an evil thing has really happened among you . It ’ s something the Lord hates .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	15	Then you must certainly kill with your swords everyone who lives in that town . You must destroy it completely . You must wipe out its people and livestock .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	16	You must gather all the goods of that town into the middle of the main street . You must burn the town completely . You must burn up everything in it . It ’ s a whole burnt offering to the Lord your God . The town must remain a pile of stones forever . It must never be built again .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	17	Don ’ t keep anything that should be destroyed . Then the Lord will turn away from his great anger . He will show you mercy . He ’ ll have deep concern for you . He ’ ll cause there to be many of you . That ’ s what he promised your people of long ago . He gave his word when he made the promise .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	13	18	The Lord your God will do those things if you obey him . I ’ m giving you his commands today . And you must obey all of them . You must do what is right in his eyes . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	14	5	deer , gazelles , roe deer , wild goats , ibexes , antelope and mountain sheep .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	14	6	You can eat any animal that has a divided hoof . But it must also chew the cud .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	14	7	Some animals only chew the cud . Others only have a divided hoof . The camel , rabbit and rock badger chew the cud , but they don ’ t have a divided hoof . So you can ’ t eat them . They are not “ clean ” for you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	14	8	Pigs aren ’ t “ clean ” for you either . They have a divided hoof , but they don ’ t chew the cud . So don ’ t eat their meat . And don ’ t touch their dead bodies .

NIRV	Deuteronomy	14	19	All flying insects are “ unclean ” for you . So don ’ t eat them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	14	20	But you can eat any creature that has wings and is “ clean. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	14	21	If you find something that ’ s already dead , don ’ t eat it . You can give it to an outsider living in any of your towns . They may eat it . Or you can sell it to someone from another country . But you are a holy nation . The Lord your God has set you apart for himself . Don ’ t cook a young goat in its mother ’ s milk . Give a Tenth of What You Produce
NIRV	Deuteronomy	14	22	Be sure to set apart a tenth of everything your fields produce each year .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	14	23	Here are the things you should eat in the sight of the Lord your God . You should eat a tenth part of your grain , olive oil and fresh wine . You should also eat the male animals among your livestock that were born first to their mothers . Eat all these things at the special place the Lord your God will choose . He will put his Name there . You will learn to honor him always .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	14	24	But suppose the place the Lord will choose for his Name is too far away from you . And suppose your God has blessed you . And your tenth part is too heavy for you to carry .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	14	25	Then sell it for silver . Take the silver with you . Go to the place the Lord your God will choose .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	14	26	Use the silver to buy anything you like . It can be cattle or sheep . It can be any kind of wine . In fact , it can be anything else you wish . Then you and your family can eat there in the sight of the Lord your God . You can be filled with joy .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	14	27	Don ’ t forget to take care of the Levites who will live in your towns . They won ’ t receive any part of the land as their share .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	14	28	At the end of every three years , bring a tenth of everything you produce that year . Store it in your towns .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	14	29	Then the Levites can come and eat . That ’ s because they won ’ t receive any part of the land as their share . The outsiders and widows who live in your towns can come . So can the children whose fathers have died . Everyone can have plenty to eat . Then the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	15	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt . The Lord your God set you free . That ’ s why I ’ m giving you this command today .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	2	Have you made a loan to one of your own people ? Then forgive what is owed to you . You can ’ t require that person to pay you back . The Lord ’ s time to forgive what is owed has been announced .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	3	You can require someone from another nation to pay you back . But you must forgive what any of your own people owes you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	4	There shouldn ’ t be any poor people among you . The Lord will greatly bless you in the land he is giving you . You will take it over as your own .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	5	The Lord your God will bless you if you obey him completely . Be careful to follow all the commands I ’ m giving you today .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	6	The Lord your God will bless you , just as he has promised . You will lend money to many nations . But you won ’ t have to borrow from any of them . You will rule over many nations . But none of them will rule over you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	7	Suppose someone is poor among you . And suppose they live in one of the towns in the land the Lord your God is giving you . Then don ’ t be mean to them . They are poor . So don ’ t hold back money from them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	8	Instead , open your hands and lend them what they need . Do it freely .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	9	Be careful not to have an evil thought in your mind . Don ’ t say to yourself , “ The seventh year will soon be here . It ’ s the year for forgiving people what they owe. ” If you think like that , you might treat the needy people among you badly . You might not give them anything . Then they might make their appeal to the Lord against you . And he will find you guilty of sin .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	10	So give freely to needy people . Let your heart be tender toward them . Then the Lord your God will bless you in all your work . He will bless you in everything you do .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	11	There will always be poor people in the land . So I ’ m commanding you to give freely to those who are poor and needy in your land . Open your hands to them . Set Your Hebrew Servants Free
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	12	Suppose any Hebrew men or women sell themselves to you . If they do , they will serve you for six years . Then in the seventh year you must let them go free .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	13	But when you set them free , don ’ t send them away without anything to show for all their work .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	14	Freely give them some animals from your flock . Also give them some of your grain and wine . The Lord your God has blessed you richly . Give to them as he has given to you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	16	But suppose your servant says to you , “ I don ’ t want to leave you. ” He loves you and your family . And you are taking good care of him .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	17	Then take him to the door of your house . Poke a hole through his earlobe into the doorpost . And he will become your servant for life . Do the same with your female servant .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	18	Don ’ t think you are being cheated when you set your servants free . After all , they have served you for six years . The service of each of them has been worth twice as much as the service of a hired worker . And the Lord your God will bless you in everything you do . Male Animals Born First to Their Mothers
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	19	Set apart every male animal among your livestock that was born first to its mother . Set it apart to the Lord your God . Don ’ t put a firstborn cow to work . Don ’ t clip the wool from a firstborn sheep .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	20	Each year you and your family must eat them . Do it in front of the Lord your God at the place he will choose .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	21	Suppose an animal has something wrong with it . It might not be able to see or walk . Or it might have a bad flaw . Then you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	22	You must eat it in your own towns . Those who are “ clean ” and those who are “ unclean ” can eat it . Eat it as if it were antelope or deer meat .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	15	23	But you must not eat meat that still has blood in it . Pour the blood out on the ground like water . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	16	16	All your men must appear in front of the Lord your God at the holy tent . They must go to the place he will choose . They must do it three times a year .

NIRV	Deuteronomy	16	2	Sacrifice an animal from your flock or herd . It is the Passover sacrifice to honor the Lord your God . Sacrifice it at the special place the Lord will choose . He will put his Name there .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	16	3	Don ’ t eat the animal along with bread made with yeast . Instead , for seven days eat bread made without yeast . It ’ s the bread that reminds you of how much you suffered . Remember that you left Egypt in a hurry . Remember it all the days of your life . Don ’ t forget the day you left Egypt .

NIRV	Deuteronomy	16	10	Then celebrate the Feast of Weeks to honor the Lord your God . Give to the Lord anything you choose to give as an offering . Give , just as the Lord has given to you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	16	11	Be filled with joy in the sight of the Lord your God . Be joyful at the special place he will choose for his Name . You , your children , and your male and female servants should be joyful . So should the Levites living in your towns . So should the outsiders and widows living among you . And so should the children whose fathers have died .

NIRV	Deuteronomy	16	19	Do what is right . Treat everyone the same . Don ’ t take money from people who want special favors . It makes those who are wise close their eyes to the truth . It twists the words of those who have done nothing wrong .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	16	20	Do only what is right . Then you will live . You will take over the land the Lord your God is giving you . Don ’ t Worship Other Gods
NIRV	Deuteronomy	16	21	Don ’ t set up a wooden pole used to worship the female god named Asherah . Don ’ t set it up beside the altar you build to worship the Lord your God .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	16	22	Don ’ t set up a sacred stone to honor another god . The Lord your God hates Asherah poles and sacred stones . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	17	The king must not have many wives . If he does , they will lead him astray . He must not store up large amounts of silver and gold .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	2	Someone living among you might do what is evil in the sight of the Lord your God . It might happen in one of the towns the Lord is giving you . That person is breaking the Lord ’ s covenant .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	3	The person might have worshiped or bowed down to other gods . That person might have bowed down to the sun or moon or stars in the sky . I have commanded you not to do these things .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	4	When you hear that people have done something like that , check the matter out carefully . If it ’ s true , an evil thing has been done in Israel . The Lord hates that .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	5	So take the person who has done that evil thing to your city gate . Put that person to death by throwing stones at them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	6	Two or three witnesses are required to put someone to death . No one can be put to death because of what only one witness says . Two or three witnesses are required .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	7	The witnesses must throw the first stones . Then the rest of the people must also throw stones . Get rid of that evil person . Law Courts
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	8	People will bring their cases to your courts . But some cases will be too hard for you to judge . They might be about murders , attacks or other crimes . Then take those hard cases to the place the Lord your God will choose .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	9	Go to a priest , who is a Levite . And go to the judge who is in office at that time . Ask them for their decision . They will give it to you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	10	They ’ ll hand down their decisions at the place the Lord will choose . You must do what they decide . Be careful to do everything they tell you to do .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	11	Act according to whatever they teach you . Accept the decisions they give you . Don ’ t turn away from what they tell you . Don ’ t turn to the right or the left .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	12	Someone might show that they don ’ t respect the judge . Or they will show that they don ’ t respect the priest . The priest will serve the Lord your God at the place God will choose . If anyone doesn ’ t show respect for these people , that person must be put to death . Remove that evil person from Israel .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	13	All the Israelites will hear about it . And they will be afraid to disrespect a judge or priest again . Appoint the King the Lord Chooses
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	14	You will enter the land the Lord your God is giving you . You will take it as your own . You will make your homes in it . When you do , you will say , “ Let ’ s appoint a king over us , just like all the nations around us. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	15	When that happens , make sure you appoint over yourselves a king the Lord your God chooses . He must be from among your own people . Don ’ t appoint over yourselves someone from another country . Don ’ t choose anyone who isn ’ t from one of the tribes of Israel .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	16	The king must not get large numbers of horses for himself . He must not make the people return to Egypt to get more horses . The Lord has told you , “ You must not go back there again. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	18	When he sits on the throne of his kingdom , he must make for himself a copy of the law . He must write on a scroll the law that I am teaching you . He must copy it from the scroll of a priest , who is a Levite .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	19	The king must keep the scroll close to him at all times . He must read it all the days of his life . Then he can learn to have respect for the Lord his God . He can carefully obey all the words of this law and these rules .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	17	20	He won ’ t think of himself as being better than his people are . He won ’ t turn away from the law . He won ’ t turn to the right or the left . Then he and his sons after him will rule over his kingdom in Israel for a long time . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	18	I will raise up for them a prophet like you . He will be one of their own people . I will put my words in his mouth . He will tell them everything I command him to say .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	2	They won ’ t have any part of the land the Lord gave the other tribes in Israel . The Lord himself is their share , just as he promised them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	3	Anyone who sacrifices a bull or a sheep owes a share of it to the priests . Their share is the shoulder , the inside parts and the meat from the head .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	4	You must give the priests the first share of the harvest of your grain , olive oil and fresh wine . You must also give them the first wool you clip from your sheep .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	5	The Lord your God has chosen the Levites and their sons after them to serve him in his name always . He hasn ’ t chosen priests from any of your other tribes .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	6	Sometimes a Levite will move from the town in Israel where he ’ s living . And he will come to the place the Lord will choose . He ’ ll do it because he really wants to .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	7	Then he can serve in the name of the Lord his God . He ’ ll be like all the other Levites who serve the Lord there .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	8	He must have an equal share of the good things they have . That applies even if he has already received money by selling things his family owned . Practices the Lord Hates
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	9	You will enter the land the Lord your God is giving you . When you do , don ’ t copy the practices of the nations there . The Lord hates those practices .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	10	Here are things you must not do . Don ’ t sacrifice your children in the fire to other gods . Don ’ t practice any kind of evil magic at all . Don ’ t use magic to try to explain the meaning of warnings in the sky or of any other signs . Don ’ t take part in worshiping evil powers .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	11	Don ’ t put a spell on anyone . Don ’ t get messages from those who have died . Don ’ t talk to the spirits of the dead . Don ’ t get advice from the dead .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	12	The Lord your God hates it when anyone does these things . The nations in the land he ’ s giving you do these things he hates . So he will drive out those nations to make room for you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	13	You must be without blame in the sight of the Lord your God . The Prophet of the Lord
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	14	You will take over the nations that are in the land the Lord is giving you . They listen to those who practice all kinds of evil magic . But you belong to the Lord your God . He says you must not do these things .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	15	The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me . He will be one of your own people . You must listen to him .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	16	At Mount Horeb you asked the Lord your God for a prophet . You asked him on the day you gathered together . You said , “ We don ’ t want to hear the voice of the Lord our God . We don ’ t want to see this great fire anymore . If we do , we ’ ll die. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	17	The Lord said to me , “ What they are saying is good .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	19	The prophet will speak in my name . But someone might not listen to what I say through the prophet . I will hold that person responsible for not listening .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	20	But suppose a prophet dares to speak in my name something I have not commanded . Or he speaks in the name of other gods . Then that prophet must be put to death. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	21	You will say to yourselves , “ How can we know when a message hasn ’ t been spoken by the Lord ? ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	18	22	Sometimes a prophet will announce something in the name of the Lord . And it won ’ t take place or come true . Then that ’ s a message the Lord hasn ’ t told him to speak . That prophet has dared to speak on his own authority . So don ’ t be afraid of what he says . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	19	So do to the lying witness what he tried to do to the other person . Get rid of that evil witness .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	2	When you do , set apart for yourselves three cities in the land . It ’ s the land the Lord your God is giving you to take as your own .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	3	Figure out the distances and then separate the land into three parts . Then anyone who kills another person can run to one of these cities for safety . They are in the land the Lord your God is giving you as your own .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	4	Here is the rule about a person who kills someone . That person can run to one of those cities for safety . The rule applies to anyone who kills a neighbor they didn ’ t hate and didn ’ t mean to kill .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	5	For example , suppose a man goes into a forest with his neighbor to cut wood . When he swings his ax to chop down a tree , the head of the ax flies off . And it hits his neighbor and kills him . Then that man can run to one of those cities and save his life .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	6	If he doesn ’ t go to one of those cities , the dead man ’ s nearest male relative might become very angry . He might chase the man . If the city is too far away , he might catch him and kill him . But the man running to the city isn ’ t worthy of death , because he didn ’ t hate his neighbor .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	7	That ’ s why I command you to set apart for yourselves three cities .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	8	The Lord your God will increase the size of your territory . He promised your people of long ago that he would do it . He will give you the whole land he promised them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	9	But he ’ ll do it only if you are careful to obey all the laws I ’ m commanding you today . I command you to love the Lord your God . You must always live as he wants you to live . Suppose you are careful to obey , and the Lord your God gives you more land . Then you must set apart three more cities .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	10	Do it to protect those not guilty of murder . Then you won ’ t spill their blood in your land . It ’ s the land the Lord your God is giving you as your own .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	11	But suppose a man hates his neighbor . So he hides and waits for him . Then he attacks him and kills him . And he runs to one of those cities for safety .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	12	If he does , the elders of his own town must send for him . He must be brought back from the city . He must be handed over to the dead man ’ s nearest male relative . Then the relative will kill him .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	13	Don ’ t feel sorry for him . He has killed someone who hadn ’ t done anything wrong . Crimes like that must be punished in Israel . Then things will go well with you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	14	Don ’ t move your neighbor ’ s boundary stone . It was set up by people who lived there before you . It marks the border of a field in the land you will receive as your own . The Lord your God is giving you that land . You will take it over . Witnesses
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	15	Suppose someone is charged with committing a crime of any kind . Then one witness won ’ t be enough to prove that person is guilty . Every matter must be proved by the words of two or three witnesses .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	16	Suppose a witness who tells lies goes to court and brings charges against someone . The witness says someone committed a crime .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	17	Then the two people in the case must stand in front of the Lord . They must stand in front of the priests and the judges who are in office at that time .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	18	The judges must check out the matter carefully . And suppose the witness is proved to be lying . Then he has said something false in court against another Israelite .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	20	The rest of the people will hear about it . And they will be afraid . They won ’ t allow such an evil thing to be done among them again .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	19	21	Don ’ t feel sorry for that evil person . A life must be taken for a life . An eye must be put out for an eye . A tooth must be knocked out for a tooth . A hand must be cut off for a hand and a foot for a foot . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	2	Just before you go into battle , the priest will come forward . He ’ ll speak to the army .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	3	He ’ ll say , “ Men of Israel , listen to me . Today you are going into battle against your enemies . Don ’ t be scared . Don ’ t be afraid . Don ’ t panic or be terrified by them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	4	The Lord your God is going with you . He ’ ll fight for you . He ’ ll help you win the battle over your enemies. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	5	The officers will speak to the army . They will say , “ Has anyone built a new house and not started to live in it ? Let him go home . If he doesn ’ t , he might die in battle . Then someone else will live in his house .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	6	Has anyone planted a vineyard and not started to enjoy it ? Let him go home . If he doesn ’ t , he might die in battle . Then someone else will enjoy his vineyard .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	7	Has anyone promised to be married to a woman but hasn ’ t done it yet ? Let him go home . If he doesn ’ t , he might die in battle . Then someone else will marry her. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	8	The officers will continue , “ Is anyone afraid or scared ? Let him go home . Then the other soldiers won ’ t lose hope too. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	9	The officers will finish speaking to the army . When they do , they ’ ll appoint commanders over it .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	10	Suppose you march up to attack a city . Before you attack it , offer to make peace with its people .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	11	Suppose they accept your offer and open their gates . Then force all the people in the city to be your slaves . They will have to work for you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	12	But suppose they refuse your offer of peace and prepare for battle . Then surround that city . Get ready to attack it .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	13	The Lord your God will hand it over to you . When he does , kill all the men with your swords .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	14	But you can take the women and children for yourselves . You can also take the livestock and everything else in the city . What you have captured from your enemies you can use for yourselves . The Lord your God has given it to you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	15	That ’ s how you must treat all the cities far away from you . Those cities don ’ t belong to the nations that are nearby .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	16	But what about the cities the Lord your God is giving you as your own ? Kill everything that breathes in those cities .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	17	Completely destroy them . Wipe out the Hittites , Amorites , Canaanites , Perizzites , Hivites and Jebusites . That ’ s what the Lord your God commanded you to do .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	18	If you don ’ t destroy them , they ’ ll teach you to do all the things the Lord hates . He hates the way they worship their gods . If you do those things , you will sin against the Lord your God .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	20	19	Suppose you surround a city and get ready to attack it . And suppose you fight against it for a long time in order to capture it . Then don ’ t chop down its trees and destroy them . You can eat their fruit . So don ’ t cut them down . Are the trees people ? So why should you attack them ?

NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	21	Then all the people in his town will put him to death by throwing stones at him . Get rid of that evil person . All the Israelites will hear about it . And they will be afraid to disobey their parents . Several Other Laws
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	2	Then your elders and judges will go out to the field . They will measure the distance from the body to the nearby towns .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	3	The elders from the town that is nearest to the body will get a young cow . It must never have been used for work . It must never have pulled a load .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	4	The elders must lead it down into a valley . The valley must not have been farmed . There must be a stream flowing through it . There in the valley the elders must break the cow ’ s neck .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	5	The priests , who are sons of Levi , will step forward . The Lord your God has chosen them to serve him . He wants them to bless the people in his name . He wants them to decide all cases that have to do with people arguing and attacking others .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	6	Then all the elders from the town that is nearest to the body will wash their hands . They will wash them over the young cow whose neck they broke in the valley .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	7	They ’ ll say to the Lord , “ We didn ’ t kill that person . We didn ’ t see it happen .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	8	Accept this payment for the sin of your people Israel . Lord , you have set your people free . Don ’ t hold them guilty for spilling the blood of someone who hasn ’ t done anything wrong. ” That will pay for the death of that person .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	9	So you will get rid of the guilt of killing someone who didn ’ t do anything wrong . That ’ s because you have done what is right in the Lord ’ s eyes . Marrying a Woman Who Is Your Prisoner
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	10	Suppose you go to war against your enemies . And the Lord your God hands them over to you and you take them as prisoners .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	11	Then you notice a beautiful woman among them . If you like her , you may marry her .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	12	Bring her home . Have her shave her head and cut her nails .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	13	Have her throw away the clothes she was wearing when she was captured . Let her live in your house and mourn the loss of her parents for a full month . Then you can go to her and be her husband . And she will be your wife .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	14	But suppose you aren ’ t pleased with her . Then let her go where she wants to . You must not sell her . You must not treat her as a slave . You have already brought shame on her . The Rights of the Oldest Son
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	15	Suppose a man has two wives . He loves one but not the other . And both of them have sons by him . But the oldest son is the son of the wife the man doesn ’ t love .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	16	Someday he ’ ll leave his property to his sons . When he does , he must not give the rights of the oldest son to the son of the wife he loves . He must give those rights to his oldest son . He must do it even though his oldest son is the son of the wife he doesn ’ t love .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	17	He must recognize the full rights of the oldest son . He must do it , even though that son is the son of the wife he doesn ’ t love . He must give that son a double share of everything he has . That son is the first sign of his father ’ s strength . So the rights of the oldest son belong to him . A Stubborn Son
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	18	Suppose someone has a very stubborn son . He doesn ’ t obey his father and mother . And he won ’ t listen to them when they try to correct him .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	19	Then his parents will take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	20	They will say to the elders , “ This son of ours is very stubborn . He won ’ t obey us . He eats too much . He ’ s always getting drunk. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	22	Suppose someone is put to death for a crime worthy of death . And a pole is stuck through their body and set up where people can see it .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	21	23	Then you must not leave the body on the pole all night . Make sure you bury it that same day . Everyone who is hung on a pole is under God ’ s curse . You must not make the land “ unclean. ” The Lord your God is giving it to you as your own . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	22	5	A woman must not wear men ’ s clothes . And a man must not wear women ’ s clothes . The Lord your God hates it when anyone does this .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	22	6	Suppose you happen to find a bird ’ s nest beside the road . It might be in a tree or on the ground . And suppose the mother bird is sitting on her little birds or on the eggs . Then don ’ t take the mother along with the little ones .

NIRV	Deuteronomy	22	16	Her father will speak to the elders . He ’ ll say , “ I gave my daughter to this man to be his wife . But he doesn ’ t like her .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	22	17	So now he has told lies about her . He has said , ‘ I discovered that your daughter wasn ’ t a virgin. ’ But here ’ s the proof that my daughter was a virgin. ” Then her parents will show the elders of the town the cloth that has her blood on it .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	22	18	The elders will punish the man .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	22	19	They ’ ll make him weigh out two and a half pounds of silver . They ’ ll give it to the young woman ’ s father . That ’ s because the man has said an Israelite virgin is a bad woman . She will continue to be his wife . He must not divorce her as long as he lives .

NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	39	You will plant vineyards and take care of them . But you won ’ t drink the wine . You won ’ t gather the grapes . Worms will eat them up .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	40	You will have olive trees through your whole country . But you won ’ t use the oil . The olives will drop off the trees .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	41	You will have children . But you won ’ t be able to keep them . They ’ ll be taken away as prisoners .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	42	Large numbers of locusts will eat up the leaves on all your trees . They will also eat up the crops on your land .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	43	Outsiders who live among you will become your leaders . They will rise higher and higher . But you will sink lower and lower .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	44	They will lend money to you . But you won ’ t be able to lend money to them . They will be the leaders . But you will be the followers .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	45	The Lord your God will send all these curses on you . They will follow you everywhere . They ’ ll catch up with you . You will be under the Lord ’ s curse until you are destroyed . That ’ s because you didn ’ t obey him . You didn ’ t keep the commands and rules he gave you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	46	These curses will remain as signs and awful judgments against you and your children after you forever .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	47	You didn ’ t serve the Lord your God with joy and gladness when times were good .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	48	So he will send enemies against you . You will have to serve them . You will be hungry and thirsty . You will be naked and poor . The Lord will put the iron chains of slavery around your necks until he has destroyed you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	49	The Lord will bring a nation against you from far away . It will come from the ends of the earth . It will dive down on you like an eagle . You won ’ t understand that nation ’ s language .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	50	Its people will look mean . They won ’ t have any respect for old people . They won ’ t show any kindness to young people .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	51	They will eat up the young animals among your livestock . They ’ ll eat up the crops on your land . They ’ ll destroy you . They won ’ t leave you any grain , olive oil or fresh wine . They won ’ t leave you any calves or lambs . They ’ ll destroy you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	52	They ’ ll surround all the cities throughout your whole land . They ’ ll attack those cities until the high , strong walls you trust in fall down . That ’ s what will happen to the cities in the land the Lord your God is giving you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	53	Your enemies will surround you and attack you . They will make you suffer greatly . So you will eat your own children . You will eat the dead bodies of the sons and daughters the Lord your God has given you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	54	There may be a gentle and caring man among you . But he will treat his own brother badly . He ’ ll be just as mean to the wife he loves and to any of his children who are still alive .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	55	He won ’ t give to a single one of them any part of the dead bodies of his children that he ’ s eating . It will be all he has left to eat . That ’ s how much your enemies will make you suffer when they surround all your cities and attack them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	56	There may be a gentle and caring woman among you . She wouldn ’ t even touch the ground with her feet without first putting her sandals on . But she will not share anything with the husband she loves . She won ’ t share with her own children either .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	57	She will eat what comes out of her body after she has a baby . Then she ’ ll even eat her baby . She won ’ t share it with anyone in her family . In her great hunger she ’ ll plan to eat it in secret . There won ’ t be anything else for her to eat because the city she lives in will be surrounded . That ’ s an example of how much your enemies will make you suffer when they are attacking your cities .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	58	Be careful to follow all the words of this law . They are written in this scroll . Have respect for the glorious and wonderful name of the Lord your God . If you don ’ t ,
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	59	he will send terrible plagues on you and your children after you . He ’ ll send horrible and lasting troubles . He ’ ll make you very sick for a long time .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	60	He ’ ll bring on you all the sicknesses you were afraid of getting when you were in Egypt . You won ’ t be able to get rid of them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	61	The Lord will also bring on you all other kinds of sickness and trouble . I haven ’ t even written those down in this Book of the Law . You will be destroyed .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	62	At one time you were as many as the stars in the sky . But there will only be a few of you left . That ’ s because you didn ’ t obey the Lord your God .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	63	It pleased the Lord to give you success and to cause there to be many of you . But it will please him just as much to wipe you out and destroy you . You will be removed from the land you are entering to take as your own .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	64	Then the Lord will scatter you among all the nations . He ’ ll spread you around from one end of the earth to the other . There you will worship statues of gods made out of wood and stone . You and your people of long ago hadn ’ t known anything about those gods .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	65	Among those nations you won ’ t find any peace . There won ’ t be any place where you can make your home and rest your feet . The Lord will give you minds filled with worry . He ’ ll give you eyes worn out from looking for help . You won ’ t have any hope in your hearts .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	66	Your lives will always be in danger . You will be filled with fear night and day . You will never be sure you are safe .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	67	In the morning you will say , “ We wish it were evening ! ” In the evening you will say , “ We wish it were morning ! ” Your hearts will be filled with fear . The things you see will terrify you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	28	68	The Lord will send you back to Egypt in ships . He ’ ll send you on a journey I said you should never have to make again . You will offer to sell yourselves to your enemies as slaves in Egypt . But no one will buy you . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	29	The Lord our God keeps certain things hidden . But he makes other things known to us and to our children forever . He does it so we can obey all the words of this law . Copyright ©
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	2	Moses sent for all the Israelites . Here is what he said to them . With your own eyes you have seen everything the Lord did in Egypt to Pharaoh . You have seen what he did to all Pharaoh ’ s officials and to his whole land .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	3	With your own eyes you saw how the Lord really made them suffer . You saw the signs and amazing things he did .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	4	But to this day the Lord hasn ’ t given you a mind that understands . He hasn ’ t given you eyes that see . He hasn ’ t given you ears that hear .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	5	Yet the Lord says , “ I led you through the desert for
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	40	years . During that time your clothes didn ’ t wear out . The sandals on your feet didn ’ t wear out either .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	6	You didn ’ t eat any bread . You didn ’ t drink any kind of wine . I did all these things because I wanted you to know that I am the Lord your God. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	7	When you got here , Sihon and Og came out to fight against us . Sihon was the king of Heshbon . And Og was the king of Bashan . But we won the battle over them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	8	We took their land . We gave it to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh as their share .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	9	Be careful to obey the terms of this covenant . Then you will have success in everything you do .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	10	Today all of you are standing here in the sight of the Lord your God . Your leaders and chief men are here . Your elders and officials are here . So are all the other men of Israel .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	11	Your children and wives are here with you too . So are the outsiders living in your camps . They chop your wood and carry your water .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	12	All of you are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the Lord your God . He is making the covenant with you today . He ’ s giving you his word .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	13	Today he wants to show you that you are his people and that he is your God . That ’ s what he promised to Abraham , Isaac and Jacob .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	14	I ’ m making this covenant and the promise that goes along with it . I ’ m making this covenant with you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	15	You are standing here with us today in front of the Lord our God . And I ’ m also making this covenant with those who aren ’ t here today .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	16	You yourselves know how we lived in Egypt . You also know how we passed through other countries on the way here .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	17	You saw the statues of their gods made out of wood , stone , silver and gold . The Lord hates those statues .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	18	Make sure there isn ’ t a man or woman among your families or tribes who turns away from the Lord our God . No one must worship the gods of those nations . Make sure that kind of worship doesn ’ t spread like bitter poison through your whole community .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	19	Some people who worship those gods will hear the promise that seals the covenant I ’ m making . They think they can escape trouble by what they ’ re saying . They say , “ We ’ ll be safe , even though we ’ re stubborn and go our own way. ” But they will bring trouble on the whole land .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	20	The Lord will never be willing to forgive those people . His great anger will blaze out against them . All the curses I ’ ve written down in this book will fall on them . And the Lord will erase any mention of them from the earth .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	21	He will find those people in all the tribes of Israel and give them nothing but trouble . That will agree with all the curses of the covenant . They are written down in this Book of the Law .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	22	Even your children ’ s children will see the troubles that have fallen on the land . They ’ ll see the sicknesses the Lord has brought on it . People who come from countries far away will also see those things .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	23	The whole land will be burned up . Nothing but salt and sulfur will be left . Nothing will be planted there . Nothing will grow there . In fact , nothing will even start to grow there . The land will be like Sodom , Gomorrah , Admah and Zeboyim after they were destroyed . The Lord wiped out those cities because he was very angry .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	24	All the nations will ask , “ Why has the Lord done this to the land ? What could have made him so very angry ? ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	25	And they will hear the answer , “ It ’ s because the people living there have broken the covenant of the Lord . He ’ s the God of their people of long ago . He made that covenant with them when he brought them out of Egypt .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	26	They went off and worshiped other gods . They bowed down to them . They hadn ’ t known anything about those gods before . The Lord hadn ’ t given those gods to them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	27	So the Lord became very angry with this land . He brought on it all the curses written down in this book .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	29	28	The Lord ’ s anger blazed out against his people . So he pulled them up out of their land . He threw them into another land . And that ’ s where they are now. ”

NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	30	I have told you about all these blessings and curses . The Lord your God will bring them on you . Then you will think carefully about the blessings and curses . You will think about them everywhere the Lord your God scatters you among the nations .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	2	You and your children will return to the Lord your God . You will obey him with all your heart and with all your soul . That will be according to everything I ’ m commanding you today .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	3	When all that happens , the Lord your God will bless you with great success again . He will be very kind to you . He ’ ll bring you back from all the nations where he scattered you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	4	Suppose you have been forced to go away to the farthest land on earth . The Lord your God will bring you back even from there .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	5	He will bring you to the land that belonged to your people of long ago . You will take it over . He ’ ll make you better off than your people were . He ’ ll cause there to be more of you than there were of them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	6	The Lord your God will keep you from being stubborn . He ’ ll do the same thing for your children and their children . Then you will love him with all your heart and with all your soul . And you will live .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	7	The Lord your God will put all these curses on your enemies . They hated you and hunted you down .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	8	You will obey the Lord again . You will obey all his commands that I ’ m giving you today .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	9	Then the Lord your God will give you great success in everything you do . You will have many children . Your livestock will have many little ones . Your crops will do very well . The Lord will take delight in you again . He ’ ll give you success . That ’ s what he did for your people of long ago .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	10	But you must obey the Lord your God . You must keep his commands and rules . They are written in this Book of the Law . You must turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul . Choose Life , Not Death
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	11	What I ’ m commanding you today is not too hard for you . It isn ’ t beyond your reach .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	12	It isn ’ t up in heaven . So you don ’ t have to ask , “ Who will go up into heaven to get it ? Who will announce it to us so we can obey it ? ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	13	And it isn ’ t beyond the ocean . So you don ’ t have to ask , “ Who will go across the ocean to get it ? Who will announce it to us so we can obey it ? ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	14	No , the message isn ’ t far away at all . In fact , it ’ s really near you . It ’ s in your mouth and in your heart so that you can obey it .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	15	Today I ’ m giving you a choice . You can have life and success . Or you can have death and harm .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	16	I ’ m commanding you today to love the Lord your God . I ’ m commanding you to live exactly as he wants you to live . You must obey his commands , rules and laws . Then you will live . There will be many of you . The Lord your God will bless you in the land you are entering to take as your own .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	17	Don ’ t let your hearts turn away from the Lord . Instead , obey him . Don ’ t let yourselves be drawn away to other gods . And don ’ t bow down to them and worship them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	18	If you do , I announce to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed . You are about to go across the Jordan River and take over the land . But you won ’ t live there very long .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	19	I ’ m calling for the heavens and the earth to be witnesses against you this very day . I ’ m offering you the choice of life or death . You can choose either blessings or curses . But I want you to choose life . Then you and your children will live .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	30	20	And you will love the Lord your God . You will obey him . You will remain true to him . The Lord is your very life . He will give you many years in the land . He promised to give that land to your fathers , to Abraham , Isaac and Jacob . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	31	Here are the words Moses spoke to all the Israelites .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	2	He said , “ I am now
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	120	years old . I ’ m not able to lead you anymore . The Lord has said to me , ‘ You will not go across the Jordan River. ’
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	3	The Lord your God himself will go across ahead of you . He ’ ll destroy the nations there in order to make room for you . You will take over their land . Joshua will also go across ahead of you , just as the Lord said he would .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	4	The Lord will do to those nations what he did to Sihon and Og . He destroyed those Amorite kings along with their land .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	5	The Lord will hand those nations over to you . Then you must do to them everything I ’ ve commanded you to do .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	6	Be strong and brave . Don ’ t be afraid of them . Don ’ t be terrified because of them . The Lord your God will go with you . He will never leave you . He ’ ll never desert you. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	7	Then Moses sent for Joshua . Moses spoke to him in front of all the Israelites . He said , “ Be strong and brave . You must go with these people . They are going into the land the Lord promised to give to their people of long ago . You must divide it up among them . They will each receive their share .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	8	The Lord himself will go ahead of you . He will be with you . He will never leave you . He ’ ll never desert you . So don ’ t be afraid . Don ’ t lose hope. ” The Law Must Be Read to the People
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	9	Moses wrote down this law . He gave it to the priests , who are sons of Levi . They carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord . He also gave the law to all the elders of Israel .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	10	Then Moses commanded them , “ You must read this law at the end of every seven years . Do it in the year when you forgive people what they owe . Read it during the Feast of Booths .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	11	That ’ s when all the Israelites come to appear in front of the Lord your God at the holy tent . It will be at the place he will choose . You must read this law to them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	12	Gather the people together . Gather the men , women and children . Also bring together the outsiders living in your towns . Then they can listen and learn to have respect for the Lord your God . And they ’ ll be careful to obey all the words of this law .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	13	Their children must hear it read too . They don ’ t know this law yet . They too must learn to have respect for the Lord your God . They must honor him as long as you live in the land . You are about to go across the Jordan River and take that land as your very own. ” The Israelites Will Refuse to Obey the Lord
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	14	The Lord said to Moses , “ The day when you will die is near . Have Joshua go to the tent of meeting . Join him there . That is where I will appoint him as the new leader. ” So Joshua and Moses went to the tent of meeting .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	15	Then the Lord appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud . It stood over the entrance to the tent .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	16	The Lord spoke to Moses . He said , “ You are going to join the members of your family who have already died . The Israelites will not be faithful to me . They will soon join themselves to the false gods that are worshiped in the land they are entering . The people will desert me . They will break the covenant I made with them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	17	In that day I will become angry with them . I will desert them . I will turn my face away from them . And they will be destroyed . Many horrible troubles and hard times will come on them . On that day they will say , ‘ Trouble has come on us . Our God isn ’ t with us ! ’
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	18	I will certainly turn away from them on that day . I will do it because they did a very evil thing when they turned to other gods .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	19	“ I want you to write down a song and teach it to the Israelites . Have them sing it . It will be my witness against them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	20	I will bring them into a land that has plenty of milk and honey . I promised the land to their people of long ago . In that land they will eat until they have had enough . They will get fat . When they do , they will turn to other gods and worship them . They will turn their backs on me . They will break my covenant .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	21	Many horrible troubles and hard times will come on them . Then the song I am giving you will be a witness against them . That is because the song will not be forgotten by their children and their children ’ s children . I know what they are likely to do . I know it even before I bring them into the land I promised them. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	22	So that day Moses wrote the song down . And Moses taught it to the Israelites .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	23	The Lord gave a command to Joshua , the son of Nun . He said , “ Be strong and brave . You will bring the Israelites into the land I promised them . I myself will be with you. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	24	Moses finished writing the words of this law in a book . He wrote them down from beginning to end .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	25	Then he gave a command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord . Moses said ,
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	26	“ Take this Book of the Law . Place it beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God . It will remain there as a witness against you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	27	I know how you refuse to obey the Lord . I know how stubborn you are . You have refused to obey him while I ’ ve been living among you . So you will certainly refuse to obey him after I ’ m dead !
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	28	Gather together all the elders of your tribes and all your officials . Bring them to me . Then I can speak these words to them . I can call for the heavens and the earth to be witnesses against them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	29	I know that after I ’ m dead you will certainly become very sinful . You will turn away from the path I ’ ve commanded you to take . In days to come , trouble will fall on you . That ’ s because you will do what is evil in the sight of the Lord . You will make him very angry because of the statues of gods your hands have made. ” The Song of Moses
NIRV	Deuteronomy	31	30	Moses spoke the words of this song from beginning to end . The whole community of Israel heard them . Here is what he said . Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	32	Their vine comes from the vines of Sodom . It comes from the vineyards of Gomorrah . Their grapes are filled with poison . Their bunches of grapes taste bitter .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	2	Let my teaching fall like rain . Let my words come down like dew . Let them be like raindrops on new grass . Let them be like rain on tender plants .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	3	I will make known the name of the Lord . Praise God ! How great he is !
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	4	He is the Rock . His works are perfect . All his ways are right . He is faithful . He doesn ’ t do anything wrong . He is honest and fair .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	5	Israel , you have sinned against him very much . It ’ s too bad for you that you aren ’ t his children anymore . You have become a twisted and evil nation .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	6	Is that how you thank the Lord ? You aren ’ t wise . You are foolish . Remember , he ’ s your Father . He ’ s your Creator . He made you . He formed you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	7	Remember the days of long ago . Think about what the Lord did through those many years . Ask your father . He will tell you . Ask your elders . They ’ ll explain it to you .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	8	The Most High God gave the nations their lands . He divided up the human race . He set up borders for the nations . He did it based on the number of the angels in his heavenly court .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	9	The Lord ’ s people are his share . Jacob is the nation he has received .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	10	The Lord found Israel in a desert . He found them in an empty and windy land . He took care of them and kept them safe . He guarded them as he would guard his own eyes .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	11	He was like an eagle that stirs up its nest . It hovers over its little ones . It spreads out its wings to catch them . It carries them up in the air on its feathers .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	12	The Lord was the only one who led Israel . No other god was with them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	13	The Lord made them ride on the highest places in the land . He fed them what grew in the fields . He gave them the sweetest honey . He fed them olive oil from a rocky hillside .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	14	He gave them butter and milk from the herds and flocks . He fed them the fattest lambs and goats . He gave them the best of Bashan ’ s rams . He fed them the finest wheat . They drank the bubbling red juice of grapes .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	15	When Israel grew fat , they became stubborn . When they were filled with food , they became fat and heavy . They left the God who made them . They turned away from the Rock who saved them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	16	They made him jealous by serving false gods . They made him angry by worshiping statues of gods . He hated those gods .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	17	The people sacrificed to those false gods , not to God . They hadn ’ t known anything about those false gods . Those gods were new to them . Their people of long ago didn ’ t worship them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	18	But then they deserted the Rock . He was their Father . They forgot the God who created them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	19	When the Lord saw this , he turned away from them . His sons and daughters made him angry .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	20	“ I will turn my face away from them , ” he said . “ I will see what will happen to them in the end . They are sinful people . They are unfaithful children .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	21	They made me jealous by serving what is not even a god . They made me angry by worshiping worthless statues of gods . I will use people who are not a nation to make them jealous . A nation that has no understanding will make them angry .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	22	My anger will start a fire . It will burn all the way down to the kingdom of the dead . It will eat up the earth and its crops . It will set the base of the mountains on fire .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	23	“ I will pile troubles on my people . I will shoot all my arrows at them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	24	I will send them hunger . It will make them weak . I will send terrible sickness . I will send deadly plagues . I will send wild animals that will tear them apart . Snakes that glide through the dust will bite them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	25	In the streets their children will be killed by swords . Their homes will be filled with terror . The young men and women will die . The babies and old people will die .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	26	I said I would scatter them . I said I would erase their name from human memory .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	27	But I was afraid their enemies would make fun of that . I was afraid their attackers would not understand . I was sure they would say , ‘ We ’ re the ones who ’ ve beaten them ! The Lord isn ’ t the one who did it. ’ ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	28	Israel is a nation that doesn ’ t have any sense . They can ’ t understand anything .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	29	I wish they were wise . Then they would understand what ’ s coming . They ’ d realize what would happen to them in the end .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	30	How could one person chase a thousand ? How could two make ten thousand run away ? It couldn ’ t happen unless their Rock had deserted them . It couldn ’ t take place unless the Lord had given them up .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	31	Their rock is not like our Rock . Even our enemies know that .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	33	Their wine is like the poison of snakes . It ’ s like the deadly poison of cobras .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	34	The Lord says , “ I have kept all those terrible things stored away . I have kept them sealed up in my strongbox .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	35	I punish people . I will pay them back . The time will come when their feet will slip . Their day of trouble is near . Very soon they will be destroyed. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	36	The Lord will come to the aid of his people . He ’ ll show tender love to those who serve him . He will know when their strength is gone . He ’ ll see that no one at all is left .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	37	He ’ ll say , “ Where are their gods now ? Where is the rock they went to for safety ?
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	38	Where are the gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices ? Where are the gods who drank the wine of their drink offerings ? Let those gods rise up to help you ! Let them keep you safe !
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	39	“ Look ! I am the One ! There is no other God except me . I put some people to death . I bring others to life . I have wounded , and I will heal . No one can save you from my power .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	40	I raise my hand to heaven . Here is the promise I make . You can be sure that I live forever .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	41	And you can be just as sure that I will sharpen my flashing sword . My hand will hold it when I judge . I will get even with my enemies . I will pay back those who hate me .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	42	I will make my arrows drip with blood . My sword will destroy people . It will kill some . It will even kill prisoners . It will cut off the heads of enemy leaders. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	43	You nations , be full of joy . Be joyful together with God ’ s people . The Lord will get even with his enemies . He will pay them back for killing those who serve him . He will wipe away the sin of his land and people .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	44	Moses spoke all the words of this song to the people . Joshua , the son of Nun , was with him .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	45	Moses finished speaking all these words to all the Israelites .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	46	Then he said to them , “ Think carefully about all the words I have announced to you today . I want you to command your children to be careful to obey all the words of this law .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	47	They aren ’ t just useless words for you . They are your very life . If you obey them , you will live in the land for a long time . It ’ s the land you are going across the Jordan River to take as your own. ” Moses Will Die on Mount Nebo
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	48	On that same day the Lord said to Moses ,
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	49	“ Go up into the Abarim mountains . Go to Mount Nebo in Moab . It is across from Jericho . From there look out over Canaan . It is the land I am giving the Israelites to take as their own .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	50	You will die there on the mountain you have climbed . You will join the members of your family who have already died . In the same way , your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor . He joined the members of his family who had already died .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	51	You and Aaron disobeyed me in front of the Israelites . It happened at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin . You did not honor me among the Israelites as the holy God .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	32	52	So you will see the land , but only from far away . You will not enter the land I am giving to the Israelites. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	33	Here is the blessing that Moses , the man of God , gave to the Israelites before he died .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	2	He said , “ The Lord came from Mount Sinai . Like the rising sun , he shone on his people from Mount Seir . He shone on them from Mount Paran . He came with large numbers of angels . He came from his mountain slopes in the south .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	3	Lord , I ’ m sure you love your people . All the holy ones are in your hands . At your feet all of them bow down . And you teach them .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	4	They learn the law Moses gave us . It belongs to the community of the people of Jacob .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	5	The Lord was king over Israel when the leaders of the people came together . The tribes of Israel were also there. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	6	Here ’ s what Moses said about Reuben . “ Let Reuben live . Don ’ t let him die . And do not let his people be few. ”

NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	8	Here ’ s what Moses said about Levi . “ Your Thummim and Urim belong to your faithful servant . You tested him at Massah . You argued with him at the waters of Meribah .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	9	Levi didn ’ t show special favor to anyone . He did not spare his father and mother . He didn ’ t excuse his relatives or his children . But he watched over your word . He guarded your covenant .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	10	He teaches your rules to the people of Jacob . He teaches your law to Israel . He offers incense to you . He sacrifices whole burnt offerings on your altar .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	11	Lord , bless all his skills . Be pleased with everything he does . Destroy those who rise up against him . Strike down his enemies until they can ’ t get up. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	12	Here ’ s what Moses said about Benjamin . “ Let the one the Lord loves rest safely in him . The Lord guards him all day long . The one the Lord loves rests in his arms. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	13	Here ’ s what Moses said about Joseph . “ May the Lord bless Joseph ’ s land . May he bless it with dew from the highest heavens . May he bless it with water from the deepest oceans .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	14	May he bless it with the best crops the sun can produce . May he bless it with the finest crops the moon can give .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	15	May he bless it with the best products of the age-old mountains . May he bless it with the many crops of the ancient hills .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	16	May he bless it with the best gifts that fill the earth . May he bless it with the favor of the God who spoke out of the burning bush . Let all these blessings rest on the head of Joseph . Let them rest on the head of the one who is prince among his brothers .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	17	His glory is like the glory of a bull born first to its mother . His horns are like the horns of a wild ox . He will use them to destroy the nations . He ’ ll wipe out the nations that are very far away . The ten thousands of men in Ephraim ’ s army are like the bull and the ox . So are the thousands in the army of Manasseh. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	18	Here ’ s what Moses said about Zebulun and Issachar . “ Zebulun , be filled with joy when you go out . Issachar , be joyful in your tents .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	19	You will call for other people to go to the mountain . There you will offer the sacrifices of those who do what is right . You will enjoy the many good things your ships bring you . You will enjoy treasures that are hidden in the sand. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	20	Here ’ s what Moses said about Gad . “ May the God who gives Gad more land be praised ! Gad lives there like a lion that tears off arms and heads .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	21	He chose the best land for his livestock . The leader ’ s share was kept for him . The leaders of the people came together . Then Gad carried out the Lord ’ s holy plan . He carried out the Lord ’ s decisions for Israel. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	22	Here ’ s what Moses said about Dan . “ Dan is like a lion ’ s cub that charges out of the land of Bashan. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	23	Here ’ s what Moses said about Naphtali . “ The Lord greatly favors Naphtali . The Lord fills him with his blessing . Naphtali ’ s land will reach south to the Sea of Galilee. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	24	Here ’ s what Moses said about Asher . “ Asher is the most blessed of sons . Let his brothers be kind to him . Let Asher wash his feet with olive oil .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	25	The bars of his gates will be made out of iron and bronze . His strength will last as long as he lives .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	26	“ There is no one like the God of Israel . He rides across the heavens to help you . He rides on the clouds in his glory .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	27	God lives forever ! You can run to him for safety . His powerful arms are always there to carry you . He will drive out your enemies to make room for you . He ’ ll say to you , ‘ Destroy them ! ’
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	28	So Israel will live in safety . Jacob will live secure in a land that has grain and fresh wine . There the heavens drop their dew .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	33	29	Israel , how blessed you are ! Who is like you ? The Lord has saved you . He keeps you safe . He helps you . He ’ s like a glorious sword to you . Your enemies will bow down to you in fear . You will walk on the highest places of their lands. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Deuteronomy	34	34	Moses climbed Mount Nebo . He went up from the plains of Moab to the highest slopes of Pisgah . It ’ s across from Jericho . At Pisgah the Lord showed him the whole land from Gilead all the way to Dan .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	34	2	Moses saw the whole land of Naphtali . He saw the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh . The Lord showed him the whole land of Judah all the way to the Mediterranean Sea .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	34	3	Moses saw the Negev Desert . He saw the whole area from the Valley of Jericho all the way to Zoar . Jericho was also known as The City of Palm Trees .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	34	4	Then the Lord spoke to Moses . He said , “ This is the land I promised to Abraham , Isaac and Jacob . I told them , ‘ I will give this land to your children and their children. ’ Moses , I have let you see it with your own eyes . But you will not go across the Jordan River to enter it. ”
NIRV	Deuteronomy	34	5	Moses , the servant of the Lord , died there in Moab . It happened just as the Lord had said .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	34	6	The Lord buried the body of Moses in Moab . His grave is in the valley across from Beth Peor . But to this day no one knows where his grave is .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	34	7	Moses was
NIRV	Deuteronomy	34	120	years old when he died . But his eyesight was still good . He was still very strong .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	34	8	The Israelites mourned over Moses on the plains of Moab for
NIRV	Deuteronomy	34	30	days . They did it until their time for weeping and crying was over .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	34	9	Joshua , the son of Nun , was filled with wisdom . That ’ s because Moses had placed his hands on him . So the Israelites listened to Joshua . They did what the Lord had commanded Moses .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	34	10	Since then , Israel has never had a prophet like Moses . The Lord knew him face to face .
NIRV	Deuteronomy	34	11	Moses did many signs and amazing things . The Lord had sent him to do them in Egypt . Moses did them against Pharaoh , against all his officials and against his whole land .

NIRV	Joshua	1	1	Moses , the servant of the Lord , died . After that , the Lord spoke to Joshua , the son of Nun . Joshua was Moses ’ helper . The Lord said to Joshua ,
NIRV	Joshua	1	2	“ My servant Moses is dead . Now then , I want you and all these people to get ready to go across the Jordan River . I want all of you to go into the land I am about to give to the Israelites .
NIRV	Joshua	1	3	I will give all of you every place you walk on , just as I promised Moses .
NIRV	Joshua	1	4	Your territory will reach from the Negev Desert all the way to Lebanon . The great Euphrates River will be to the east . The Mediterranean Sea will be to the west . Your territory will include all the Hittite country .
NIRV	Joshua	1	5	Joshua , no one will be able to oppose you as long as you live . I will be with you , just as I was with Moses . I will never leave you . I will never desert you .
NIRV	Joshua	1	6	Be strong and brave . You will lead these people . They will take the land as their very own . It is the land I promised to give their people of long ago .
NIRV	Joshua	1	7	“ Be strong and very brave . Make sure you obey the whole law my servant Moses gave you . Do not turn away from it to the right or the left . Then you will have success everywhere you go .
NIRV	Joshua	1	8	Never stop reading this Book of the Law . Day and night you must think about what it says . Make sure you do everything written in it . Then things will go well with you . And you will have great success .
NIRV	Joshua	1	9	Here is what I am commanding you to do . Be strong and brave . Do not be afraid . Do not lose hope . I am the Lord your God . I will be with you everywhere you go. ”
NIRV	Joshua	1	10	So Joshua gave orders to the officers of the people . He said ,
NIRV	Joshua	1	11	“ Go through the camp . Tell the people , ‘ Get your supplies ready . Three days from now you will go across the Jordan River right here . You will go in and take over the land . The Lord your God is giving it to you as your very own. ’ ”
NIRV	Joshua	1	12	Joshua also spoke to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh . He said to them ,
NIRV	Joshua	1	13	“ Remember what Moses , the servant of the Lord , commanded you . He said , ‘ The Lord your God is giving you this land . It ’ s a place where you can make your homes and live in peace and rest. ’
NIRV	Joshua	1	14	Your wives , children and livestock can stay here east of the Jordan River . Moses gave you this land . But all your fighting men must get ready for battle . They must go across ahead of the other tribes . You must help them
NIRV	Joshua	1	15	until the Lord gives them rest . In the same way , he has already given you rest . You must help them until they also have taken over their land . It ’ s the land the Lord your God is giving them . After that , you can come back here . Then you can live in your own land . It ’ s the land that Moses , the servant of the Lord , gave you east of the Jordan River . It ’ s toward the sunrise. ”
NIRV	Joshua	1	16	Then the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh answered Joshua . They said , “ We ’ ll do what you have commanded us to do . We ’ ll go where you send us .
NIRV	Joshua	1	17	We obeyed Moses completely . And we ’ ll obey you just as completely . But may the Lord your God be with you , just as he was with Moses .
NIRV	Joshua	1	18	Suppose people question your authority . And suppose they refuse to obey anything you command them to do . Then they will be put to death . Just be strong and brave ! ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Joshua	2	2	The king of Jericho was told , “ Look ! Some of the Israelites have come here tonight . They ’ ve come to check out the land. ”
NIRV	Joshua	2	3	So the king sent a message to Rahab . It said , “ Bring out the men who came into your house . They ’ ve come to check out the whole land. ”
NIRV	Joshua	2	4	But the woman had hidden the two men . She said , “ It ’ s true that the men came here . But I didn ’ t know where they had come from .
NIRV	Joshua	2	5	They left at sunset , when it was time to close the city gate . I don ’ t know which way they went . Go after them quickly . You might catch up with them. ”
NIRV	Joshua	2	6	But in fact she had taken them up on the roof . There she had hidden them under some flax she had piled up .
NIRV	Joshua	2	7	The king ’ s men left to hunt down the spies . They took the road that leads to where the Jordan River can be crossed . As soon as they had gone out of the city , the gate was shut .
NIRV	Joshua	2	8	Rahab went up on the roof before the spies settled down for the night .
NIRV	Joshua	2	9	She said to them , “ I know that the Lord has given you this land . We are very much afraid of you . Everyone who lives in this country is weak with fear because of you .
NIRV	Joshua	2	10	We ’ ve heard how the Lord dried up the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt . We ’ ve heard what you did to Sihon and Og , the two Amorite kings . They ruled east of the Jordan River . You completely destroyed them .
NIRV	Joshua	2	11	When we heard about it , we were terrified . Because of you , we aren ’ t brave anymore . The Lord your God is the God who rules in heaven above and on the earth below .
NIRV	Joshua	2	12	“ Now then , please give me your word . Promise me in the name of the Lord that you will be kind to my family . I ’ ve been kind to you . Promise me
NIRV	Joshua	2	13	that you will spare the lives of my father and mother . Spare my brothers and sisters . Also spare everyone in their families . Promise that you won ’ t put any of us to death. ”
NIRV	Joshua	2	14	So the men made a promise to her . “ If you save our lives , we ’ ll save yours , ” they said . “ Just don ’ t tell anyone what we ’ re doing . Then we ’ ll be kind and faithful to you when the Lord gives us the land. ”
NIRV	Joshua	2	15	The house Rahab lived in was part of the city wall . So she let the spies down by a rope through the window .
NIRV	Joshua	2	16	She said to them , “ Go up into the hills . The men chasing you won ’ t be able to find you . Hide yourselves there for three days until they return . Then you can go on your way. ”
NIRV	Joshua	2	17	The spies had said to her , “ You made us give our word . But we won ’ t keep our promise
NIRV	Joshua	2	18	unless you do what we say . When we enter the land , you must tie this bright red rope in the window . Tie it in the window you let us down through . Bring your father and mother into your house . Also bring in your brothers and everyone else in your family .
NIRV	Joshua	2	19	None of you must go out into the street . If you do , anything that happens to you will be your own fault . We won ’ t be responsible . But if anyone hurts someone who is inside the house with you , it will be our fault . We will be responsible .
NIRV	Joshua	2	20	Don ’ t tell anyone what we ’ re doing . If you do , we won ’ t have to keep the promise you asked us to make. ”
NIRV	Joshua	2	21	“ I agree , ” Rahab replied . “ I ’ ll do as you say. ” So she sent them away , and they left . Then she tied the bright red rope in the window .
NIRV	Joshua	2	22	When the spies left , they went up into the hills . They stayed there for three days . By that time the men chasing them had searched all along the road . They couldn ’ t find them . So they returned .
NIRV	Joshua	2	23	Then the two spies started back . They went down out of the hills . They went across the Jordan River . They came to Joshua , the son of Nun . They told him everything that had happened to them .
NIRV	Joshua	2	24	They said , “ We ’ re sure the Lord has given the whole land over to us . All the people there are weak with fear because of us. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Joshua	3	3	They gave orders to the people . They said , “ Watch for the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God . The priests , who are Levites , will be carrying it . When you see it , you must move out from where you are and follow it .
NIRV	Joshua	3	2	After three days the officers went all through the camp .
NIRV	Joshua	3	4	Then you will know which way to go . You have never gone this way before . But don ’ t go near the ark . Stay about 1,000 yards away from it. ”
NIRV	Joshua	3	5	Joshua said to the people , “ Set yourselves apart to the Lord . Tomorrow he ’ ll do amazing things among you. ”
NIRV	Joshua	3	6	Joshua said to the priests , “ Go and get the ark of the covenant . Walk on ahead of the people. ” So they went and got it . Then they walked on ahead of them .
NIRV	Joshua	3	7	The Lord said to Joshua , “ Today I will begin to honor you in the eyes of all the Israelites . Then they will know that I am with you , just as I was with Moses .
NIRV	Joshua	3	8	Speak to the priests who carry the ark of the covenant . Tell them , ‘ When you reach the edge of the Jordan River , go into the water and stand there. ’ ”
NIRV	Joshua	3	9	Joshua said to the Israelites , “ Come here . Listen to what the Lord your God is saying .
NIRV	Joshua	3	10	You will soon know that the living God is among you . He will certainly drive out the people now living in the land . He ’ ll do it to make room for you . He ’ ll drive out the Canaanites , Hittites , Hivites , Perizzites , Girgashites , Amorites and Jebusites .
NIRV	Joshua	3	11	The ark will go into the Jordan River ahead of you . It ’ s the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth .
NIRV	Joshua	3	12	men from the tribes of Israel . Choose one from each tribe .
NIRV	Joshua	3	13	The priests will carry the ark of the Lord . He ’ s the Lord of the whole earth . As soon as the priests step into the Jordan , it will stop flowing . The water that ’ s coming down the river will pile up in one place . That ’ s how you will know that the living God is among you. ”
NIRV	Joshua	3	14	So the people took their tents down . They prepared to go across the Jordan River . The priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them .
NIRV	Joshua	3	15	The water of the Jordan was going over its banks . It always does that at the time the crops are being gathered . The priests came to the river . Their feet touched the water ’ s edge .
NIRV	Joshua	3	16	Right away the water coming down the river stopped flowing . It piled up far away at a town called Adam near Zarethan . The water flowing down to the Dead Sea was completely cut off . So the people went across the Jordan River opposite Jericho .
NIRV	Joshua	3	17	The priests carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord . They stopped in the middle of the river and stood on dry ground . They stayed there until the whole nation of Israel had gone across on dry ground . Copyright ©

NIRV	Joshua	4	4	So Joshua called together the
NIRV	Joshua	4	2	“ Choose
NIRV	Joshua	4	12	stones at Gilgal . They were the ones the people had taken out of the Jordan .
NIRV	Joshua	4	3	Tell them to get
NIRV	Joshua	4	5	He said to them , “ Go back to the middle of the Jordan River . Go to where the ark of the Lord your God is . Each one of you must pick up a stone . You must carry it on your shoulder . There will be as many stones as there are tribes in Israel .
NIRV	Joshua	4	6	The stones will serve as a reminder to you . In days to come , your children will ask you , ‘ What do these stones mean ? ’
NIRV	Joshua	4	7	Tell them that the Lord cut off the flow of water in the Jordan River . Tell them its water stopped flowing when the ark of the covenant of the Lord went across . The stones will always remind the Israelites of what happened there. ”
NIRV	Joshua	4	8	So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them . They took
NIRV	Joshua	4	9	Joshua also piled up
NIRV	Joshua	4	10	The priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan River . They stayed there until the people had done everything the Lord had commanded Joshua . It was just as Moses had directed Joshua . All the people went across quickly .
NIRV	Joshua	4	11	As soon as they did , the ark of the Lord and the priests also went across to the other side . The people were watching them .
NIRV	Joshua	4	13	There were about 40,000 of them . All of them were ready for battle . They went across in front of the ark of the Lord . They marched to the plains around Jericho . They were prepared to go to war .
NIRV	Joshua	4	14	That day the Lord honored Joshua in the eyes of all the Israelites . They had respect for Joshua as long as he lived . They respected him just as much as they had respected Moses .
NIRV	Joshua	4	15	Then the Lord spoke to Joshua . He said ,
NIRV	Joshua	4	16	“ Command the priests to come up out of the Jordan River . They are carrying the ark where the tablets of the covenant law are kept. ”
NIRV	Joshua	4	17	So Joshua gave a command to the priests . He said , “ Come up out of the Jordan River. ”
NIRV	Joshua	4	18	Then the priests came up out of the river . They were carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord . As soon as they stepped out on dry ground , the water of the Jordan began to flow again . It went over its banks , just as it had done before .
NIRV	Joshua	4	19	On the tenth day of the first month the people went up out of the Jordan River . They camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho .
NIRV	Joshua	4	20	Joshua set up the
NIRV	Joshua	4	21	Then he spoke to the Israelites . He said , “ In days to come , your children after you will ask their parents , ‘ What do these stones mean ? ’
NIRV	Joshua	4	22	Their parents must tell them , ‘ Israel went across the Jordan River on dry ground. ’
NIRV	Joshua	4	23	The Lord your God dried up the Jordan for you until you had gone across it . He did to the Jordan River the same thing he had done to the Red Sea . He dried up the Red Sea ahead of us until we had gone across it .
NIRV	Joshua	4	24	He did it so that all the nations on earth would know that he is powerful . He did it so that you would always have respect for the Lord your God. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Joshua	5	5	All the men who came out had been circumcised . But all the men born in the desert during the journey from Egypt hadn ’ t been circumcised .
NIRV	Joshua	5	2	At that time the Lord said to Joshua , “ Make knives out of flint . Use them to circumcise the men of Israel. ”
NIRV	Joshua	5	3	So Joshua made knives out of flint . Then he used them to circumcise the men of Israel at Gibeath Haaraloth .
NIRV	Joshua	5	4	Here is why Joshua circumcised them . All the men who came out of Egypt had died . They died while they were wandering through the Sinai Desert . They were the men old enough to serve in the army .
NIRV	Joshua	5	6	The Israelites had moved around in the desert for
NIRV	Joshua	5	40	years . By the end of that time all the men old enough to serve in the army when they left Egypt had died . That ’ s because they hadn ’ t obeyed the Lord . He had made a promise to them . He had told them they wouldn ’ t see the land . It ’ s the land he had promised to their people to give us . It ’ s a land that has plenty of milk and honey .
NIRV	Joshua	5	7	Because they hadn ’ t obeyed him , he raised up their sons to take their place . They were the ones Joshua circumcised . They hadn ’ t been circumcised yet . That ’ s because no one had circumcised them during the journey .
NIRV	Joshua	5	8	So Joshua circumcised all those men . The whole nation remained in the camp until the men were healed .
NIRV	Joshua	5	9	Then the Lord spoke to Joshua . He said , “ Today I have taken away from you the shame of being slaves in Egypt. ” That ’ s why the place where the men were circumcised has been called Gilgal to this very day .
NIRV	Joshua	5	10	The Israelites celebrated the Passover Feast . They observed it on the evening of the 14th day of the month . They did it while they were camped at Gilgal on the plains around Jericho .
NIRV	Joshua	5	11	The day after the Passover , they ate some of the food grown in the land . On that same day they ate grain that had been cooked . They also ate bread made without yeast .
NIRV	Joshua	5	12	The manna stopped coming down the day after they ate the food grown in the land . The Israelites didn ’ t have manna anymore . Instead , that year they ate food grown in Canaan . Israel Captures Jericho
NIRV	Joshua	5	13	When Joshua was near Jericho , he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him . The man was holding a sword . He was ready for battle . Joshua went up to him . He asked , “ Are you on our side ? Or are you on the side of our enemies ? ”
NIRV	Joshua	5	14	“ I am not on either side , ” he replied . “ I have come as the commander of the Lord ’ s army. ” Then Joshua fell with his face to the ground . He asked the man , “ What message does my Lord have for me ? ”
NIRV	Joshua	5	15	The commander of the Lord ’ s army replied , “ Take off your sandals . The place you are standing on is holy ground. ” So Joshua took them off . Copyright ©

NIRV	Joshua	6	2	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ I have handed Jericho over to you . I have also handed over to you its king and its fighting men .
NIRV	Joshua	6	3	March around the city once with all your fighting men . In fact , do it for six days .
NIRV	Joshua	6	4	Have seven priests get trumpets made out of rams ’ horns . They must carry them in front of the ark . On the seventh day , march around the city seven times . Tell the priests to blow the trumpets as you march .
NIRV	Joshua	6	5	You will hear them blow a long blast on the trumpets . When you do , tell the whole army to give a loud shout . The wall of the city will fall down . Then the whole army will march up to the city . Everyone will go straight in. ”
NIRV	Joshua	6	7	He gave an order to the army . He said , “ Move out ! March around the city . Some of the fighting men must march in front of the ark of the Lord. ”
NIRV	Joshua	6	8	When Joshua had spoken to the men , the seven priests went forward . They were carrying the seven trumpets as they marched in front of the ark of the Lord . They were blowing the trumpets . The ark of the Lord ’ s covenant was carried behind the priests .
NIRV	Joshua	6	9	Some of the fighting men marched ahead of the priests who were blowing the trumpets . The others followed behind the ark and guarded all the priests . That whole time the priests were blowing the trumpets .
NIRV	Joshua	6	10	But Joshua had given an order to the army . He had said , “ Don ’ t give a war cry . Don ’ t raise your voices . Don ’ t say a word until the day I tell you to shout . Then shout ! ”
NIRV	Joshua	6	11	So he had the ark of the Lord carried around the city once . Then the army returned to camp . They spent the night there .
NIRV	Joshua	6	12	Joshua got up early the next morning . The priests went and got the ark of the Lord .
NIRV	Joshua	6	13	The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets started out . They marched in front of the ark of the Lord . They blew the trumpets . Some of the fighting men marched ahead of them . The others followed behind the ark and guarded all of them . The priests kept blowing the trumpets .
NIRV	Joshua	6	14	On the second day they marched around the city once . Then the army returned to camp . They did all those things for six days .
NIRV	Joshua	6	15	On the seventh day , they got up at sunrise . They marched around the city , just as they had done before . But on that day they went around it seven times .
NIRV	Joshua	6	16	On the seventh time around , the priests blew a long blast on the trumpets . Then Joshua gave a command to the army . He said , “ Shout ! The Lord has given you the city !
NIRV	Joshua	6	17	The city and everything in it must be set apart to the Lord to be destroyed . But the prostitute Rahab and all those with her in her house must be spared . That ’ s because she hid the spies we sent .
NIRV	Joshua	6	18	But keep away from the things that have been set apart to the Lord . If you take any of them , you will be destroyed . And you will bring trouble on the camp of Israel . You will cause it to be destroyed .
NIRV	Joshua	6	19	All the silver and gold is holy . It is set apart to the Lord . So are all the things made out of bronze and iron . All those things must be added to the treasures kept in the Lord ’ s house. ”
NIRV	Joshua	6	20	The priests blew the trumpets . As soon as the army heard the sound , they gave a loud shout . Then the wall fell down . Everyone charged straight in . So they took the city .
NIRV	Joshua	6	21	They set it apart to the Lord to be destroyed . They destroyed every living thing in it with their swords . They killed men and women . They wiped out young people and old people . They destroyed cattle , sheep and donkeys .
NIRV	Joshua	6	22	Then Joshua spoke to the two men who had gone in to check out the land . He said , “ Go into the prostitute ’ s house . Bring her out . Also bring out everyone with her . That ’ s what you promised her you would do. ”
NIRV	Joshua	6	23	So the young men who had checked out the land went into Rahab ’ s house . They brought her out along with her parents and brothers and sisters . They brought out everyone else there with her . They put them in a place outside the camp of Israel .
NIRV	Joshua	6	24	Then they burned the whole city and everything in it . But they added the silver and gold to the treasures kept in the Lord ’ s house . They also put there the things made out of bronze and iron .
NIRV	Joshua	6	25	But Joshua spared the prostitute Rahab . He spared her family . He also spared everyone else in the house with her . He did it because she hid the spies he had sent to Jericho . Rahab lives among the Israelites to this day .
NIRV	Joshua	6	26	At that time Joshua made a promise and called down a curse . He said , “ May the person who tries to rebuild this city of Jericho be under the Lord ’ s curse . “ If that person lays its foundations , it will cost the life of his oldest son . If he sets up its gates , it will cost the life of his youngest son. ”
NIRV	Joshua	6	27	So the Lord was with Joshua . And Joshua became famous everywhere in the land . Copyright ©

NIRV	Joshua	7	7	Joshua said , “ Lord and King , why did you ever bring these people across the Jordan River ? Did you want to hand us over to the Amorites ? Did you want them to destroy us ? I wish we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan !
NIRV	Joshua	7	2	Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai . Ai is near Beth Aven east of Bethel . Joshua told the men , “ Go up and check out the area around Ai. ” So the men went up and checked it out .
NIRV	Joshua	7	3	Then they returned to Joshua . They said , “ The whole army doesn ’ t have to go up and attack Ai . Send only two or three thousand men . They can take the city . Don ’ t make the whole army go up there . Only a few people live in Ai. ”
NIRV	Joshua	7	4	So only about 3,000 troops went up . But the men of Ai drove them away .
NIRV	Joshua	7	5	They chased the Israelites from the city gate all the way to Shebarim . They killed about
NIRV	Joshua	7	36	of them on the way down . So the Israelites were terrified .
NIRV	Joshua	7	6	Joshua and the elders of Israel became sad . Joshua tore his clothes . He fell in front of the ark of the Lord with his face to the ground . He remained there until evening . The elders did the same thing . They also sprinkled dust on their heads .
NIRV	Joshua	7	8	Lord , our enemies have driven us away . What can I say ?
NIRV	Joshua	7	9	The Canaanites will hear about it . So will everyone else in the country . They will surround us . They ’ ll erase any mention of our name from the face of the earth . Then what will you do when people don ’ t honor your great name anymore ? ”
NIRV	Joshua	7	10	The Lord said to Joshua , “ Get up ! What are you doing down there on your face ?
NIRV	Joshua	7	11	Israel has sinned . I made a covenant with them . I commanded them to keep it . But they have broken it . They have taken some of the things that had been set apart to me in a special way to be destroyed . They have stolen . They have lied . They have taken the things they stole and have put them with their own things .
NIRV	Joshua	7	12	That is why the Israelites can ’ t stand up against their enemies . They turn their backs and run . That ’ s because I have decided to let them be destroyed . You must destroy the things you took that had been set apart to me . If you do not , I will not be with you anymore .
NIRV	Joshua	7	13	“ Go and set the people apart . Tell them , ‘ Make yourselves pure . Get ready for tomorrow . Here is what the Lord , the God of Israel , wants you to do . He says , “ People of Israel , you have kept some of the things that had been set apart to me to be destroyed . You can ’ t stand up against your enemies until you get rid of those things. ”
NIRV	Joshua	7	14	“ ‘ In the morning , come forward tribe by tribe . The tribe the Lord chooses will come forward group by group . The group the Lord chooses will come forward family by family . And the men in the family the Lord chooses will come forward one by one .
NIRV	Joshua	7	15	Whoever is caught with the things that had been set apart to the Lord will be destroyed by fire . Everything that belongs to that person will also be destroyed . He has broken the Lord ’ s covenant . He has done a very terrible thing in Israel ! ’ ”
NIRV	Joshua	7	16	Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes . The tribe of Judah was chosen .
NIRV	Joshua	7	17	The groups of Judah came forward . The group of Zerah was chosen . Joshua had the group of Zerah come forward by families . The family of Zimri was chosen .
NIRV	Joshua	7	18	He had their men come forward one by one . Achan was chosen . Achan was the son of Karmi . Karmi was the son of Zimri . And Zimri was the son of Zerah . Zerah was from the tribe of Judah .
NIRV	Joshua	7	19	Joshua said to Achan , “ My son , the Lord is the God of Israel . So give him glory and honor him by telling the truth ! Tell me what you have done . Don ’ t hide it from me. ”
NIRV	Joshua	7	20	ounces . I wanted them , so I took them . I hid them in the ground inside my tent . The silver is on the bottom. ”
NIRV	Joshua	7	21	I saw a beautiful robe from Babylonia among the things we had taken . I saw five pounds of silver . And I saw a gold bar that weighed
NIRV	Joshua	7	22	So Joshua sent some messengers . They ran to Achan ’ s tent . And there was everything , hidden in his tent ! The silver was on the bottom .
NIRV	Joshua	7	23	They brought the things out of the tent . They took them to Joshua and all the Israelites . And they spread them out in the sight of the Lord .
NIRV	Joshua	7	24	Then Joshua and all the people grabbed Achan , the son of Zerah . They took the silver , the robe and the gold bar . They took Achan ’ s sons and daughters . They took his cattle , donkeys and sheep . They also took his tent and everything he had . They carried all of it out to the Valley of Achor .
NIRV	Joshua	7	25	Joshua said to Achan , “ Why have you brought this trouble on us ? The Lord will bring trouble on you today. ” Then all the people killed Achan by throwing stones at him . They also killed the rest of his family with stones . They burned all of them up .
NIRV	Joshua	7	26	They placed a large pile of rocks on top of Achan ’ s body . The place has been called the Valley of Achor ever since . That pile is still there to this day . After the people killed Achan , the Lord was no longer angry with them . Copyright ©

NIRV	Joshua	8	8	When you have taken it , set it on fire . Do what the Lord has commanded . Make sure you obey my orders. ”
NIRV	Joshua	8	2	Remember what you did to Jericho and its king . You will do the same thing to Ai and its king . But this time you can keep for yourselves the livestock and everything else you take from them . Have some of your fighting men hide behind the city and take them by surprise. ”
NIRV	Joshua	8	3	So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai . He chose 30,000 of his best fighting men . He sent them out at night .
NIRV	Joshua	8	4	He gave them orders . He said , “ Listen carefully to what I ’ m saying . You must hide behind the city . Don ’ t go very far away from it . All of you must be ready to attack it .
NIRV	Joshua	8	5	I and all those with me will march up to the city . The men of Ai will come out to fight against us , just as they did before . Then we ’ ll run away from them .
NIRV	Joshua	8	6	They ’ ll chase us until we ’ ve drawn them away from the city . They ’ ll say , ‘ They are running away from us , just as they did before. ’ When we run away from them ,
NIRV	Joshua	8	7	come out of your hiding place . Capture the city . The Lord your God will hand it over to you .
NIRV	Joshua	8	9	Then Joshua sent them away . They went to the place where they had planned to hide . They hid in a place west of Ai . It was between Bethel and Ai . But Joshua spent that night with his troops .
NIRV	Joshua	8	10	Early the next morning Joshua brought together his army . He and the leaders of Israel marched in front of them to Ai .
NIRV	Joshua	8	11	The whole army that was with him marched up to the city . They stopped in front of it . They set up camp north of Ai . There was a valley between them and the city .
NIRV	Joshua	8	12	Joshua had chosen about 5,000 soldiers . He had ordered them to hide in a place west of Ai . It was between Bethel and Ai .
NIRV	Joshua	8	13	The men took up their battle positions . All the men in the camp north of the city took up their positions . So did those who were supposed to hide west of the city . That night Joshua went into the valley .
NIRV	Joshua	8	14	The king of Ai saw what the troops with Joshua were doing . So the king and all his men hurried out of the city early in the morning . They marched out to meet Israel in battle . They went to a place that looked out over the Arabah Valley . The king didn ’ t know that some of Israel ’ s fighting men were hiding behind the city .
NIRV	Joshua	8	15	Joshua and all his men let the men of Ai drive them back . The Israelites ran away toward the desert .
NIRV	Joshua	8	16	All the men of Ai were called out to chase them . They chased Joshua . So they were drawn away from the city .
NIRV	Joshua	8	17	Not even one man remained in Ai or Bethel . All of them went out to chase Israel . When they did , they left the city wide open .
NIRV	Joshua	8	18	Then the Lord said to Joshua , “ Hold out toward Ai the javelin that is in your hand . I will give the city to you. ” So Joshua held out toward the city the javelin in his hand .
NIRV	Joshua	8	19	As soon as he did , the men hiding behind the city got up quickly . They came out of their hiding places and rushed forward . They entered the city and captured it . They quickly set it on fire .
NIRV	Joshua	8	20	The men of Ai looked back . They saw smoke rising up from the city into the sky . But they couldn ’ t escape in any direction . The Israelites had been running away toward the desert . But now they turned around to face those chasing them .
NIRV	Joshua	8	21	Joshua and all his men saw that the men who had been hiding behind the city had captured it . They also saw that smoke was going up from it . So they turned around and attacked the men of Ai .
NIRV	Joshua	8	22	The men who had set Ai on fire came out of the city . They also fought against the men of Ai . So the men of Ai were caught in the middle . The army of Israel was on both sides of them . Israel struck them down . They didn ’ t let anyone remain alive or get away .
NIRV	Joshua	8	23	But they captured the king of Ai alive . They brought him to Joshua .
NIRV	Joshua	8	24	Israel finished killing all the men of Ai . They destroyed them in the fields and in the desert where they had chased them . They struck down every one of them with their swords . Then all the Israelites returned to Ai . And they killed those who were left in it .
NIRV	Joshua	8	25	The total number of men and women they killed that day was 12,000 . The Israelites put to death all the people of Ai .
NIRV	Joshua	8	26	Joshua continued to hold out his javelin toward Ai . He didn ’ t lower his hand until he and his men had totally destroyed everyone who lived there .
NIRV	Joshua	8	27	But this time Israel kept for themselves the livestock and everything else they had taken from the city . The Lord had directed Joshua to let them do it .
NIRV	Joshua	8	28	So Joshua burned down Ai . He tore it down so it could never be built again . It has been deserted to this very day .
NIRV	Joshua	8	29	Joshua killed the king of Ai . He stuck a pole through the body . Then he set it up where people could see it . He left it there until evening . At sunset , Joshua ordered his men to remove the body from the pole . He told them to throw the body down at the entrance of the city gate . They put a large pile of rocks over the body . That pile is still there to this day . Joshua Reads the Book of the Law to the People
NIRV	Joshua	8	30	Joshua built an altar to honor the Lord , the God of Israel . He built it on Mount Ebal .
NIRV	Joshua	8	31	Moses , the servant of the Lord , had commanded the Israelites to do that . Joshua built the altar according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses . Joshua built the altar out of stones that iron tools had never touched . Then the people offered on the altar burnt offerings to the Lord . They also sacrificed friendship offerings on it .
NIRV	Joshua	8	32	Joshua copied the law of Moses on stones . He did it while all the Israelites were watching .
NIRV	Joshua	8	33	They were standing on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the Lord . All the Israelites , including outsiders and citizens , were there . Israel ’ s elders , officials and judges were also there . All of them faced the priests , who were Levites . They were carrying the ark . Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim . The other half stood in front of Mount Ebal . Moses , the servant of the Lord , had earlier told them to do it . Moses told them to do it when he had given directions to bless the Israelites .
NIRV	Joshua	8	34	Then Joshua read all the words of the law out loud . He read the blessings and the curses . He read them just as they are written in the Book of the Law .
NIRV	Joshua	8	35	Joshua read every word Moses had commanded . He read them to the whole community of Israel . That included the women and children . It also included the outsiders living among them . Copyright ©

NIRV	Joshua	9	9	They answered , “ We ’ ve come from a country that ’ s very far away . We ’ ve come because the Lord your God is famous . We ’ ve heard reports about him . We ’ ve heard about everything he did in Egypt .
NIRV	Joshua	9	2	They brought their armies together to fight against Joshua and Israel .
NIRV	Joshua	9	3	The people of Gibeon heard about what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai .
NIRV	Joshua	9	4	So they decided to trick the Israelites . They packed supplies as if they were going on a long trip . They loaded their donkeys with old sacks and old wineskins . The wineskins were cracked but had been mended .
NIRV	Joshua	9	5	They put worn-out sandals on their feet . The sandals had been patched . They also wore old clothes . All the bread they took along was dry and moldy .
NIRV	Joshua	9	6	They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal . They spoke to him and the Israelites . They said , “ We ’ ve come from a country that ’ s far away . Make a peace treaty with us. ”
NIRV	Joshua	9	7	The Israelites said to the Hivites , “ But suppose you live close to us . If you do , we can ’ t make a peace treaty with you. ”
NIRV	Joshua	9	8	“ We ’ ll serve you , ” they said to Joshua . But Joshua asked , “ Who are you ? Where do you come from ? ”
NIRV	Joshua	9	10	We ’ ve heard about everything he did to Sihon and Og . They were the two kings of the Amorites . They ruled east of the Jordan River . Sihon was the king of Heshbon . Og was the king of Bashan . He ruled in Ashtaroth .
NIRV	Joshua	9	11	Our elders and all the people living in our country spoke to us . They said , ‘ Take supplies for your trip . Go and meet the Israelites . Say to them , “ We ’ ll serve you . Make a peace treaty with us. ” ’
NIRV	Joshua	9	12	Look at our bread . It was warm when we packed it . We packed it at home the day we left to come and see you . But look at how dry and moldy it is now .
NIRV	Joshua	9	13	When we filled these wineskins , they were new . But look at how cracked they are now . And our clothes and sandals are worn out because we ’ ve traveled so far. ”
NIRV	Joshua	9	14	The Israelites looked over the supplies those people had brought . But they didn ’ t ask the Lord what they should do .
NIRV	Joshua	9	15	Joshua made a peace treaty with the people who had come . He agreed to let them live . The leaders of the community gave their word that they agreed with the treaty .
NIRV	Joshua	9	16	So the Israelites made a peace treaty with the people of Gibeon . But three days later they heard that the people of Gibeon lived close to them .
NIRV	Joshua	9	17	So the Israelites started out to go to the cities of those people . On the third day they came to Gibeon , Kephirah , Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim .
NIRV	Joshua	9	18	But they didn ’ t attack those cities . That ’ s because the leaders of the community had given their word and made a peace treaty with them . They had given their word in the name of the Lord , the God of Israel . The whole community told the leaders they weren ’ t happy with them .
NIRV	Joshua	9	19	But all the leaders answered , “ We ’ ve made a peace treaty with them . We ’ ve given our word in the name of the Lord , the God of Israel . So we can ’ t touch them now .
NIRV	Joshua	9	20	But here is what we ’ ll do to them . We ’ ll let them live . Then the Lord won ’ t be angry with us because we didn ’ t keep our promise. ”
NIRV	Joshua	9	21	They continued , “ Let them live . But make them cut wood and carry water to serve the whole community. ” So the leaders kept their promise to them .
NIRV	Joshua	9	22	Joshua sent for the people of Gibeon . He said to them , “ Why did you trick us ? You said , ‘ We live far away from you. ’ But in fact you live close to us .
NIRV	Joshua	9	23	So now you are under a curse . You will always serve us . You will always cut wood and carry water for the house of my God. ”
NIRV	Joshua	9	24	They answered Joshua , “ We were clearly told what the Lord your God had commanded his servant Moses to do . He commanded him to give you the whole land . He also ordered him to wipe out all its people to make room for you . So we were afraid you would kill us . That ’ s why we tricked you .
NIRV	Joshua	9	25	We are now under your control . Do to us what you think is good and right. ”
NIRV	Joshua	9	26	So Joshua saved the people of Gibeon . He didn ’ t let the Israelites kill them .
NIRV	Joshua	9	27	That day he made them cut wood and carry water . They had to serve the community of Israel . They also had to do work connected with the altar of the Lord . The altar would be at the place the Lord would choose . And they still serve the Israelites to this day . Copyright ©

NIRV	Joshua	10	10	The Lord threw them into a panic as Israel marched toward them . Then Joshua and the Israelites won a complete victory over them at Gibeon . The Israelites chased them along the road that goes up to Beth Horon . They struck them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah .
NIRV	Joshua	10	2	The things he heard alarmed him and his people very much . That ’ s because Gibeon was an important city . It was like one of the royal cities . It was larger than Ai . All its men were good soldiers .
NIRV	Joshua	10	3	So Adoni-Zedek , the king of Jerusalem , made an appeal to Hoham , the king of Hebron . He appealed to Piram , the king of Jarmuth . He appealed to Japhia , the king of Lachish . He also made an appeal to Debir , the king of Eglon .
NIRV	Joshua	10	4	“ Come up and help me attack Gibeon , ” he said . “ Its people have made peace with Joshua and the Israelites. ”
NIRV	Joshua	10	5	Then the kings of Jerusalem , Hebron , Jarmuth , Lachish and Eglon gathered their armies together . Those five Amorite kings moved all their troops into position to fight against Gibeon . Then they attacked it .
NIRV	Joshua	10	6	Joshua was in the camp at Gilgal . The people of Gibeon sent a message to him there . They said , “ Don ’ t desert us . We serve you . Come up to us quickly ! Save us ! Help us ! All the Amorite kings from the central hill country have gathered their armies together to fight against us. ”
NIRV	Joshua	10	7	So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his whole army . The army included all his best fighting men .
NIRV	Joshua	10	8	The Lord said to Joshua , “ Do not be afraid of them . I have handed them over to you . Not one of them will be able to fight against you and win. ”
NIRV	Joshua	10	9	Joshua marched all night from Gilgal . He took the Amorite armies by surprise .
NIRV	Joshua	10	11	The Amorites tried to escape as Israel marched toward them . They ran down the road from Beth Horon to Azekah . Then the Lord threw large hailstones down on them . The hailstones killed more of them than the swords of the Israelites did .
NIRV	Joshua	10	12	So the Lord gave the Amorites over to Israel . On that day Joshua spoke to the Lord while the Israelites were listening . He said , “ Sun , stand still over Gibeon . And you , moon , stand still over the Valley of Aijalon. ”
NIRV	Joshua	10	13	So the sun stood still . The moon stopped . They didn ’ t move again until the nation won the battle over its enemies . You can read about it in the Book of Jashar . The sun stopped in the middle of the sky . It didn ’ t go down for about a full day .
NIRV	Joshua	10	14	There has never been a day like it before or since . It was a day when the Lord listened to a mere human being . Surely the Lord was fighting for Israel !
NIRV	Joshua	10	15	Joshua and his whole army returned to the camp at Gilgal . Joshua Kills the Five Amorite Kings
NIRV	Joshua	10	16	The five Amorite kings had run away . They had hidden in the cave at Makkedah .
NIRV	Joshua	10	17	Joshua was told that the five kings had been found . He was also told that they were hiding in the cave at Makkedah .
NIRV	Joshua	10	18	He said , “ Roll some large rocks up to the opening of the cave . Put some men there to guard it .
NIRV	Joshua	10	19	But keep on going ! Chase your enemies ! Attack them from behind . Don ’ t let them get back to their cities . The Lord your God has handed them over to you. ”
NIRV	Joshua	10	20	So Joshua and the men of Israel had complete victory over them . They killed almost every one of them . But a few escaped . They went back to their cities that had high walls around them .
NIRV	Joshua	10	21	Then Israel ’ s whole army returned safely to Joshua . He was in the camp at Makkedah . No one in the land dared to say anything against the Israelites .
NIRV	Joshua	10	22	Joshua said , “ Open up the cave . Bring those five kings out to me. ”
NIRV	Joshua	10	23	So Joshua ’ s men brought the kings out of the cave . They were the kings of Jerusalem , Hebron , Jarmuth , Lachish and Eglon .
NIRV	Joshua	10	24	The men brought them to Joshua . Then he sent for all the men of Israel . He spoke to the army commanders who had come with him . He said , “ Come here . Put your feet on the necks of these kings. ” So they came forward and placed their feet on the necks of the kings .
NIRV	Joshua	10	25	Joshua said to them , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Don ’ t lose hope . Be strong and brave . This is what the Lord will do to all the enemies you are going to fight. ”
NIRV	Joshua	10	26	Joshua put the five kings to death . He stuck a pole through each of their bodies . Then he set the poles up where people could see the bodies . He left them there until evening .
NIRV	Joshua	10	27	At sunset Joshua ordered his men to take down the bodies . So they took them down from the poles and threw them into the cave where the kings had been hiding . They placed large rocks at the opening of the cave . And the rocks are still there to this day . The Campaign Against the Cities in the South
NIRV	Joshua	10	28	That day Joshua captured Makkedah . He cut down its people and their king . He totally destroyed everyone in it . He didn ’ t leave anyone alive . He did to the king of Makkedah the same thing he had done to the king of Jericho .
NIRV	Joshua	10	29	Joshua moved on from Makkedah to Libnah . Israel ’ s whole army went with him . They attacked Libnah .
NIRV	Joshua	10	30	The Lord also handed that city and its king over to Israel . Joshua destroyed the city . He and his men killed everyone in it with their swords . He didn ’ t leave anyone alive there . He did to its king the same thing he had done to the king of Jericho .
NIRV	Joshua	10	31	Joshua moved on from Libnah to Lachish . Israel ’ s whole army went with him . The men took up their battle positions . Then Joshua attacked Lachish .
NIRV	Joshua	10	32	The Lord handed it over to Israel . Joshua captured the city on the second day of the battle . He destroyed the city . He and his men killed everyone in it with their swords . He had done the same thing to Libnah .
NIRV	Joshua	10	33	While all that was happening , Horam had come up to help Lachish . He was the king of Gezer . But Joshua won the battle over him and his army . No one was left alive .
NIRV	Joshua	10	34	Joshua moved on from Lachish to Eglon . Israel ’ s whole army went with him . They took up their battle positions . Then they attacked Eglon .
NIRV	Joshua	10	35	They captured it that same day . They totally destroyed everyone in it with their swords . They had done the same thing to Lachish .

NIRV	Joshua	17	17	Joshua spoke again to the people in Joseph ’ s family line . He said to the people of Ephraim and Manasseh , “ There are large numbers of you . And you are very powerful . You will have more than one piece of land .
NIRV	Joshua	17	2	So land was given to the rest of the people of Manasseh . It was given to the family groups of Abiezer , Helek , Asriel , Shechem , Hepher and Shemida . They were the other men in the family line of Manasseh , the son of Joseph . Those were their names by their family groups .
NIRV	Joshua	17	3	Makir was the son of Manasseh . Gilead was the son of Makir . Hepher was the son of Gilead . And Zelophehad was the son of Hepher . Zelophehad didn ’ t have any sons . He only had daughters . Their names were Mahlah , Noah , Hoglah , Milkah and Tirzah .
NIRV	Joshua	17	4	The daughters of Zelophehad went to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua , the son of Nun . They also went to the other leaders . They said , “ The Lord commanded Moses to give us our share of land among our male relatives. ” So Joshua gave them land along with their male relatives . That was according to what the Lord had commanded .
NIRV	Joshua	17	5	Manasseh ’ s share was made up of ten pieces of land . That land was in addition to Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan River .
NIRV	Joshua	17	6	So the five granddaughters of Hepher in the family line of Manasseh received land , just as the other five sons of Manasseh did . The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the family line of Manasseh .
NIRV	Joshua	17	7	The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to Mikmethath . Mikmethath was east of Shechem . The border ran south from Mikmethath . The people living at En Tappuah were inside the border .
NIRV	Joshua	17	8	Manasseh had the land around Tappuah . But the town of Tappuah itself was on the border of Manasseh ’ s land . It belonged to the people of Ephraim .
NIRV	Joshua	17	9	The border continued south to the Kanah Valley . Some of the towns that belonged to Ephraim were located among the towns of Manasseh . But the border of Manasseh was the north side of the valley . The border came to an end at the Mediterranean Sea .
NIRV	Joshua	17	10	The land on the south belonged to Ephraim . The land on the north belonged to Manasseh . The territory of Manasseh reached the Mediterranean Sea . The tribe of Asher was the border on the north . The tribe of Issachar was the border on the east .
NIRV	Joshua	17	11	Inside the land given to Issachar and Asher , the towns of Beth Shan and Ibleam belonged to Manasseh . The towns of Dor , Endor , Taanach and Megiddo and their people also belonged to Manasseh . Manasseh was given all those towns and the settlements around them . The third town in the list was also called Naphoth Dor .
NIRV	Joshua	17	12	But the people of Manasseh weren ’ t able to take over those towns . That ’ s because the Canaanites had made up their minds to live in that area .
NIRV	Joshua	17	13	The Israelites grew stronger . Then they forced the Canaanites to work hard for them . But they didn ’ t drive them out completely .
NIRV	Joshua	17	14	The people in the family line of Joseph spoke to Joshua . They said , “ Why have you given us only one share of the land to have as our own ? There are large numbers of us . The Lord has blessed us greatly. ”
NIRV	Joshua	17	15	“ That ’ s true , ” Joshua said . “ There are large numbers of you . And the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you . So go up into the forest . Clear out some land for yourselves in the territory of the Perizzites and Rephaites. ”
NIRV	Joshua	17	16	The people in Joseph ’ s family line replied , “ The hill country isn ’ t big enough for us . And all the Canaanites who live in the plains use chariots that have iron parts . They include the people of Beth Shan and its settlements . They also include the people who live in the Valley of Jezreel. ”
NIRV	Joshua	17	18	You will also have the central hill country . It ’ s covered with trees . Cut them down and clear the land . That whole land from one end to the other will belong to you . The Canaanites use chariots that have iron parts . And those people are strong . But you can drive them out. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Joshua	18	4	Appoint three men from each tribe . I ’ ll send them to map out the land . Then they ’ ll write a report about its features . The report will point out the share of land each tribe will receive . Then the men will return to me .
NIRV	Joshua	18	5	You must divide the land up into seven shares . Judah must remain in its territory in the south . The people in Joseph ’ s family line must remain in their territory in the north .
NIRV	Joshua	18	6	Write reports about the features of those seven shares of land . Bring them here to me . Then I ’ ll cast lots for you in the sight of the Lord our God .
NIRV	Joshua	18	7	But the Levites don ’ t get any share of your land . That ’ s because their share is to serve the Lord as priests . The tribes of Gad and Reuben and half of the tribe of Manasseh have already received their shares . They are on the east side of the Jordan River . Moses , the servant of the Lord , gave their shares to them. ”
NIRV	Joshua	18	8	The men started out on their way to map out the land . Joshua directed them , “ Go and map out the land . Write a report about its features . Then return to me . I ’ ll cast lots for you here at Shiloh in the sight of the Lord. ”

NIRV	Joshua	22	16	“ We ’ re speaking for the Lord ’ s whole community . How could you disobey the God of Israel like this ? How could you turn away from the Lord ? How could you disobey him by building an altar for yourselves ?
NIRV	Joshua	22	17	Don ’ t you remember how we sinned at Peor ? The Lord struck us with a plague because of what we did . Up to this day we ’ re still suffering because of that sin .
NIRV	Joshua	22	18	Are you turning away from the Lord now ? “ Suppose you disobey the Lord today . If you do , he ’ ll be angry with the whole community of Israel tomorrow .
NIRV	Joshua	22	19	If your own land is ‘ unclean , ’ come over to the Lord ’ s land . It ’ s where his holy tent stands . Share our land with us . But don ’ t disobey the Lord . Don ’ t turn against us by building an altar for yourselves . Don ’ t build any altar other than the altar of the Lord our God .
NIRV	Joshua	22	20	Remember what happened to Achan , the son of Zerah . Achan wasn ’ t faithful to the Lord . He took the things that had been set apart to the Lord in a special way to be destroyed . Didn ’ t the whole community of Israel experience the Lord ’ s anger ? Achan wasn ’ t the only one who died because of his sin. ”
NIRV	Joshua	22	21	Then the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh replied . They answered the leaders of the family groups of Israel .
NIRV	Joshua	22	23	Have we built our own altar so we can turn away from the Lord ? Have we built it to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings on it ? Have we built it to sacrifice friendship offerings on it ? If we have , may the Lord himself hold us accountable .
NIRV	Joshua	22	24	“ No ! We built it because we were afraid . Someday your children might speak to our children . We were afraid they might say , ‘ What do you have to do with the Lord ? What do you have to do with the God of Israel ?
NIRV	Joshua	22	25	The Lord has made the Jordan River a border between us and you . You people of Reuben ! You people of Gad ! You don ’ t have anything to do with the Lord. ’ If your children say that , they might cause our children to stop worshiping the Lord .
NIRV	Joshua	22	26	“ That ’ s why we said to ourselves , ‘ Let ’ s get ready and build an altar . But let ’ s not build it to offer burnt offerings or sacrifices on it. ’
NIRV	Joshua	22	27	So just the opposite is true . The altar will be a witness between us and you . It will be a witness between our children and yours after us . It will also be a witness that we will worship the Lord at his sacred tent . We ’ ll worship him there with our burnt offerings , sacrifices and friendship offerings . Then in days to come your children won ’ t be able to say to ours , ‘ You don ’ t have anything to do with the Lord. ’
NIRV	Joshua	22	28	“ So we said to ourselves , ‘ Suppose they say that to us sometime . Or suppose they say it to our children after us . Then we ’ ll answer , “ Look at this altar . It ’ s exactly like the Lord ’ s altar . Our people built it . They didn ’ t build it to offer burnt offerings and sacrifices on it . Instead , they built it to be a witness between us and you. ” ’
NIRV	Joshua	22	29	“ We would never refuse to obey the Lord . We would never turn away from him now . We wouldn ’ t build an altar to offer burnt offerings , grain offerings and sacrifices on it . We wouldn ’ t use any altar other than the altar of the Lord our God . That altar stands in front of his holy tent. ”
NIRV	Joshua	22	30	Phinehas the priest heard what the tribes of Reuben , Gad and Manasseh had to say . The leaders of the family groups of the community of Israel heard it too . All of them were pleased with what they heard .
NIRV	Joshua	22	31	Phinehas the priest spoke to the tribes of Reuben , Gad and Manasseh . Phinehas was the son of Eleazar . He said , “ Today we know that the Lord is with us . That ’ s because you have been faithful to him in this matter . Now you have saved the Israelites from the Lord ’ s anger against them. ”
NIRV	Joshua	22	32	Then Phinehas the priest , the son of Eleazar , returned to Canaan . So did the leaders . All of them went back from their meeting with the tribes of Reuben and Gad in Gilead . They brought a report back to the Israelites .
NIRV	Joshua	22	33	The people were glad to hear the report . They praised God . They didn ’ t talk anymore about going to war against the eastern tribes . And they didn ’ t talk anymore about destroying the country where the tribes of Reuben and Gad lived .
NIRV	Joshua	22	34	The tribes of Reuben and Gad gave the altar a name . They called it A Witness Between Us that the Lord is God . Copyright ©

NIRV	Joshua	23	23	A long time had passed . The Lord had given Israel peace and rest from all their enemies around them . By that time Joshua was very old .
NIRV	Joshua	23	2	So he sent for all the elders , leaders , judges and officials of Israel . He said to them , “ I ’ m very old .
NIRV	Joshua	23	3	You yourselves have seen everything the Lord your God has done . You have seen what he ’ s done to all these nations because of you . The Lord your God fought for you .
NIRV	Joshua	23	4	Remember how I ’ ve given you all the land of the nations that remain here . I ’ ve given each of your tribes a share of it . It ’ s the land of the nations I conquered . It ’ s between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea in the west .
NIRV	Joshua	23	5	The Lord your God himself will drive those nations out of your way . He will push them out to make room for you . You will take over their land , just as the Lord your God promised you .
NIRV	Joshua	23	6	“ Be very strong . Be careful to obey everything written in the Book of the Law of Moses . Don ’ t turn away from it to the right or the left .
NIRV	Joshua	23	7	Don ’ t have anything to do with the nations that remain among you . Don ’ t use the names of their gods for any reason at all . Don ’ t give your word and make promises in their names . You must not serve them . You must not bow down to them .
NIRV	Joshua	23	8	You must remain true to the Lord your God , just as you have done until now .
NIRV	Joshua	23	9	“ The Lord has driven out great and powerful nations to make room for you . To this day no one has been able to fight against you and win .
NIRV	Joshua	23	10	One of you can chase a thousand away . That ’ s because the Lord your God fights for you , just as he promised he would .
NIRV	Joshua	23	11	So be very careful to love the Lord your God .
NIRV	Joshua	23	12	“ But suppose you turn away from him . You mix with the people who are left alive in the nations that remain among you . Later , you and they get married to each other . And you do other kinds of things with them .
NIRV	Joshua	23	13	Then you can be sure of what the Lord your God will do . He won ’ t drive out those nations to make room for you anymore . Instead , they will become traps and snares for you . They will be like whips on your backs . They will be like thorns in your eyes . All that will continue until you are destroyed . It will continue until you are removed from this good land . It ’ s the land the Lord your God has given you .
NIRV	Joshua	23	14	“ Now I ’ m about to die , just as everyone else on earth does . The Lord your God has kept all the good promises he gave you . Every one of them has come true . Not one has failed to come true . And you know that with all your heart and soul .
NIRV	Joshua	23	15	Every good thing has come to pass that the Lord your God has promised you . So you know that he can also bring against you all the evil things he has warned you about . He ’ ll do it until he has destroyed you . He ’ ll do it until he has removed you from this good land . It ’ s the land he has given you .
NIRV	Joshua	23	16	Suppose you break the covenant the Lord your God made with you . He commanded you to obey it . But suppose you go and serve other gods . And you bow down to them . Then the Lord will be very angry with you . You will quickly be destroyed . You will be removed from the good land he has given you. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Joshua	24	24	Then the people said to Joshua , “ We will serve the Lord our God . We will obey him. ”
NIRV	Joshua	24	2	Joshua spoke to all the people . He said , “ The Lord is the God of Israel . He says , ‘ Long ago your people lived east of the Euphrates River . They worshiped other gods there . Your people included Terah . He was the father of Abraham and Nahor .
NIRV	Joshua	24	3	I took your father Abraham from the land east of the Euphrates . I led him all through Canaan . I gave him many children and grandchildren . I gave him Isaac .
NIRV	Joshua	24	4	To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau . I gave the hill country of Seir to Esau . But Jacob and his family went down to Egypt .
NIRV	Joshua	24	5	“ ‘ Then I sent Moses and Aaron . I made the people of Egypt suffer because of the plagues I sent on them . But I brought you out of Egypt .
NIRV	Joshua	24	6	When I brought your people out , they came to the Red Sea . The people of Egypt chased them with chariots and with men on horses . They chased them all the way to the sea .
NIRV	Joshua	24	7	But your people cried out to me for help . So I put darkness between you and the people of Egypt . I swept them into the sea . It completely covered them . Your own eyes saw what I did to them . After that , you lived in the desert for a long time .
NIRV	Joshua	24	8	“ ‘ I brought you to the land of the Amorites . They lived east of the Jordan River . They fought against you . But I handed them over to you . I destroyed them to make room for you . Then you took over their land .
NIRV	Joshua	24	9	Balak , the son of Zippor , prepared to fight against Israel . Balak was the king of Moab . He sent for Balaam , the son of Beor . Balak wanted Balaam to put a curse on you .
NIRV	Joshua	24	10	But I would not listen to Balaam ’ s curses . So he blessed you again and again . And I saved you from his power .
NIRV	Joshua	24	11	“ ‘ Then you went across the Jordan River . You came to Jericho . Its people fought against you . So did the Amorites , Perizzites , Canaanites , Hittites , Girgashites , Hivites and Jebusites . But I handed them over to you .
NIRV	Joshua	24	12	I sent hornets ahead of you . They drove your enemies out to make room for you . That included the two Amorite kings . You did not do that with your own swords and bows .
NIRV	Joshua	24	13	So I gave you a land you had never farmed . I gave you cities you had not built . You are now living in them . And you are eating the fruit of vineyards and olive trees you did not plant. ’
NIRV	Joshua	24	14	“ So have respect for the Lord . Serve him . Be completely faithful to him . Throw away the gods your people worshiped east of the Euphrates River and in Egypt . Serve the Lord .
NIRV	Joshua	24	15	But suppose you don ’ t want to serve him . Then choose for yourselves right now whom you will serve . You can choose the gods your people served east of the Euphrates River . Or you can serve the gods of the Amorites . After all , you are living in their land . But as for me and my family , we will serve the Lord. ”
NIRV	Joshua	24	16	Then the people answered Joshua , “ We would never desert the Lord ! We would never serve other gods !
NIRV	Joshua	24	17	The Lord our God himself brought us and our parents up out of Egypt . He brought us out of that land where we were slaves . With our own eyes , we saw those great signs he did . He kept us safe on our entire journey . He kept us safe as we traveled through all the nations .
NIRV	Joshua	24	18	He drove them out to make room for us . That included the Amorites . They also lived in the land . We too will serve the Lord . That ’ s because he is our God. ”
NIRV	Joshua	24	19	Joshua said to the people , “ You aren ’ t able to serve the Lord . He is a holy God . He is a jealous God . He won ’ t forgive you when you disobey him . He won ’ t forgive you when you sin against him .
NIRV	Joshua	24	20	Suppose you desert the Lord . Suppose you serve the gods that people in other lands serve . If you do , he will turn against you . He will bring trouble on you . He will destroy you , even though he has been good to you. ”
NIRV	Joshua	24	21	But the people said to Joshua , “ No ! We will serve the Lord. ”
NIRV	Joshua	24	22	Then Joshua said , “ You are witnesses against yourselves . You have said that you have chosen to serve the Lord. ” “ Yes . We are witnesses , ” they replied .
NIRV	Joshua	24	23	“ Now then , ” said Joshua , “ throw away the statues of the gods that are among you . People from other lands serve those gods . Give yourselves completely to the Lord . He is the God of Israel. ”
NIRV	Joshua	24	25	On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people . There at Shechem he reminded them of its rules and laws .
NIRV	Joshua	24	26	He recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God . Then he got a large stone . He set it up in Shechem under the oak tree . It was near the place that had been set apart for the Lord .
NIRV	Joshua	24	27	“ Look ! ” he said to all the people . “ This stone will be a witness against us . It has heard all the words the Lord has spoken to us . Suppose you aren ’ t faithful to your God . Then the stone will be a witness against you. ”
NIRV	Joshua	24	28	Joshua sent the people away . He sent all of them to their own shares of land . Joshua Is Buried in the Promised Land
NIRV	Joshua	24	29	Then Joshua , the servant of the Lord , died . He was the son of Nun . He was
NIRV	Joshua	24	110	years old when he died .
NIRV	Joshua	24	30	His people buried him at Timnath Serah on his own property . It ’ s north of Mount Gaash in the hill country of Ephraim .
NIRV	Joshua	24	31	Israel served the Lord as long as Joshua lived . They also served him as long as the elders lived . Those were the elders who lived longer than Joshua did . They had seen for themselves everything the Lord had done for Israel .
NIRV	Joshua	24	32	The Israelites had brought Joseph ’ s bones up from Egypt . They buried his bones at Shechem in the piece of land Jacob had bought . He had bought it from the sons of Hamor . He had paid
NIRV	Joshua	24	100	pieces of silver for it . Hamor was the father of Shechem . That piece of land became the share that belonged to Joseph ’ s children after him .
NIRV	Joshua	24	33	Aaron ’ s son Eleazar died . He was buried at Gibeah in the hill country of Ephraim . Gibeah had been given to Eleazar ’ s son Phinehas . Copyright ©

NIRV	Judges	1	1	Joshua died . After that , the Israelites spoke to the Lord . They asked him , “ Who of us will go up first and fight against the Canaanites ? ”
NIRV	Judges	1	2	The Lord answered , “ The tribe of Judah will go up . I have handed the land over to them. ”
NIRV	Judges	1	3	Then the men of Judah spoke to their fellow Israelites , the men of Simeon . They said , “ Come up with us . Come into the territory Joshua gave us . Help us fight against the Canaanites . Then we ’ ll go with you into your territory. ” So the men of Simeon went with them .
NIRV	Judges	1	4	When the men of Judah attacked , the Lord helped them . He handed the Canaanites and Perizzites over to them . They struck down 10,000 men at Bezek .
NIRV	Judges	1	5	The men of Judah found Adoni-Bezek there . They fought against him . They struck down the Canaanites and Perizzites .
NIRV	Judges	1	6	But Adoni-Bezek ran away . The men of Judah chased him and caught him . Then they cut off his thumbs and big toes .
NIRV	Judges	1	7	Adoni-Bezek said , “ I cut off the thumbs and big toes of
NIRV	Judges	1	70	kings . I made them pick up scraps under my table . Now God has paid me back for what I did to them. ” The men of Judah brought Adoni-Bezek to Jerusalem . That ’ s where he died .
NIRV	Judges	1	8	The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it . They set the city on fire . They killed its people with their swords .
NIRV	Judges	1	9	After that , the men of Judah went down to fight against some Canaanites . Those Canaanites were living in the central hill country . They also fought against those living in the Negev Desert and the western hills .
NIRV	Judges	1	10	Then the men of Judah marched out against the Canaanites living in Hebron . Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba . The men of Judah won the battle over Sheshai , Ahiman and Talmai .
NIRV	Judges	1	11	From Hebron they marched out against the people living in Debir . It used to be called Kiriath Sepher .
NIRV	Judges	1	12	Caleb said , “ I will give my daughter Aksah to be married . I ’ ll give her to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher. ”
NIRV	Judges	1	13	Othniel captured it . So Caleb gave his daughter Aksah to him to be his wife . Othniel was the son of Kenaz . He was Caleb ’ s younger brother .
NIRV	Judges	1	14	One day Aksah came to Othniel . She begged him to ask her father for a field . When she got off her donkey , Caleb asked her , “ What can I do for you ? ”
NIRV	Judges	1	15	She replied , “ Do me a special favor . You have given me some land in the Negev Desert . Give me springs of water also. ” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs .
NIRV	Judges	1	16	Moses ’ father-in-law was a Kenite . His family went up from Jericho . Jericho was also known as the City of Palm Trees . His family went up with the people of Judah to the Desert of Judah . They went there to live among its people . Those people were living in the Negev Desert near Arad .
NIRV	Judges	1	17	The men of Judah marched out with their fellow Israelites , the men of Simeon . They attacked the people of Canaan living in Zephath . They set the city apart to the Lord in a special way to be destroyed . That ’ s why the city was called Hormah .
NIRV	Judges	1	18	The men of Judah captured Gaza , Ashkelon and Ekron . They also captured the territory around each of those cities .
NIRV	Judges	1	19	The Lord was with the men of Judah . They took over the central hill country . But they weren ’ t able to drive the people out of the plains . That ’ s because those people used chariots that had some iron parts .
NIRV	Judges	1	20	Moses had promised to give Hebron to Caleb . So Hebron was given to Caleb . He drove the three sons of Anak out of it .
NIRV	Judges	1	21	But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites living in Jerusalem . So to this day they live there with the people of Benjamin .
NIRV	Judges	1	22	The tribes of Joseph attacked Bethel . The Lord was with them .
NIRV	Judges	1	23	They sent men to Bethel to check it out . It used to be called Luz .
NIRV	Judges	1	24	Those who were sent saw a man coming out of the city . They said to him , “ Show us how to get into the city . If you do , we ’ ll see that you are treated well. ”
NIRV	Judges	1	25	So he showed them how to get in . The men of Joseph killed the people in the city with their swords . But they spared the man from Bethel . They also spared his whole family .
NIRV	Judges	1	26	Then he went to the land of the Hittites . He built a city there . He called it Luz . That ’ s still its name to this day .
NIRV	Judges	1	27	But the tribe of Manasseh didn ’ t drive out the people of Beth Shan . They didn ’ t drive out the people of Taanach , Dor , Ibleam and Megiddo . And they didn ’ t drive out the people of the settlements that are around those cities either . That ’ s because the Canaanites had made up their minds to continue living in that land .
NIRV	Judges	1	28	Later , Israel became stronger . Then they forced the Canaanites to work hard for them . But Israel never drove them out completely .
NIRV	Judges	1	29	The tribe of Ephraim didn ’ t drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer . So the Canaanites continued to live there among them .
NIRV	Judges	1	30	The tribe of Zebulun didn ’ t drive out the Canaanites living in Kitron and Nahalol . So these Canaanites lived among them . But the people of Zebulun forced the Canaanites to work hard for them .
NIRV	Judges	1	31	The tribe of Asher didn ’ t drive out the people living in Akko and Sidon . They didn ’ t drive out the people of Ahlab , Akzib , Helbah , Aphek and Rehob .
NIRV	Judges	1	32	So the people of Asher lived among the Canaanites who were in the land .
NIRV	Judges	1	33	The tribe of Naphtali didn ’ t drive out the people living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath . So the people of Naphtali lived among the Canaanites who were in the land . The people of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were forced to work hard for them .
NIRV	Judges	1	34	The Amorites made the people of Dan stay in the central hill country . They didn ’ t let them come down into the plain .
NIRV	Judges	1	35	The Amorites made up their minds to stay in Mount Heres . They also stayed in Aijalon and Shaalbim . But the power of the tribes of Joseph grew . Then the Amorites were forced to work hard for them .
NIRV	Judges	1	36	The border of the Amorites started at Scorpion Pass . It went to Sela and even past it . Copyright ©

NIRV	Judges	2	2	So you must not make a covenant with the people of this land . Instead , you must tear down their altars. ’ But you have disobeyed me . Why did you do it ?
NIRV	Judges	2	3	I have said something else . I said , ‘ I will not drive out those people to make room for you . They and their gods will become traps for you. ’ ”
NIRV	Judges	2	4	The angel of the Lord spoke these things to all the Israelites . Then the people wept out loud .
NIRV	Judges	2	5	So that place was called Bokim . The people offered sacrifices there to the Lord . The People Disobey the Lord and Lose Their Battles
NIRV	Judges	2	6	Joshua sent the Israelites away . Then they went to take over the land . All of them went to their own shares of land .
NIRV	Judges	2	7	The people served the Lord as long as Joshua lived . They also served him as long as the elders lived . Those were the elders who lived longer than Joshua did . They had seen all the great things the Lord had done for Israel .
NIRV	Judges	2	8	Joshua , the servant of the Lord , died . He was the son of Nun . He was
NIRV	Judges	2	110	years old when he died .
NIRV	Judges	2	9	His people buried him on his own property at Timnath Heres . It ’ s north of Mount Gaash in the hill country of Ephraim .
NIRV	Judges	2	10	All the people of Joshua ’ s time joined the members of their families who had already died . Then those who were born after them grew up . They didn ’ t know the Lord and what he had done for Israel .
NIRV	Judges	2	11	The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . They served gods that were named Baal .
NIRV	Judges	2	12	They deserted the Lord , the God of their people . He had brought them out of Egypt . But now the Israelites served other gods and worshiped them . They served the gods of the nations that were around them . They made the Lord angry
NIRV	Judges	2	13	because they deserted him . They served Baal . They also served female gods that were named Ashtoreth .
NIRV	Judges	2	14	The Lord became angry with the Israelites . So he handed them over to robbers . The robbers stole everything from them . The Lord handed the Israelites over to their enemies all around them . Israel wasn ’ t able to fight against them anymore and win .
NIRV	Judges	2	15	When the Israelites went out to fight , the Lord ’ s power was against them . He let their enemies win the battle over them . The Lord had warned them that it would happen . And now they were suffering terribly .
NIRV	Judges	2	16	Then the Lord gave them leaders . The leaders saved them from the power of those robbers .
NIRV	Judges	2	17	But the people wouldn ’ t listen to their leaders . They weren ’ t faithful to the Lord . They served other gods and worshiped them . They didn ’ t obey the Lord ’ s commands as their people before them had done . They quickly turned away from the path their people had taken .
NIRV	Judges	2	18	When the Lord gave them a leader , he was with that leader . The Lord saved the people from the power of their enemies . He did it as long as the leader lived . The Lord felt very sorry for the people . They groaned because of what their enemies did to them . Their enemies treated them badly .
NIRV	Judges	2	19	But when the leader died , the people returned to their evil ways . The things they did were even more sinful than the things their people before them had done . They served other gods and worshiped them . They refused to give up their evil practices . They wouldn ’ t change their stubborn ways .
NIRV	Judges	2	20	So the Lord became very angry with the Israelites . He said , “ This nation has broken my covenant . I made it with their people of long ago . But this nation has not listened to me .
NIRV	Judges	2	21	Joshua left some nations in the land when he died . I will no longer drive out those nations to make room for Israel .
NIRV	Judges	2	22	I will use those nations to test Israel . I will see whether Israel will live the way I , the Lord , want them to . I will see whether they will be like their people of long ago . I will see whether they will follow my path. ”
NIRV	Judges	2	23	The Lord had let those nations remain in the land . He didn ’ t drive them out right away . He didn ’ t hand them over to Joshua . Copyright ©

NIRV	Judges	3	3	So he left the five rulers of the Philistines . He left the people of Canaan and the people of Sidon . He left the Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains . They lived in the area between Mount Baal Hermon and Lebo Hamath .
NIRV	Judges	3	2	He wanted to teach the men in Israel who had never been in battle before . He wanted them to learn how to fight .
NIRV	Judges	3	4	The Lord left those nations where they were to test the Israelites . He wanted to see whether they would obey his commands . He had given those commands through Moses to their people of long ago .
NIRV	Judges	3	5	So the Israelites lived among the Canaanites , Hittites , Amorites , Perizzites , Hivites and Jebusites .
NIRV	Judges	3	6	They married the daughters of those people . They gave their own daughters to the sons of those people . And they served the gods of those people . Othniel
NIRV	Judges	3	7	The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . They forgot the Lord their God . They served gods that were named Baal . They also served female gods that were named Asherah .
NIRV	Judges	3	8	So the Lord was very angry with Israel . He handed them over to the power of Cushan-Rishathaim , the king of Aram Naharaim . For eight years Israel was under his rule .
NIRV	Judges	3	9	They cried out to the Lord . Then he provided someone to save them . The man ’ s name was Othniel , the son of Kenaz . He was Caleb ’ s younger brother .
NIRV	Judges	3	10	The Spirit of the Lord came on Othniel . So he became Israel ’ s leader . He went to war . The Lord handed over to him Cushan-Rishathaim , the king of Aram . Othniel won the battle over him .
NIRV	Judges	3	11	So the land was at peace for
NIRV	Judges	3	40	years . Then Othniel , the son of Kenaz , died . Ehud
NIRV	Judges	3	12	Again the Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . So the Lord gave Eglon power over Israel . Eglon was the king of Moab .
NIRV	Judges	3	13	He got the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him . All of them came and attacked Israel . They captured Jericho . Jericho was also known as The City of Palm Trees .
NIRV	Judges	3	14	For
NIRV	Judges	3	18	After that , Ehud sent away those who had carried it .
NIRV	Judges	3	15	Again the Israelites cried out to the Lord . Then he provided someone to save them . The man ’ s name was Ehud , the son of Gera . Ehud was left-handed . He was from the tribe of Benjamin . The Israelites sent Ehud to Eglon , the king of Moab . They sent him to give the king what he required them to bring him .
NIRV	Judges	3	16	Ehud had made a sword that had two edges . It was about a foot and a half long . He tied it to his right leg under his clothes .
NIRV	Judges	3	17	Eglon , the king of Moab , was a very fat man . Ehud gave him the gift he had brought .
NIRV	Judges	3	19	When he came to the place where some statues of gods stood near Gilgal , Ehud went back to Eglon . He said , “ Your Majesty , I have a secret message for you. ” The king said to his attendants , “ Leave us ! ” And all his attendants left him .
NIRV	Judges	3	20	Then Ehud approached him . King Eglon was sitting alone in the upstairs room of his palace . Ehud said , “ I have a message from God for you. ” So the king got up from his seat .
NIRV	Judges	3	21	Then Ehud reached out his left hand . He pulled out the sword tied to his right leg . He stuck it into the king ’ s stomach .
NIRV	Judges	3	22	Even the handle sank in after the blade . Eglon sagged and fell to the floor . Ehud didn ’ t pull out the sword . And the fat closed over it .
NIRV	Judges	3	23	Ehud went out to the porch . He shut the doors of the upstairs room behind him . Then he locked them .
NIRV	Judges	3	24	After he had gone , the servants came . They found the doors of the upstairs room locked . They said , “ Eglon must be going to the toilet in the inside room of the palace. ”
NIRV	Judges	3	25	They waited for a long time . They waited so long they became worried . But the king still didn ’ t open the doors of the room . So they took a key and unlocked them . There they saw their king . He had fallen to the floor and was dead .
NIRV	Judges	3	26	While Eglon ’ s servants had been waiting , Ehud had gotten away . He passed by the statues of gods and escaped to Seirah .
NIRV	Judges	3	27	There in the hill country of Ephraim he blew a trumpet . Then he led the Israelites down from the hills .
NIRV	Judges	3	28	“ Follow me , ” Ehud ordered . “ The Lord has handed your enemy Moab over to you. ” So they followed him down . They took over the only places where people could go across the Jordan River to get to Moab . They didn ’ t let anyone go across .
NIRV	Judges	3	29	At that time they struck down about 10,000 men of Moab . All those men were strong and powerful . But not even one escaped .
NIRV	Judges	3	30	That day Moab was brought under the rule of Israel . So the land was at peace for
NIRV	Judges	3	80	years . Shamgar
NIRV	Judges	3	31	After Ehud , Shamgar became the next leader . He was the son of Anath . Shamgar struck down
NIRV	Judges	3	600	Philistines with a large , pointed stick used to drive oxen . He too saved Israel . Copyright ©

NIRV	Judges	4	4	Deborah was a prophet . She was the wife of Lappidoth . She was leading Israel at that time .
NIRV	Judges	4	2	So the Lord handed them over to the power of Jabin . He was a king in Canaan . He ruled in Hazor . The commander of his army was Sisera . He lived in Harosheth Haggoyim .
NIRV	Judges	4	3	Jabin used
NIRV	Judges	4	900	chariots that had some iron parts . He also gathered together all his men . He brought them from Harosheth Haggoyim to the Kishon River .
NIRV	Judges	4	20	“ Stand in the doorway of the tent , ” he told her . “ Someone might come by and ask you , ‘ Is anyone in there ? ’ If that happens , say ‘ No. ’ ”
NIRV	Judges	4	5	Under the Palm Tree of Deborah she served the people as their judge . That place was between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim . The Israelites went up to her there . They came to have her decide cases for them . She settled matters between them .
NIRV	Judges	4	6	Deborah sent for Barak . He was the son of Abinoam . Barak was from Kedesh in the land of Naphtali . Deborah said to Barak , “ The Lord , the God of Israel , is giving you a command . He says , ‘ Go ! Take 10,000 men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun with you . Then lead them up to Mount Tabor .
NIRV	Judges	4	7	I will lead Sisera into a trap . He is the commander of Jabin ’ s army . I will bring him , his chariots and his troops to the Kishon River . There I will hand him over to you. ’ ”
NIRV	Judges	4	8	Barak said to her , “ If you go with me , I ’ ll go . But if you don ’ t go with me , I won ’ t go. ”
NIRV	Judges	4	9	“ All right , ” Deborah said . “ I ’ ll go with you . But because of the way you are doing this , you won ’ t receive any honor . Instead , the Lord will hand Sisera over to a woman. ” So Deborah went to Kedesh with Barak .
NIRV	Judges	4	10	There he sent for men from Zebulun and Naphtali . And 10,000 men followed him into battle . Deborah also went with him .
NIRV	Judges	4	11	Heber , the Kenite , had left the other Kenites . They came from the family line of Hobab . He was the brother-in-law of Moses . Heber set up his tent by the large tree in Zaanannim near Kedesh .
NIRV	Judges	4	12	Sisera was told that Barak , the son of Abinoam , had gone up to Mount Tabor .
NIRV	Judges	4	13	So Sisera gathered together his
NIRV	Judges	4	14	Then Deborah said to Barak , “ Go ! Today the Lord will hand Sisera over to you . Hasn ’ t the Lord gone ahead of you ? ” So Barak went down Mount Tabor . His 10,000 men followed him .
NIRV	Judges	4	15	As Barak ’ s men marched out , the Lord drove Sisera away from the field of battle . The Lord scattered all of Sisera ’ s chariots . Barak ’ s men struck down Sisera ’ s army with their swords . Sisera got down from his chariot . He ran away on foot .
NIRV	Judges	4	16	Barak chased Sisera ’ s chariots and army . Barak chased them all the way to Harosheth Haggoyim . All of Sisera ’ s troops were killed by swords . Not even one was left .
NIRV	Judges	4	17	But Sisera ran away on foot . He ran to the tent of Jael . She was the wife of Heber , the Kenite . Sisera ran there because there was a treaty between Heber ’ s family and Jabin , the king of Hazor .
NIRV	Judges	4	18	Jael went out to meet Sisera . “ Come in , sir , ” she said . “ Come right in . Don ’ t be afraid. ” So he entered her tent . Then she covered him with a blanket .
NIRV	Judges	4	19	“ I ’ m thirsty , ” he said . “ Please give me some water. ” So Jael opened a bottle of milk . The bottle was made out of animal skin . She gave him a drink of milk . Then she covered him up again .
NIRV	Judges	4	21	But Heber ’ s wife Jael picked up a tent stake and a hammer . She went quietly over to Sisera . He was lying there , fast asleep . He was very tired . She drove the stake through his head right into the ground . So he died .
NIRV	Judges	4	22	Just then Barak came by because he was chasing Sisera . Jael went out to meet him . “ Come right in , ” she said . “ I ’ ll show you the man you are looking for. ” So he went in with her . Sisera was lying there with the stake through his head . He was dead .
NIRV	Judges	4	23	On that day God brought Jabin under Israel ’ s control . He was a king in Canaan .
NIRV	Judges	4	24	Israel ’ s power grew stronger and stronger against King Jabin . The Israelites became so strong that they destroyed him . Copyright ©

NIRV	Judges	5	5	The mountains shook because of the Lord . He was at Mount Sinai . They shook because of the Lord . He is the God of Israel .
NIRV	Judges	5	2	“ The princes in Israel lead the way . The people follow them just because they want to . When this happens , praise the Lord !
NIRV	Judges	5	3	“ Kings , hear this ! Rulers , listen ! I will sing to the Lord . I will praise the Lord in song . He is the God of Israel .
NIRV	Judges	5	4	“ Lord , you went out from Seir . You marched out from the land of Edom . The earth shook . The heavens poured . The clouds poured down their water .
NIRV	Judges	5	6	“ The main roads were deserted . So travelers used the winding paths . That happened in the days of Shamgar , the son of Anath . It happened in the days of Jael .
NIRV	Judges	5	7	Those who lived in the villages of Israel would not fight . They held back until I , Deborah , came . I came as a mother in Israel .
NIRV	Judges	5	8	War came to the city gates . Then God chose new leaders . But no shields or spears were seen anywhere . There weren ’ t any among 40,000 men in Israel .
NIRV	Judges	5	9	My heart is with the princes in Israel . It ’ s with the people who follow them just because they want to . Praise the Lord !
NIRV	Judges	5	10	“ Some of you ride on white donkeys . Some of you sit on your saddle blankets . Some of you walk along the road . Think about
NIRV	Judges	5	11	the voices of the singers at the watering places . They sing about the victories of the Lord . They sing about the victories of his people who live in Israel ’ s villages . “ The people of the Lord went down to the city gates .
NIRV	Judges	5	12	‘ Wake up , Deborah ! Wake up ! ’ they said . ‘ Wake up ! Wake up ! Begin to sing ! Barak , get up ! Son of Abinoam , capture your prisoners ! ’
NIRV	Judges	5	13	“ The nobles who were left came down . The people of the Lord came down to me against the powerful enemy .
NIRV	Judges	5	14	Some came from the part of Ephraim where some Amalekites lived . Some from Benjamin were with the people who followed Ephraim . Captains came down from Makir . Those who rule like commanders came down from Zebulun .
NIRV	Judges	5	15	The princes of Issachar were with Deborah . The men of Issachar were with Barak . They went into the valley under his command . In the territories of Reuben , men looked deeply into their hearts .
NIRV	Judges	5	16	Why did they stay among the sheep pens ? Why did they stay to hear shepherds whistling for the flocks ? In the territories of Reuben , men looked deeply into their hearts .
NIRV	Judges	5	17	Gilead stayed east of the Jordan River . Why did Dan stay near the ships ? The men of Asher remained on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea . They stayed in their safe harbors .
NIRV	Judges	5	18	The people of Zebulun put their very lives in danger . So did Naphtali on the hillside fields .
NIRV	Judges	5	19	“ Kings came and fought . The kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the streams of Megiddo . But they didn ’ t carry away any silver . They didn ’ t take anything at all .
NIRV	Judges	5	20	From the heavens the stars fought . From the sky they fought against Sisera .
NIRV	Judges	5	21	The Kishon River swept them away . The Kishon is a very old river . My spirit , march on ! Be strong !
NIRV	Judges	5	22	The hooves of the horses pounded like thunder . The powerful horses of our enemies galloped away .
NIRV	Judges	5	23	‘ Let Meroz be cursed , ’ said the angel of the Lord . ‘ Let bitter curses fall on its people . They did not come to help the Lord . They did not come to help him against our powerful enemies. ’
NIRV	Judges	5	24	“ May Jael be the most blessed woman of all . May the wife of Heber , the Kenite , be blessed . May she be the most blessed woman of all those who live in tents .
NIRV	Judges	5	25	Sisera asked for water . She gave him milk . In a bowl fit for nobles she brought him buttermilk .
NIRV	Judges	5	26	Her hand reached out for a tent stake . Her right hand reached for a hammer . She hit Sisera . She crushed his head . She drove the stake right through his head .
NIRV	Judges	5	27	He sank down . He fell at her feet . He was lying there . At her feet he sank down . He fell . He fell where he sank down . That ’ s where he died .
NIRV	Judges	5	28	“ Sisera ’ s mother looked out through the window . From behind the wooden screen she cried out . ‘ Why is his chariot taking so long to get here ? ’ she said . ‘ Why can ’ t I hear the noise of his chariots yet ? ’
NIRV	Judges	5	29	Her wisest ladies answer her . And here ’ s what she keeps saying to herself .
NIRV	Judges	5	30	She says , ‘ They must be finding riches to bring back . They must be dividing them up . Each man is getting a woman or two . They are giving colorful clothes to Sisera . The clothes are very beautiful . He will bring some for me to wear . The men must be finding many things to bring home. ’
NIRV	Judges	5	31	“ Lord , may all your enemies be destroyed . But may all who love you be like the morning sun . May they be like the sun when it shines the brightest. ” So the land was at peace for

NIRV	Judges	6	6	The Midianites made the Israelites very poor . So they cried out to the Lord for help .
NIRV	Judges	6	2	The Midianites treated the Israelites very badly . That ’ s why they made hiding places for themselves . They hid in holes in the mountains . They also hid in caves and in other safe places .
NIRV	Judges	6	3	Each year the people planted their crops . When they did , the Midianites came into the country and attacked it . So did the Amalekites and other tribes from the east .
NIRV	Judges	6	4	They camped on the land . They destroyed the crops all the way to Gaza . They didn ’ t spare any living thing for Israel . They didn ’ t spare sheep or cattle or donkeys .
NIRV	Judges	6	5	The Midianites came up with their livestock and tents . They came like huge numbers of locusts . It was impossible to count the men and their camels . They came into the land to destroy it .
NIRV	Judges	6	7	They cried out to the Lord because of what the Midianites had done .
NIRV	Judges	6	8	So he sent a prophet to Israel . The prophet said , “ The Lord is the God of Israel . He says , ‘ I brought you up out of Egypt . That is the land where you were slaves .
NIRV	Judges	6	9	I saved you from the power of the Egyptians . I saved you from all those who were treating you badly . I drove out the Canaanites to make room for you . I gave you their land .
NIRV	Judges	6	10	I said to you , “ I am the Lord your God . You are now living in the land of the Amorites . Do not worship their gods. ” But you have not listened to me. ’ ”
NIRV	Judges	6	11	The angel of the Lord came . He sat down under an oak tree in Ophrah . The tree belonged to Joash . He was from the family line of Abiezer . Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress at Ophrah . He was the son of Joash . Gideon was threshing in a winepress to hide the wheat from the Midianites .
NIRV	Judges	6	12	The angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon . He said , “ Mighty warrior , the Lord is with you. ”
NIRV	Judges	6	13	“ Pardon me , sir , ” Gideon replied , “ you say the Lord is with us . Then why has all this happened to us ? Where are all the wonderful things he has done ? Our people of long ago told us about them . They said , ‘ Didn ’ t the Lord bring us up out of Egypt ? ’ But now the Lord has deserted us . He has handed us over to Midian. ”
NIRV	Judges	6	14	The Lord turned to Gideon . He said to him , “ You are strong . Go and save Israel from the power of Midian . I am sending you. ”
NIRV	Judges	6	15	“ Pardon me , sir , ” Gideon replied , “ but how can I possibly save Israel ? My family group is the weakest in the tribe of Manasseh . And I ’ m the least important member of my family. ”
NIRV	Judges	6	16	The Lord answered , “ I will be with you . So you will strike down the Midianites . You will leave no one alive. ”
NIRV	Judges	6	17	Gideon replied , “ If you are pleased with me , give me a special sign . Then I ’ ll know that it ’ s really you talking to me .
NIRV	Judges	6	18	Please don ’ t go away until I come back . I ’ ll bring my offering and set it down in front of you. ” The Lord said , “ I will wait until you return. ”
NIRV	Judges	6	19	Gideon went inside and prepared a young goat . From
NIRV	Judges	6	36	Gideon said to God , “ You promised you would use me to save Israel .
NIRV	Judges	6	20	The angel of God said to Gideon , “ Take the meat and the bread . Place them on this rock . Then pour out the soup. ” So Gideon did it .
NIRV	Judges	6	21	The angel of the Lord had a walking stick in his hand . With the tip of the stick he touched the meat and the bread . Fire blazed out of the rock . It burned up the meat and the bread . Then the angel of the Lord disappeared .
NIRV	Judges	6	22	Gideon realized it was the angel of the Lord . He cried out , “ Oh no , my Lord and King , I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face ! ”
NIRV	Judges	6	23	But the Lord said to him , “ May peace be with you ! Do not be afraid . You are not going to die. ”
NIRV	Judges	6	24	So Gideon built an altar there to honor the Lord . He called it The Lord Is Peace . It still stands in Ophrah to this day . Ophrah is in the territory that belongs to the family line of Abiezer .
NIRV	Judges	6	25	That same night the Lord spoke to Gideon . He said , “ Get the second bull from your father ’ s herd . Get the one that is seven years old . Tear down the altar your father built to honor the god named Baal . Cut down the pole beside it . The pole is used to worship the female god named Asherah .
NIRV	Judges	6	26	Then build the right kind of altar . Build it to honor the Lord your God . Build it on top of this hill . Then use the wood from the Asherah pole you cut down . Sacrifice the second bull as a burnt offering. ”
NIRV	Judges	6	27	So Gideon went and got ten of his servants . He did just as the Lord had told him . But he was afraid of his family . He was also afraid of the people in the town . So he did everything at night instead of during the day .
NIRV	Judges	6	28	In the morning the people in the town got up . They saw that Baal ’ s altar had been torn down . The Asherah pole beside it had been cut down . And the second bull had been sacrificed on the new altar that had been built .
NIRV	Judges	6	29	They asked each other , “ Who did this ? ” They looked into the matter carefully . Someone told them , “ Gideon , the son of Joash , did it. ”
NIRV	Judges	6	30	The people in the town spoke to Joash . They ordered him , “ Bring your son out here . He must die . He has torn down Baal ’ s altar . He has cut down the Asherah pole beside it. ”
NIRV	Judges	6	31	But Joash replied to the angry crowd around him . He asked , “ Are you going to stand up for Baal ? Are you trying to save him ? Those who stand up for him will be put to death by morning ! Is Baal really a god ? If he is , he can stand up for himself when someone tears down his altar. ”
NIRV	Judges	6	32	That ’ s why they gave Gideon the name Jerub-Baal on that day . Gideon had torn down Baal ’ s altar . So they said , “ Let Baal take his stand against him. ”
NIRV	Judges	6	33	All the Midianites and Amalekites gathered their armies together . Other tribes from the east joined them . All of them went across the Jordan River . They camped in the Valley of Jezreel .
NIRV	Judges	6	34	Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Gideon . So Gideon blew a trumpet to send for the men of Abiezer . He told them to follow him .
NIRV	Judges	6	35	He sent messengers all through Manasseh ’ s territory . He called for the men of Manasseh to fight . He also sent messengers to the men of Asher , Zebulun and Naphtali . So all those men went up to join the others .
NIRV	Judges	6	37	Please do something for me . I ’ ll put a piece of wool on the threshing floor . Suppose dew is only on the wool tomorrow morning . And suppose the ground all around it is dry . Then I will know that you will use me to save Israel . I ’ ll know that your promise will come true. ”
NIRV	Judges	6	38	And that ’ s what happened . Gideon got up early the next day . He squeezed the dew out of the wool . The water filled a bowl .
NIRV	Judges	6	39	Then Gideon said to God , “ Don ’ t be angry with me . Let me ask you for just one more thing . Let me use the wool for one more test . But this time make the wool dry . And let the ground be covered with dew. ”
NIRV	Judges	6	40	So that night God did it . Only the wool was dry . The ground all around it was covered with dew . Copyright ©

NIRV	Judges	7	7	The Lord spoke to Gideon . He said , “ With the help of the
NIRV	Judges	7	2	The Lord said to Gideon , “ I want to hand Midian over to you . But you have too many men for me to do that . Then Israel might brag , ‘ My own strength has saved me. ’
NIRV	Judges	7	3	So here is what I want you to announce to the army . Tell them , ‘ Those who tremble with fear can turn back . They can leave Mount Gilead. ’ ” So 22,000 men left . But 10,000 remained .
NIRV	Judges	7	4	The Lord said to Gideon , “ There are still too many men . So take them down to the water . There I will reduce the number of them for you . If I say , ‘ This one will go with you , ’ he will go . But if I say , ‘ That one will not go with you , ’ he will not go. ”
NIRV	Judges	7	5	So Gideon took the men down to the water . There the Lord said to him , “ Some men will drink the way dogs do . They will lap up the water with their tongues . Separate them from those who get down on their knees to drink. ”
NIRV	Judges	7	6	Three hundred men brought up the water to their mouths with their hands . And they lapped it up the way dogs do . All the rest got down on their knees to drink .
NIRV	Judges	7	300	trumpets were blown , the Lord caused all the men in the enemy camp to start fighting one another . They attacked one another with their swords . The army ran away to Beth Shittah toward Zererah . They ran all the way to the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath .
NIRV	Judges	7	8	So Gideon sent those Israelites home . But he kept the
NIRV	Judges	7	9	During that night the Lord said to Gideon , “ Get up . Go down against the camp . I am going to hand it over to you .
NIRV	Judges	7	10	But what if you are afraid to attack ? Then go down to the camp with your servant Purah .
NIRV	Judges	7	11	Listen to what they are saying . After that , you will not be afraid to attack the camp. ” So Gideon and his servant Purah went down to the edge of the camp .
NIRV	Judges	7	12	The Midianites had set up their camp in the valley . So had the Amalekites and all the other tribes from the east . There were so many of them that they looked like huge numbers of locusts . Like the grains of sand on the seashore , their camels couldn ’ t be counted .
NIRV	Judges	7	13	Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend about his dream . “ I had a dream , ” he was saying . “ A round loaf of barley bread came rolling into the camp of Midian . It hit a tent with great force . The tent turned over and fell down flat. ”
NIRV	Judges	7	14	His friend replied , “ That can only be the sword of Gideon , the son of Joash . Gideon is from Israel . God has handed the Midianites over to him . He has given him the whole camp. ”
NIRV	Judges	7	15	Gideon heard the man explain what the dream meant . Then Gideon bowed down and worshiped . He returned to the camp of Israel . He called out , “ Get up ! The Lord has handed the Midianites over to you. ”
NIRV	Judges	7	16	Gideon separated the
NIRV	Judges	7	17	“ Watch me , ” he told them . “ Do what I do . I ’ ll go to the edge of the enemy camp . Then do exactly as I do .
NIRV	Judges	7	18	I and everyone with me will blow our trumpets . Then blow your trumpets from your positions all around the camp . And shout the battle cry , ‘ For the Lord and for Gideon ! ’ ”
NIRV	Judges	7	19	Gideon and the
NIRV	Judges	7	100	men with him reached the edge of the enemy camp . It was about ten o ’ clock at night . It was just after the guard had been changed . Gideon and his men blew their trumpets . They broke the jars that were in their hands .
NIRV	Judges	7	20	The three fighting groups blew their trumpets . They smashed their jars . They held their torches in their left hands . They held in their right hands the trumpets they were going to blow . Then they shouted the battle cry , “ A sword for the Lord and for Gideon ! ”
NIRV	Judges	7	21	Each man stayed in his position around the camp . But all the Midianites ran away in fear . They were crying out as they ran .
NIRV	Judges	7	22	When the
NIRV	Judges	7	23	Israelites from the tribes of Naphtali , Asher and all of Manasseh were called out . They chased the Midianites .
NIRV	Judges	7	24	Gideon sent messengers through the entire hill country of Ephraim . They said , “ Come on down against the Midianites . Take control of the waters of the Jordan River before they get there . Do it all the way to Beth Barah. ” So all the men of Ephraim were called out . They took control of the waters of the Jordan all the way to Beth Barah .
NIRV	Judges	7	25	They also captured Oreb and Zeeb . Those men were two of the Midianite leaders . The men of Ephraim killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb . They killed Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb . They chased the Midianites . And they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon . He was by the Jordan River . Copyright ©

NIRV	Judges	8	8	From there Gideon went up to Peniel . He asked its men for the same thing . But they answered as the men of Sukkoth had .
NIRV	Judges	8	2	But he answered them , “ What I ’ ve done isn ’ t anything compared to what you have done . Ephraim ’ s grapes have been gathered . Isn ’ t what is left over better than all the grapes that have been gathered from Abiezer ’ s vines ?
NIRV	Judges	8	3	God handed Oreb and Zeeb over to you . They were Midianite leaders . So what was I able to do compared to what you did ? ” After Gideon had said that , they didn ’ t feel angry with him anymore .
NIRV	Judges	8	4	Gideon and his
NIRV	Judges	8	300	men were very tired . But they kept on chasing their enemies . They came to the Jordan River and went across it .
NIRV	Judges	8	5	Gideon said to the men of Sukkoth , “ Give my troops some bread . They are worn out . And I ’ m still chasing Zebah and Zalmunna . They are the kings of Midian. ”
NIRV	Judges	8	6	But the officials of Sukkoth objected . They said , “ Have you already killed Zebah and Zalmunna ? Have you cut their hands off and brought them back to prove it ? If you haven ’ t , why should we give bread to your troops ? ”
NIRV	Judges	8	7	Gideon replied , “ The Lord will hand Zebah and Zalmunna over to me . When he does , I ’ ll tear your skin with thorns from desert bushes. ”
NIRV	Judges	8	9	So he said to the men of Peniel , “ I ’ ll be back after I ’ ve won the battle . Then I ’ ll tear down this tower. ”
NIRV	Judges	8	10	Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor . They had an army of about 15,000 men . That ’ s all that were left of the armies of the tribes from the east . About 120,000 men who carried swords had died in battle .
NIRV	Judges	8	11	Gideon went up the trail the people of the desert had made . It ran east of Nobah and Jogbehah . He attacked the army by surprise .
NIRV	Judges	8	12	Zebah and Zalmunna ran away . They were the two kings of Midian . Gideon chased them and captured them . He destroyed their whole army .
NIRV	Judges	8	13	Then Gideon , the son of Joash , returned from the battle . He came back through the Pass of Heres .
NIRV	Judges	8	14	He caught a young man from Sukkoth . He asked him about the elders of the town . The young man wrote down for him the names of Sukkoth ’ s
NIRV	Judges	8	77	officials .
NIRV	Judges	8	15	Then Gideon came and said to the men of Sukkoth , “ Here are Zebah and Zalmunna . You made fun of me because of them . You said , ‘ Have you already killed Zebah and Zalmunna ? Have you cut their hands off and brought them back to prove it ? If you haven ’ t , why should we give bread to your tired men ? ’ ”
NIRV	Judges	8	16	Gideon went and got the elders of the town . Then he taught the men of Sukkoth a lesson . He tore their skin with thorns from desert bushes .
NIRV	Judges	8	17	He also pulled down the tower at Peniel . He killed the men in the town .
NIRV	Judges	8	18	Then he spoke to Zebah and Zalmunna . He asked , “ What were the men like that you killed at Tabor ? ” “ Men like you , ” they answered . “ Each one walked as if he were a prince. ”
NIRV	Judges	8	19	Gideon replied , “ Those were my brothers . They were the sons of my own mother . You can be sure that the Lord lives . And you can be just as sure that if you had spared their lives , I wouldn ’ t kill you. ”
NIRV	Judges	8	20	Then Gideon turned to his oldest son Jether . He said , “ Kill them ! ” But Jether didn ’ t pull out his sword . He was only a boy . So he was afraid .
NIRV	Judges	8	21	Zebah and Zalmunna said , “ Come on . Do it yourself . ‘ The older the man , the stronger he is. ’ ” So Gideon stepped forward and killed them . Then he took the gold chains off the necks of their camels . Gideon 's Linen Apron
NIRV	Judges	8	22	The Israelites said to Gideon , “ Rule over us . We want you , your son and your grandson to be our rulers . You have saved us from the power of Midian. ”
NIRV	Judges	8	23	But Gideon told them , “ I will not rule over you . My son won ’ t rule over you either . The Lord will rule over you. ”
NIRV	Judges	8	24	He continued , “ I do ask one thing . I want each of you to give me an earring . I ’ m talking about the earrings you took from your enemies. ” It was the practice of the people in the family line of Ishmael to wear gold earrings .
NIRV	Judges	8	25	The Israelites said , “ We ’ ll be glad to give them to you. ” So they spread out a piece of clothing . Each of them threw a ring on it from what he had taken .
NIRV	Judges	8	26	The weight of the gold rings Gideon asked for was
NIRV	Judges	8	43	pounds . That didn ’ t include the moon-shaped necklaces the kings of Midian had worn . It didn ’ t include their other necklaces or their purple clothes . And it didn ’ t include the gold chains that had been on the necks of their camels .
NIRV	Judges	8	27	Gideon made an object out of all the gold . It looked like the linen apron the high priest of Israel wore . Gideon placed it in Ophrah . That was his hometown . All the Israelites worshiped it there . They weren ’ t faithful to the Lord . So the gold object became a trap to Gideon and his family . Gideon Dies
NIRV	Judges	8	28	Israel brought Midian under their control . Midian wasn ’ t able to attack Israel anymore . So the land was at peace for
NIRV	Judges	8	40	years . The peace lasted as long as Gideon was living .
NIRV	Judges	8	29	Jerub-Baal , the son of Joash , went back home to live . Jerub-Baal was another name for Gideon .
NIRV	Judges	8	30	He had
NIRV	Judges	8	70	sons of his own . That ’ s because he had many wives .
NIRV	Judges	8	31	And he had a concubine who lived in Shechem . She also had a son by him . Gideon named that son Abimelek .
NIRV	Judges	8	32	Gideon , the son of Joash , died when he was very old . He was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah . Ophrah was in the territory that belonged to the family line of Abiezer .
NIRV	Judges	8	33	As soon as Gideon had died , the Israelites began serving and worshiping gods that were named Baal . Israel wasn ’ t faithful to the Lord . They worshiped Baal-Berith as their god .
NIRV	Judges	8	34	They forgot what the Lord their God had done for them . He had saved them from the power of their enemies all around them .
NIRV	Judges	8	35	Jerub-Baal had done many good things for the Israelites . But they weren ’ t faithful to his family . Jerub-Baal was another name for Gideon . Copyright ©

NIRV	Judges	9	9	“ But the olive tree answered , ‘ Should I give up my olive oil ? It ’ s used to honor gods and people alike . Should I give that up just to rule over the trees ? ’
NIRV	Judges	9	2	“ Speak to all the citizens of Shechem . Tell them , ‘ You can have all
NIRV	Judges	9	70	brothers .
NIRV	Judges	9	3	The brothers told all of that to the citizens of Shechem . Then the people decided to follow Abimelek . They said , “ He ’ s related to us. ”
NIRV	Judges	9	4	They gave him
NIRV	Judges	9	28	Then Gaal , the son of Ebed , said , “ Who is Abimelek ? And who is Shechem ? Why should we citizens of Shechem be under Abimelek ’ s rule ? Isn ’ t he Jerub-Baal ’ s son ? Isn ’ t Zebul his helper ? It would be better to serve the family of Hamor . He was the father of Shechem . So why should we serve Abimelek ?
NIRV	Judges	9	5	Abimelek went to his father ’ s home in Ophrah . There on a big rock he murdered his
NIRV	Judges	9	6	All the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo came together . They gathered at the stone pillar that was beside the large tree in Shechem . They wanted to crown Abimelek as their king .
NIRV	Judges	9	7	Jotham was told about it . So he climbed up on top of Mount Gerizim . He shouted down to them , “ Citizens of Shechem ! Listen to me ! Then God will listen to you .
NIRV	Judges	9	8	One day the trees went out to anoint a king for themselves . They said to an olive tree , ‘ Be our king. ’
NIRV	Judges	9	10	“ Next , the trees said to a fig tree , ‘ Come and be our king. ’
NIRV	Judges	9	11	“ But the fig tree replied , ‘ Should I give up my fruit ? It ’ s so good and sweet . Should I give that up just to rule over the trees ? ’
NIRV	Judges	9	12	“ Then the trees said to a vine , ‘ Come and be our king. ’
NIRV	Judges	9	13	“ But the vine answered , ‘ Should I give up my wine ? It cheers up gods and people alike . Should I give that up just to rule over the trees ? ’
NIRV	Judges	9	14	“ Finally , all the trees spoke to a bush that had thorns . They said , ‘ Come and be our king. ’
NIRV	Judges	9	15	“ The bush asked the trees , ‘ Do you really want to anoint me as king over you ? If you do , come and rest in my shade . But if you don ’ t , I will destroy you ! Fire will come out of me and burn up the cedar trees of Lebanon ! ’
NIRV	Judges	9	16	“ Did you act in an honest way when you made Abimelek your king ? Did you really do the right thing ? Have you been fair to Jerub-Baal and his family ? Have you given him the honor he ’ s worthy of ?
NIRV	Judges	9	17	Remember that my father fought for you . He put his life in danger for you . He saved you from the power of Midian .
NIRV	Judges	9	18	But today you have turned against my father ’ s family . You have murdered his
NIRV	Judges	9	19	Have you citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo acted in an honest way toward Jerub-Baal ? Have you done the right thing to his family today ? If you have , may you be happy with Abimelek ! And may he be happy with you !
NIRV	Judges	9	20	But if you haven ’ t , let fire come out from Abimelek and burn you up ! And let fire come out from you and burn Abimelek up ! ”
NIRV	Judges	9	21	Then Jotham ran away . He escaped to a town named Beer . He lived there because he was afraid of his brother Abimelek .
NIRV	Judges	9	22	Abimelek ruled over Israel for three years .
NIRV	Judges	9	23	Then God stirred up trouble between Abimelek and the citizens of Shechem . So they turned against Abimelek . They decided not to follow him anymore .
NIRV	Judges	9	24	God made that happen because of what Abimelek had done to Jerub-Baal ’ s
NIRV	Judges	9	25	The citizens of Shechem didn ’ t want Abimelek to be their ruler anymore . So they hid some men on top of the hills . They wanted them to attack and rob everyone who passed by . Abimelek was told about it .
NIRV	Judges	9	26	Gaal and his relatives moved into Shechem . Gaal was the son of Ebed . The citizens of Shechem put their trust in Gaal .
NIRV	Judges	9	27	The people of Shechem went out into the fields . They gathered the grapes . They pressed the juice out of them by stomping on them . Then they held a feast in the temple of their god . While they were eating and drinking , they cursed Abimelek .
NIRV	Judges	9	29	I wish these people were under my command . Then I would get rid of Abimelek . I would say to him , ‘ Call out your whole army ! ’ ”
NIRV	Judges	9	30	Zebul was the governor of Shechem . He heard about what Gaal , the son of Ebed , had said . So he was very angry .
NIRV	Judges	9	31	Zebul secretly sent messengers to Abimelek . They said , “ Gaal , the son of Ebed , has come to Shechem . His relatives have come with him . They are stirring up the city against you .
NIRV	Judges	9	32	So come with your men during the night . Hide in the fields and wait .
NIRV	Judges	9	33	In the morning at sunrise , attack the city . Gaal and his men will come out against you . Then take that opportunity to attack them. ”
NIRV	Judges	9	34	So Abimelek and all his troops started out at night . They went into their hiding places near Shechem . Abimelek had separated them into four fighting groups .
NIRV	Judges	9	35	Gaal , the son of Ebed , had already gone out . He was standing at the entrance of the city gate . He had arrived there just as Abimelek and his troops came out of their hiding places .
NIRV	Judges	9	36	Gaal saw them . He said to Zebul , “ Look ! People are coming down from the tops of the mountains ! ” Zebul replied , “ You are wrong . Those aren ’ t people . They are just the shadows of the mountains. ”
NIRV	Judges	9	37	But Gaal spoke up again . He said , “ Look ! People are coming down from the central hill . Another group is coming from the direction of the fortune tellers ’ tree. ”
NIRV	Judges	9	38	Then Zebul said to Gaal , “ Where is your big talk now ? You said , ‘ Who is Abimelek ? Why should we be under his rule ? ’ Aren ’ t these the people you made fun of ? Go out and fight against them ! ”
NIRV	Judges	9	39	So Gaal led the citizens out of Shechem . They fought against Abimelek .
NIRV	Judges	9	40	He chased Gaal from the field of battle . Abimelek chased them all the way to the entrance of the city gate . Many men were killed as they ran away .
NIRV	Judges	9	41	Abimelek stayed in Arumah . And Zebul drove Gaal and his relatives out of Shechem .
NIRV	Judges	9	42	The next day the people of Shechem went out to work in the fields . Abimelek was told about it .
NIRV	Judges	9	43	So he gathered his men together . He separated them into three fighting groups . Then he hid them in the fields and told them to wait . When he saw the people coming out of the city , he got up to attack them .
NIRV	Judges	9	44	Abimelek and the men with him ran forward . They placed themselves at the entrance of the city gate . Then the other two groups attacked the people in the fields . There they struck them down .
NIRV	Judges	9	45	Abimelek kept up his attack against the city all day long . He didn ’ t stop until he had captured it . Then he killed its people . He destroyed the city . He scattered salt on it to make sure that nothing would be able to grow there .
NIRV	Judges	9	46	The citizens in the tower of Shechem heard about what was happening . So they went to the safest place in the temple of the god named El-Berith .
NIRV	Judges	9	47	Abimelek heard that they had gathered together there .
NIRV	Judges	9	48	He and all his men went up Mount Zalmon . He got an ax and cut off some branches . He carried them on his shoulders . He ordered the men with him to do the same thing . “ Quick ! ” he said . “ Do what you have seen me do ! ”
NIRV	Judges	9	49	So all the men cut branches and followed Abimelek . They piled them against the place where the people had gone for safety . Then they set the place on fire with the people still inside . There were about 1,000 men and women in the tower of Shechem . All of them died .
NIRV	Judges	9	50	Next , Abimelek went to Thebez . He surrounded it . Then he attacked it and captured it .
NIRV	Judges	9	51	But inside the city there was a strong tower . All the people in the city had run to it for safety . All the men and women had gone into it . They had locked themselves in . They had climbed up on the roof of the tower .
NIRV	Judges	9	52	Abimelek went to the tower and attacked it . He approached the entrance to the tower to set it on fire .
NIRV	Judges	9	53	But a woman dropped a large millstone on him . It broke his head open .
NIRV	Judges	9	54	He quickly called out to the man carrying his armor . He said , “ Pull out your sword and kill me . Then people can ’ t say , ‘ A woman killed him. ’ ” So his servant stuck his sword through him . And Abimelek died .
NIRV	Judges	9	55	When the Israelites saw he was dead , they went home .
NIRV	Judges	9	56	That ’ s how God punished Abimelek for the evil thing he had done to his father . He had murdered his
NIRV	Judges	9	57	God also made the people of Shechem pay for all the evil things they had done . The curse of Jotham came down on them . He was the son of Jerub-Baal . Copyright ©

NIRV	Judges	10	10	Then the Israelites cried out to the Lord . They said , “ We have sinned against you . We have deserted our God . We have served gods that are named Baal. ”
NIRV	Judges	10	2	Tola led Israel for
NIRV	Judges	10	23	years . After he died , he was buried in Shamir . Jair
NIRV	Judges	10	3	Jair became the leader after Tola . Jair was from the land of Gilead . He led Israel for
NIRV	Judges	10	22	years .
NIRV	Judges	10	4	He had
NIRV	Judges	10	30	towns in Gilead . Those towns are called Havvoth Jair to this day .
NIRV	Judges	10	5	After Jair died , he was buried in Kamon . Jephthah
NIRV	Judges	10	6	Once again the Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . They served gods that were named Baal . They served female gods that were named Ashtoreth . They worshiped the gods of Aram and Sidon . They served the gods of Moab and Ammon . They also worshiped the gods of the Philistines . The Israelites deserted the Lord . They didn ’ t serve him anymore .
NIRV	Judges	10	7	So the Lord became very angry with them . He handed them over to the Philistines and the Ammonites .
NIRV	Judges	10	8	That year they broke Israel ’ s power completely . They treated the Israelites badly for
NIRV	Judges	10	18	The leaders of Gilead spoke to one another . They said , “ Who will lead the attack against the Ammonites ? That person will be the ruler of all the people who live in Gilead. ” Copyright ©
NIRV	Judges	10	9	The Ammonites also went across the Jordan . They crossed over to fight against the tribes of Judah , Benjamin and Ephraim . Israel was suffering terribly .
NIRV	Judges	10	11	The Lord replied , “ The Egyptians and Amorites treated you badly . So did the Ammonites and Philistines .
NIRV	Judges	10	12	And so did the Amalekites and the people of Sidon and Maon . Each time you cried out to me for help . And I saved you from their power .
NIRV	Judges	10	13	But you have deserted me . You have served other gods . So I will not save you anymore .
NIRV	Judges	10	14	Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen . Let them save you when you get into trouble ! ”
NIRV	Judges	10	15	But the Israelites replied to the Lord , “ We have sinned . Do to us what you think is best . But please save us now. ”
NIRV	Judges	10	16	Then they got rid of the false gods that were among them . They served the Lord . And he couldn ’ t stand to see Israel suffer anymore .
NIRV	Judges	10	17	The Ammonites were called together to fight . They camped in the land of Gilead . Then the Israelites gathered together . They camped at the city of Mizpah .

NIRV	Judges	11	11	So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead . And the people made him their leader and commander . He went to Mizpah . There he repeated to the Lord everything he had said .
NIRV	Judges	11	2	Gilead ’ s wife also had sons by him . When they had grown up , they drove Jephthah away . “ You aren ’ t going to get any share of our family ’ s property , ” they said . “ You are the son of another woman. ”
NIRV	Judges	11	3	So Jephthah ran away from his brothers . He made his home in the land of Tob . A group of men who weren ’ t good for anything gathered around him there . And they followed him .
NIRV	Judges	11	4	Some time later , the Ammonites were fighting against Israel .
NIRV	Judges	11	5	So the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob .
NIRV	Judges	11	6	“ Come with us , ” they said . “ Be our commander . Then we can fight against the Ammonites. ”
NIRV	Judges	11	7	Jephthah said to them , “ Didn ’ t you hate me ? Didn ’ t you drive me away from my father ’ s house ? Why are you coming to me only when you are in trouble ? ”
NIRV	Judges	11	8	The elders of Gilead replied to him . “ You are right , ” they said . “ That ’ s why we ’ re turning to you now . Come with us and fight against the Ammonites . Then you will rule over all of us who live in Gilead. ”
NIRV	Judges	11	9	Jephthah said , “ Suppose you take me back to fight against the Ammonites . And suppose the Lord gives me victory over them . Then will I really be your leader ? ”
NIRV	Judges	11	10	The elders of Gilead replied , “ The Lord is our witness . We ’ ll certainly do as you say. ”
NIRV	Judges	11	12	Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of Ammon . They asked , “ What do you have against me ? Why have you attacked my country ? ”
NIRV	Judges	11	13	The king of Ammon answered Jephthah ’ s messengers . He said , “ Israel came up out of Egypt . At that time they took my land away . They took all the land between the Arnon River and the Jabbok River . It reached all the way to the Jordan River . Now give it back . Then there will be peace. ”
NIRV	Judges	11	14	Jephthah sent messengers back to the king of Ammon .
NIRV	Judges	11	15	They said , “ Here is what Jephthah says to you . Israel didn ’ t take the land of Moab . They didn ’ t take the land of Ammon .
NIRV	Judges	11	16	When Israel came up out of Egypt , they went through the desert to the Red Sea . From there they went on to Kadesh .
NIRV	Judges	11	17	Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom . They said , ‘ Please let us go through your country. ’ But the king of Edom wouldn ’ t listen to them . They sent the same message to the king of Moab . But he refused too . So Israel stayed at Kadesh .
NIRV	Judges	11	18	“ Next , they traveled through the desert . They traveled along the borders of the lands of Edom and Moab . They passed along the east side of the country of Moab . They camped on the other side of the Arnon River . They didn ’ t enter the territory of Moab . The Arnon River was Moab ’ s border .
NIRV	Judges	11	19	“ Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon . He was the king of the Amorites . He ruled in Heshbon . They said to him , ‘ Let us pass through your country to our own land. ’
NIRV	Judges	11	20	towns between Aroer and the area of Minnith . He destroyed them all the way to Abel Keramim . So Israel brought Ammon under their control .
NIRV	Judges	11	21	“ Then the Lord , the God of Israel , handed Sihon and his whole army over to Israel . Israel won the battle over them . Amorites were living in the country at that time . And Israel took over all their land .
NIRV	Judges	11	22	Israel captured all the land between the Arnon River and the Jabbok River . It reached from the desert all the way to the Jordan River .
NIRV	Judges	11	23	“ The Lord , the God of Israel , has driven the Amorites out to make room for his people . So what right do you have to take it over ?
NIRV	Judges	11	24	You will take what your god Chemosh gives you , won ’ t you ? In the same way , we will take over what the Lord our God has given us .
NIRV	Judges	11	25	Are you any better than Balak , the son of Zippor ? Balak was the king of Moab . Did he ever argue with Israel ? Did he ever fight against them ?
NIRV	Judges	11	26	For
NIRV	Judges	11	300	years Israel has been living in Heshbon and Aroer . They have been living in the settlements around those cities . They have also been living in all the towns along the Arnon River . Why didn ’ t you take those places back during that time ?
NIRV	Judges	11	27	I haven ’ t done anything wrong to you . But you are doing something wrong to me . You have gone to war against me . The Lord is the Judge . So let him decide our case today . Let him settle matters between the Israelites and the Ammonites. ”
NIRV	Judges	11	28	But the king of Ammon didn ’ t pay any attention to the message Jephthah sent him .
NIRV	Judges	11	29	Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah . He went across the territories of Gilead and Manasseh . He passed through Mizpah in the land of Gilead . From there he attacked the people of Ammon .
NIRV	Judges	11	30	Jephthah made a promise to the Lord . Jephthah said , “ Hand the Ammonites over to me .
NIRV	Judges	11	31	If you do , here ’ s what I ’ ll do when I come back from winning the battle . Anything that comes out the door of my house to meet me will belong to the Lord . I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering. ”
NIRV	Judges	11	32	Then Jephthah went over to fight against the Ammonites . The Lord handed them over to him .
NIRV	Judges	11	33	Jephthah destroyed
NIRV	Judges	11	34	Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah . And guess who came out to meet him . It was his daughter ! She was dancing to the beat of tambourines . She was his only child . He didn ’ t have any other sons or daughters .
NIRV	Judges	11	35	When Jephthah saw her , he was so upset that he tore his clothes . He cried out , “ Oh no , my daughter ! You have filled me with trouble and sorrow . I ’ ve made a promise to the Lord . And I can ’ t break it. ”
NIRV	Judges	11	36	“ My father , ” she replied , “ you have given your word to the Lord . So do to me just what you promised to do . The Ammonites were your enemies . And the Lord has paid them back for what they did to you .
NIRV	Judges	11	37	But please do one thing for me , ” she continued . “ Give me two months to wander around in the hills . Let me weep there with my friends . I want to do that because I ’ ll never get married. ”
NIRV	Judges	11	38	“ You may go , ” he said . He let her go for two months . She and her friends went into the hills . They were filled with sadness because she would never get married .
NIRV	Judges	11	39	After the two months were over , she returned to her father . He did to her just what he had promised to do . And she was a virgin . So that became a practice in Israel .

NIRV	Judges	12	12	Then he died . He was buried in Aijalon . It was in the land of Zebulun .
NIRV	Judges	12	2	Jephthah answered , “ I and my people were taking part in a great struggle . We were at war with the Ammonites . I asked you for help . But you didn ’ t come to save me from their power .
NIRV	Judges	12	3	I saw that you wouldn ’ t help . So I put my own life in danger . I went across the Jordan to fight against the Ammonites . The Lord helped me win the battle over them . So why have you come up today to fight against me ? ”
NIRV	Judges	12	4	Then Jephthah called the men of Gilead together . They fought against Ephraim . The men of Gilead struck them down . The people of Ephraim had said , “ You people of Gilead are nothing but deserters from Ephraim and Manasseh. ”
NIRV	Judges	12	5	The men of Gilead captured the places where people go across the Jordan River to get to Ephraim . Some men of Ephraim weren ’ t killed in the battle . When they arrived at the river , they would say , “ Let us go across. ” Then the men of Gilead would ask each one , “ Are you from Ephraim ? ” Suppose he replied , “ No. ”
NIRV	Judges	12	6	Then they would say , “ All right . Say ‘ Shibboleth. ’ ” If he said “ Sibboleth , ” the way he said the word would give him away . He couldn ’ t say it correctly . So they would grab him . Then they would kill him at one of the places where people go across the Jordan . At that time , 42,000 men of Ephraim were killed .

NIRV	Judges	13	13	The angel of the Lord answered him . He said , “ Your wife must do everything I have told her to do .
NIRV	Judges	13	40	years .
NIRV	Judges	13	2	A certain man from Zorah was named Manoah . He was from the tribe of Dan . Manoah had a wife who wasn ’ t able to have children .
NIRV	Judges	13	3	The angel of the Lord appeared to Manoah ’ s wife . He said , “ You are not able to have children . But you are going to become pregnant . You will have a baby boy .
NIRV	Judges	13	4	Make sure you do not drink any kind of wine . Also make sure you do not eat anything that is ‘ unclean. ’
NIRV	Judges	13	5	You will become pregnant . You will have a son . The hair on his head must never be cut . That is because the boy will be a Nazirite . He will be set apart to God from the day he is born . He will take the lead in saving Israel from the power of the Philistines. ”
NIRV	Judges	13	6	Then the woman went to her husband . She told him , “ A man of God came to me . He looked like an angel of God . His appearance was so amazing that it filled me with great wonder . I didn ’ t ask him where he came from . And he didn ’ t tell me his name .
NIRV	Judges	13	7	But he said to me , ‘ You will become pregnant . You will have a son . So do not drink any kind of wine . Do not eat anything that is “ unclean. ” That is because the boy will be a Nazirite . He will belong to God in a special way from the day he is born until the day he dies. ’ ”
NIRV	Judges	13	8	Then Manoah prayed to the Lord . He said , “ Pardon your servant , Lord . I beg you to let the man of God you sent to us come again . He told us we would have a son . We want the man of God to teach us how to bring up the boy. ”
NIRV	Judges	13	9	God heard Manoah . And the angel of God came again to the woman . He came while she was out in the field . But her husband Manoah wasn ’ t with her .

NIRV	Judges	13	14	She must not eat anything that comes from grapevines . She must not drink any kind of wine . She must not eat anything that is ‘ unclean. ’ She must do everything I have commanded her to do. ”
NIRV	Judges	13	15	Manoah said to the angel of the Lord , “ We would like you to stay and eat . We want to prepare a young goat for you. ”
NIRV	Judges	13	16	The angel of the Lord replied , “ Even if I stay , I will not eat any of your food . But if you still want to prepare a burnt offering , you must offer it to the Lord. ” Manoah didn ’ t realize it was the angel of the Lord .
NIRV	Judges	13	17	Then Manoah asked the angel of the Lord a question . “ What is your name ? ” he said . “ We want to honor you when your word comes true. ”
NIRV	Judges	13	18	The angel replied , “ Why are you asking me what my name is ? You would not be able to understand it. ”
NIRV	Judges	13	19	Manoah got a young goat . He brought it along with the grain offering . He sacrificed it on a rock to the Lord . Then the Lord did an amazing thing . It happened while Manoah and his wife were watching .
NIRV	Judges	13	20	A flame blazed up from the altar toward heaven . The angel of the Lord rose up in the flame . When Manoah and his wife saw it , they fell with their faces to the ground .
NIRV	Judges	13	21	The angel of the Lord didn ’ t show himself again to Manoah and his wife . Then Manoah realized it was the angel of the Lord .
NIRV	Judges	13	22	“ We ’ re going to die ! ” he said to his wife . “ We ’ ve seen God ! ”
NIRV	Judges	13	23	But his wife answered , “ The Lord doesn ’ t want to kill us . If he did , he wouldn ’ t have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from us . He wouldn ’ t have shown us all these things . He wouldn ’ t have told us we ’ re going to have a son. ”
NIRV	Judges	13	24	Later , the woman had a baby boy . She named him Samson . As he grew up , the Lord blessed him .
NIRV	Judges	13	25	The Spirit of the Lord began to work in his life . It happened while he was in Mahaneh Dan . That place is between Zorah and Eshtaol . Copyright ©

NIRV	Judges	14	14	Samson replied , “ Out of the eater came something to eat . Out of the strong came something sweet. ” For three days they couldn ’ t give him the answer .
NIRV	Judges	14	2	When he returned , he spoke to his father and mother . He said , “ I ’ ve seen a Philistine woman in Timnah . Get her for me . I want her to be my wife. ”
NIRV	Judges	14	3	His father and mother replied , “ Can ’ t we find a wife for you among your relatives ? Isn ’ t there one among any of our people ? Do you have to go to the Philistines to get a wife ? They aren ’ t God ’ s people . They haven ’ t even been circumcised. ” But Samson said to his father , “ Get her for me . She ’ s the right one for me. ”
NIRV	Judges	14	4	Samson ’ s parents didn ’ t know that the Lord wanted things to happen this way . He was working out his plans against the Philistines . That ’ s because the Philistines were ruling over Israel at that time .
NIRV	Judges	14	5	Samson went down to Timnah . His father and mother went with him . They approached the vineyards of Timnah . Suddenly a young lion came roaring toward Samson .
NIRV	Judges	14	6	Then the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully on Samson . So he tore the lion apart with his bare hands . He did it as easily as he might have torn a young goat apart . But he didn ’ t tell his father or mother what he had done .
NIRV	Judges	14	7	Then he went down and talked with the woman . He liked her .
NIRV	Judges	14	8	Some time later , he was going back to marry her . But he turned off the road to look at the lion ’ s dead body . He saw large numbers of bees and some honey in it .
NIRV	Judges	14	9	He dug out the honey with his hands . He ate it as he walked along . Then he joined his parents again . He gave them some honey . They ate it too . But he didn ’ t tell them he had taken it from the lion ’ s dead body .
NIRV	Judges	14	10	Samson ’ s father went down to see the woman . Samson had a feast prepared there . He was following the practice of young men when they married their wives .
NIRV	Judges	14	11	When the people saw Samson , they gave him
NIRV	Judges	14	30	of their men . He took everything they had with them . And he gave their clothes to those who had explained the riddle . Samson was very angry as he returned to his father ’ s home .
NIRV	Judges	14	12	“ Let me tell you a riddle , ” Samson said to the companions . “ The feast will last for seven days . Give me the answer to the riddle before the feast ends . If you do , I ’ ll give you
NIRV	Judges	14	13	But suppose you can ’ t give me the answer . Then you must give me
NIRV	Judges	14	15	On the fourth day they spoke to Samson ’ s wife . “ Get your husband to explain the riddle for us , ” they said . “ If you don ’ t , we ’ ll burn you to death . We ’ ll burn up everyone in your family . Did you invite us here to steal our property ? ”
NIRV	Judges	14	16	Then Samson ’ s wife threw herself on him . She sobbed , “ You hate me ! You don ’ t really love me . You have given my people a riddle . But you haven ’ t told me the answer. ” “ I haven ’ t even explained it to my father or mother , ” he replied . “ So why should I explain it to you ? ”
NIRV	Judges	14	17	She cried during the whole seven days the feast was going on . So on the seventh day he finally told her the answer to the riddle . That ’ s because she kept on asking him to tell her . Then she explained the riddle to her people .
NIRV	Judges	14	18	Before sunset on the seventh day of the feast the men of the town spoke to Samson . They said , “ What is sweeter than honey ? What is stronger than a lion ? ” Samson said to them , “ You have plowed with my young cow . If you hadn ’ t , you wouldn ’ t have known the answer to my riddle. ”
NIRV	Judges	14	19	Then the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully on Samson . He went down to Ashkelon . He struck down

NIRV	Judges	15	15	He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey . He grabbed it and struck down 1,000 men .
NIRV	Judges	15	2	Her father said , “ I was sure you hated her . So I gave her to your companion . Isn ’ t her younger sister more beautiful ? Take her instead. ”
NIRV	Judges	15	3	Samson said to them , “ This time I have a right to get even with the Philistines . I ’ m going to hurt them badly. ”
NIRV	Judges	15	4	So he went out and caught
NIRV	Judges	15	300	foxes . He tied them in pairs by their tails . Then he tied a torch to each pair of tails .
NIRV	Judges	15	5	He lit the torches . He let the foxes loose in the fields of grain that belonged to the Philistines . He burned up the grain that had been cut and stacked . He burned up the grain that was still growing . He also burned up the vineyards and olive trees .
NIRV	Judges	15	6	The Philistines asked , “ Who did this ? ” They were told , “ Samson did . He ’ s the son-in-law of the man from Timnah . Samson did it because his wife was given to his companion. ” So the Philistines went up and burned the woman and her father to death .
NIRV	Judges	15	7	Samson said to the Philistines , “ Is that how you act ? Then I promise I won ’ t stop until I pay you back. ”
NIRV	Judges	15	8	He struck them down with heavy blows . He killed many of them . Then he went down and stayed in a cave . It was in the rock of Etam .
NIRV	Judges	15	9	The Philistines went up and camped in Judah . They spread out near Lehi .
NIRV	Judges	15	10	The people of Judah asked , “ Why have you come to fight against us ? ” “ We ’ ve come to take Samson as our prisoner , ” they answered . “ We want to do to him what he did to us. ”
NIRV	Judges	15	11	Then 3,000 men from Judah went to get Samson . They went down to the cave in the rock of Etam . They said to Samson , “ Don ’ t you realize the Philistines are ruling over us ? What have you done to us ? ” Samson answered , “ I only did to them what they did to me. ”
NIRV	Judges	15	12	The men of Judah said to him , “ We ’ ve come to tie you up . We ’ re going to hand you over to the Philistines. ” Samson said , “ Promise me you won ’ t kill me yourselves. ”
NIRV	Judges	15	13	“ We agree , ” they answered . “ We ’ ll only tie you up and hand you over to them . We won ’ t kill you. ” So they tied him up with two new ropes . They led him up from the rock .
NIRV	Judges	15	14	Samson approached Lehi . The Philistines came toward him shouting . Then the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully on Samson . The ropes on his arms became like burned thread . They dropped off his hands .
NIRV	Judges	15	16	Then Samson said , “ By using a donkey ’ s jawbone I ’ ve made them look like donkeys . By using a donkey ’ s jawbone I ’ ve struck down 1,000 men. ”
NIRV	Judges	15	17	Samson finished speaking . Then he threw the jawbone away . That ’ s why the place was called Ramath Lehi .
NIRV	Judges	15	18	Samson was very thirsty . So he cried out to the Lord . He said , “ You have helped me win this great battle . Do I have to die of thirst now ? Must I fall into the power of people who haven ’ t even been circumcised ? They aren ’ t your people. ”
NIRV	Judges	15	19	Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi . Water came out of it . When Samson drank the water , his strength returned . He felt as good as new . So the spring was called En Hakkore . It ’ s still there in Lehi .

NIRV	Judges	16	16	She continued to pester him day after day . She nagged him until he was sick and tired of it .
NIRV	Judges	16	2	The people of Gaza were told , “ Samson is here ! ” So they surrounded the place . They hid and waited for him at the city gate all night long . They didn ’ t make any move against him during the night . They said , “ Let ’ s wait until the sun comes up . Then we ’ ll kill him. ”
NIRV	Judges	16	3	But Samson stayed there only until the middle of the night . Then he got up . He took hold of the doors of the city gate . He also took hold of the two doorposts . He tore them loose , together with their metal bar . He picked them up and put them on his shoulders . Then he carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron .
NIRV	Judges	16	4	Some time later , Samson fell in love again . The woman lived in the Valley of Sorek . Her name was Delilah .
NIRV	Judges	16	5	The rulers of the Philistines went to her . They said , “ See if you can get him to tell you the secret of why he ’ s so strong . Find out how we can overpower him . Then we can tie him up . We can bring him under our control . Each of us will give you
NIRV	Judges	16	28	Then he prayed to the Lord . Samson said , “ Lord and King , show me that you still have concern for me . Please , God , make me strong just one more time . Let me pay the Philistines back for what they did to my two eyes . Let me do it with only one blow. ”
NIRV	Judges	16	6	So Delilah said to Samson , “ Tell me the secret of why you are so strong . Tell me how you can be tied up and controlled. ”
NIRV	Judges	16	7	Samson answered her , “ Let someone tie me up with seven new bowstrings . They must be strings that aren ’ t completely dry . Then I ’ ll become as weak as any other man. ”
NIRV	Judges	16	8	So the Philistine rulers brought seven new bowstrings to her . They weren ’ t completely dry . Delilah tied Samson up with them .
NIRV	Judges	16	9	Men were hiding in the room . She called out to him , “ Samson ! The Philistines are attacking you ! ” But he snapped the bowstrings easily . They were like pieces of string that had come too close to a flame . So the secret of why he was so strong wasn ’ t discovered .
NIRV	Judges	16	10	Delilah spoke to Samson again . “ You have made me look foolish , ” she said . “ You told me a lie . Come on . Tell me how you can be tied up. ”
NIRV	Judges	16	11	Samson said , “ Let someone tie me tightly with new ropes . They must be ropes that have never been used . Then I ’ ll become as weak as any other man. ”
NIRV	Judges	16	12	So Delilah got some new ropes . She tied him up with them . Men were hiding in the room . She called out to him , “ Samson ! The Philistines are attacking you ! ” But he snapped the ropes off his arms . They fell off just as if they were threads .
NIRV	Judges	16	13	Delilah spoke to Samson again . “ All this time you have been making me look foolish , ” she said . “ You have been telling me lies . This time really tell me how you can be tied up. ” He replied , “ Weave the seven braids of my hair into the cloth on a loom . Then tighten the cloth with a pin . If you do , I ’ ll become as weak as any other man. ” So while Samson was sleeping , Delilah took hold of the seven braids of his hair . She wove them into the cloth on a loom .
NIRV	Judges	16	14	Then she tightened the cloth with a pin . Again she called out to him , “ Samson ! The Philistines are attacking you ! ” He woke up from his sleep . He pulled up the pin and the loom , together with the cloth .
NIRV	Judges	16	15	Then she said to him , “ How can you say , ‘ I love you ’ ? You won ’ t even share your secret with me . This is the third time you have made me look foolish . And you still haven ’ t told me the secret of why you are so strong. ”
NIRV	Judges	16	17	So he told her everything . He said , “ My hair has never been cut . That ’ s because I ’ ve been a Nazirite since the day I was born . A Nazirite is set apart to God . If you shave my head , I won ’ t be strong anymore . I ’ ll become as weak as any other man. ”
NIRV	Judges	16	18	Delilah realized he had told her everything . So she sent a message to the Philistine rulers . She said , “ Come back one more time . He has told me everything. ” So the rulers returned . They brought the silver with them .
NIRV	Judges	16	19	Delilah got Samson to go to sleep on her lap . Then she called for someone to shave off the seven braids of his hair . That ’ s how she began to bring Samson under her control . And he wasn ’ t strong anymore .
NIRV	Judges	16	20	years . Copyright ©
NIRV	Judges	16	21	Then the Philistines grabbed him . They poked his eyes out . They took him down to Gaza . They put bronze chains around him . Then they made him grind grain in the prison .
NIRV	Judges	16	22	His head had been shaved . But the hair on it began to grow again . Samson Dies
NIRV	Judges	16	23	The rulers of the Philistines gathered together . They were going to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon . They were going to celebrate . They said , “ Our god has handed our enemy Samson over to us. ”
NIRV	Judges	16	24	When the people saw Samson , they praised their god . They said , “ Our god has handed our enemy over to us . Our enemy has destroyed our land . He has killed large numbers of our people. ”
NIRV	Judges	16	25	After they had drunk a lot of wine , they shouted , “ Bring Samson out . Let him put on a show for us. ” So they called Samson out of the prison . He put on a show for them . They had him stand near the temple pillars .
NIRV	Judges	16	26	Then he spoke to the servant who was holding his hand . He said , “ Put me where I can feel the pillars . I ’ m talking about the ones that hold up the temple . I want to lean against them. ”
NIRV	Judges	16	27	The temple was crowded with men and women . All the Philistine rulers were there . About 3,000 men and women were on the roof . They were watching Samson put on a show .
NIRV	Judges	16	29	Then Samson reached toward the two pillars that were in the middle of the temple . They were the ones that held up the temple . He put his right hand on one of them . He put his left hand on the other . He leaned hard against them .
NIRV	Judges	16	30	Samson said , “ Let me die together with the Philistines ! ” Then he pushed with all his might . The temple came down on the rulers . It fell on all the people in it . So Samson killed many more Philistines when he died than he did while he lived .
NIRV	Judges	16	31	Then his brothers went down to get him . So did his father ’ s whole family . All of them brought Samson back home . They buried him in the tomb of his father Manoah . It ’ s between Zorah and Eshtaol . Samson had led Israel for

NIRV	Judges	17	17	A man named Micah lived in the hill country of Ephraim .
NIRV	Judges	17	2	He said to his mother , “ Someone took
NIRV	Judges	17	28	pounds of silver back to his mother . She said to him , “ I ’ m making a promise to set apart my silver to the Lord . My son , I want you to use it to cover a statue of a god made out of wood or stone . That ’ s why I ’ ll give the silver back to you. ”
NIRV	Judges	17	3	He gave the
NIRV	Judges	17	4	Micah gave the silver back to his mother . Then she gave five pounds of it to a skilled worker who made things out of silver . He used the silver for the statue . The statue was put in Micah ’ s house .
NIRV	Judges	17	5	That same Micah had a small temple . He made a sacred linen apron and some statues of his family gods . He appointed one of his sons to serve as his priest .
NIRV	Judges	17	6	In those days Israel didn ’ t have a king . The people did anything they thought was right .
NIRV	Judges	17	7	A young Levite had been living in land that belonged to the tribe of Judah . He was from Bethlehem in Judah .
NIRV	Judges	17	8	He left that town to look for some other place to stay . On his way he came to Micah ’ s house . It was in the hill country of Ephraim .
NIRV	Judges	17	9	Micah asked him , “ Where are you from ? ” “ I ’ m a Levite , ” he said . “ I ’ m from Bethlehem in Judah . I ’ m looking for a place to stay. ”
NIRV	Judges	17	10	Then Micah said to him , “ Live with me . Be my father and priest . I ’ ll give you four ounces of silver a year . I ’ ll also give you clothes and food. ”
NIRV	Judges	17	11	So the Levite agreed to live with him . The young man became just like one of Micah ’ s sons to him .
NIRV	Judges	17	12	Then Micah appointed the Levite to serve as his priest . He lived in Micah ’ s house .
NIRV	Judges	17	13	Micah said , “ Now I know that the Lord will be good to me . This Levite has become my priest. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Judges	18	18	When the five men went into Micah ’ s house and took all those things , the priest spoke to them . He asked , “ What are you doing ? ”
NIRV	Judges	18	2	So the people of Dan sent out five of their leading men from Zorah and Eshtaol . They told the men to look over the land and check it out . Those men did it for all the people of Dan . Those people told the men , “ Go . Check out the land. ” So they entered the hill country of Ephraim . They went to the house of Micah . That ’ s where they spent the night .
NIRV	Judges	18	3	When they came near Micah ’ s house , they recognized a voice . It was the voice of the young Levite . So they turned off the road and stopped there . They asked him , “ Who brought you here ? What are you doing in this place ? Why are you here ? ”
NIRV	Judges	18	4	The Levite told them what Micah had done for him . He said , “ He has hired me . I ’ m his priest. ”
NIRV	Judges	18	5	Then they said to him , “ Please ask God for advice . Try to find out whether we ’ ll have success on our journey. ”
NIRV	Judges	18	6	The priest answered them , “ Go in peace . The Lord is pleased with your journey. ”
NIRV	Judges	18	7	So the five men left . They came to Laish . There they saw that the people felt secure . They were living in safety . Like the people in Sidon , they were at peace . Their land had everything they needed . Things were going very well for them . They lived a long way from the people of Sidon . And they didn ’ t think they would ever need help from anyone else .
NIRV	Judges	18	8	The men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol . Their people asked them , “ What did you find out ? ”
NIRV	Judges	18	9	They answered , “ Come on ! Let ’ s attack them ! We ’ ve seen the land , and it is very good . Aren ’ t you going to do something ? Don ’ t wait any longer . Go there and take it over .
NIRV	Judges	18	10	When you get there , you will find people who aren ’ t expecting anything bad to happen to them . Their land has plenty of room . God has handed it over to you . It ’ s a land that has everything you will ever need. ”
NIRV	Judges	18	11	So
NIRV	Judges	18	600	men stood there with him . They were prepared for battle .
NIRV	Judges	18	12	On their way they set up camp . Their camp was near Kiriath Jearim in Judah . That ’ s why the place is called Mahaneh Dan to this day . It ’ s west of Kiriath Jearim .
NIRV	Judges	18	13	From there they went to the hill country of Ephraim . They came to Micah ’ s house .
NIRV	Judges	18	14	Then the five men who had looked over the land of Laish spoke to the other members of their tribe . They said , “ Don ’ t you know that one of these houses has a sacred linen apron in it ? Some statues of family gods are there . That house also has another statue of a god covered with silver . Now you know what to do. ”
NIRV	Judges	18	15	So they turned off the road and stopped there . They went to the house of the young Levite . He was at Micah ’ s place . They greeted the young man .
NIRV	Judges	18	16	The
NIRV	Judges	18	17	The five men who had looked over the land went inside . They took the statue covered with silver . They also took the family gods and the linen apron . During that time , the priest stood at the entrance of the gate . The
NIRV	Judges	18	19	They answered him , “ Be quiet ! Don ’ t say a word . Come with us . Be our father and priest . You can serve a whole tribe and family group in Israel as our priest . Isn ’ t that better than serving just one man ’ s family ? ”
NIRV	Judges	18	20	The priest was very pleased . He took the linen apron and the family gods . He also took the statue of the god that was covered with silver . Then the priest left with the people .
NIRV	Judges	18	21	They put their little children and their livestock in front of them . They also put everything else they owned in front of them . And they turned and went on their way .
NIRV	Judges	18	22	The men who lived near Micah were called together . Then they left and caught up with the people of Dan . That ’ s because Dan ’ s people hadn ’ t gone very far from Micah ’ s house .
NIRV	Judges	18	23	Those who lived near Micah shouted at them . The people of Dan turned around and asked Micah , “ What ’ s the matter with you ? Why did you call out your men to fight against us ? ”
NIRV	Judges	18	24	He replied , “ You took away the gods I made . And you took away my priest . What do I have left ? So how can you ask , ‘ What ’ s the matter with you ? ’ ”
NIRV	Judges	18	25	The people of Dan answered , “ Don ’ t argue with us . Some of the men may get angry and attack you . Then you and your family will lose your lives. ”
NIRV	Judges	18	26	So the people of Dan went on their way . Micah saw that they were too strong for him . So he turned around and went back home .
NIRV	Judges	18	27	The people of Dan took what Micah had made . They also took his priest . They continued on their way to Laish . They went there to fight against a people who were at peace and secure . The people of Dan struck them down with their swords . They burned down their city .
NIRV	Judges	18	28	No one could save those people and their city . They lived a long way from Sidon . And they didn ’ t think they would ever need help from anyone else . Their city was located in a valley near Beth Rehob . The people of Dan rebuilt the city . Then they made their homes there .
NIRV	Judges	18	29	They named it Dan . That ’ s because they traced their family line back to Dan . He was a son of Israel . The city used to be called Laish .
NIRV	Judges	18	30	There the people of Dan set up for themselves the statue of the god that was covered with silver . Jonathan and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan . Jonathan was the son of Gershom , the son of Moses . Jonathan and his sons were priests until the time when the land was captured .
NIRV	Judges	18	31	The people of Dan continued to use the statue Micah had made . They used it during the whole time the house of God was in Shiloh . Copyright ©

NIRV	Judges	19	19	We have straw and feed for our donkeys . We have food and wine for ourselves . We have enough for me , the woman and the young man with us . We don ’ t need anything. ”
NIRV	Judges	19	2	But she wasn ’ t faithful to him . She left him . She went back to her parents ’ home in Bethlehem in Judah . She stayed there for four months .
NIRV	Judges	19	3	Then her husband went to see her . He tried to talk her into coming back with him . He had his servant and two donkeys with him . She took her husband into her parents ’ home . When her father saw him , he gladly welcomed him .
NIRV	Judges	19	4	His father-in-law , the woman ’ s father , begged him to stay . So the Levite remained with him for three days . He ate , drank and slept there .
NIRV	Judges	19	5	On the fourth day they got up early . The Levite prepared to leave . But the woman ’ s father said to his son-in-law , “ Have something to eat . It will give you strength . Then you can go on your way. ”
NIRV	Judges	19	6	So the two of them sat down . They ate and drank together . After that , the woman ’ s father said , “ Please stay tonight . Enjoy yourself. ”
NIRV	Judges	19	7	The man got up to go . But his father-in-law talked him into staying . So he stayed there that night .
NIRV	Judges	19	8	On the morning of the fifth day , the Levite got up to go . But the woman ’ s father said , “ Have something to eat . It will give you strength . Wait until this afternoon ! ” So the two of them ate together .
NIRV	Judges	19	9	Then the man got up to leave . His concubine and his servant got up when he did . But his father-in-law , the woman ’ s father , spoke to him again . “ Look , ” he said . “ It ’ s almost evening . The day is nearly over . So spend another night here . Please stay . Enjoy yourself . Early tomorrow morning you can get up and go back home. ”
NIRV	Judges	19	10	But the man didn ’ t want to stay another night . So he left . He went toward Jebus . Jebus is also called Jerusalem . The Levite had his two donkeys and his concubine with him . The donkeys had saddles on them .
NIRV	Judges	19	11	By the time the travelers came near Jebus , the day was almost over . So the servant said to his master , “ Come . Let ’ s stop at this Jebusite city . Let ’ s spend the night here. ”
NIRV	Judges	19	12	pieces . He sent them into all the territories of Israel .
NIRV	Judges	19	13	He added , “ Come . Let ’ s try to reach Gibeah or Ramah . We can spend the night in one of those places. ”
NIRV	Judges	19	14	So they continued on . As they came near Gibeah in Benjamin , the sun went down .
NIRV	Judges	19	15	They stopped there to spend the night . They went to the city ’ s main street and sat down . But no one took them home for the night .
NIRV	Judges	19	16	That evening an old man came into the city . He had been working in the fields . He was from the hill country of Ephraim . But he was living in Gibeah . The people who lived there were from the tribe of Benjamin .
NIRV	Judges	19	17	The old man saw the traveler in the main street . He asked , “ Where are you going ? Where did you come from ? ”
NIRV	Judges	19	18	The Levite answered , “ We ’ ve come from Bethlehem in Judah . We ’ re on our way to Ephraim . I live deep in the hill country there . I ’ ve been to Bethlehem . Now I ’ m going to the house of the Lord . But no one has taken me home for the night .
NIRV	Judges	19	20	“ You are welcome at my house , ” the old man said . “ I ’ d be happy to supply anything you might need . But don ’ t spend the night in the street. ”
NIRV	Judges	19	21	So the old man took him into his house and fed his donkeys . After the travelers had washed their feet , they had something to eat and drink .
NIRV	Judges	19	22	They were inside enjoying themselves . But some of the evil men who lived in the city surrounded the house . They pounded on the door . They shouted to the old man who owned the house . They said , “ Bring out the man who came to your house . We want to have sex with him. ”
NIRV	Judges	19	23	The owner of the house went outside . He said to them , “ No , my friends . Don ’ t do such an evil thing . This man is my guest . So don ’ t do this terrible thing .
NIRV	Judges	19	24	Look , here is my virgin daughter . And here ’ s the Levite ’ s concubine . I ’ ll bring them out to you now . You can have them . Do to them what you want to . But don ’ t do such a terrible thing to this man. ”
NIRV	Judges	19	25	The men wouldn ’ t listen to him . So the Levite sent his concubine out to them . They forced her to have sex with them . They raped her all night long . As the night was ending , they let her go .
NIRV	Judges	19	26	At sunrise she went back to the house where her master was staying . She fell down at the door . She stayed there until daylight .
NIRV	Judges	19	27	Later that morning her master got up . He opened the door of the house . He stepped out to continue on his way . But his concubine was lying there . She had fallen at the doorway of the house . Her hands were reaching out toward the door .
NIRV	Judges	19	28	He said to her , “ Get up . Let ’ s go. ” But there wasn ’ t any answer . Then he put her dead body on his donkey . And he started out for home .
NIRV	Judges	19	29	When he reached home , he got a knife . He cut up his concubine . He cut her into
NIRV	Judges	19	30	Everyone who saw it spoke to one another . They said , “ Nothing like this has ever been seen or done before . Nothing like this has happened since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt . Just imagine ! We must do something ! So let ’ s hear your ideas ! ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Judges	20	20	The Israelites went out to fight against the men of Benjamin . They took up their battle positions against them at Gibeah .
NIRV	Judges	20	2	The leaders of all the tribes of Israel came . They took their places among the people of God gathered together . There were 400,000 men carrying swords .
NIRV	Judges	20	3	The tribe of Benjamin heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah . The Israelites said , “ Tell us how this awful thing happened. ”
NIRV	Judges	20	4	So the Levite spoke . He was the husband of the woman who had been murdered . He said , “ I and my concubine went to Gibeah in Benjamin . We spent the night there .
NIRV	Judges	20	5	During the night the men of Gibeah came after me . They surrounded the house . They were planning to kill me . They raped my concubine , and she died .
NIRV	Judges	20	6	I took my concubine and cut her into pieces . I sent one piece to each part of Israel ’ s territory . I did it because the men of Gibeah had done a very terrible thing in Israel .
NIRV	Judges	20	7	All you men of Israel , speak up now . Tell me what you have decided to do. ”
NIRV	Judges	20	8	All the men got up together . They said , “ None of us will go home . Not one of us will return to his house .
NIRV	Judges	20	9	Here is what we ’ ll do to Gibeah . We ’ ll cast lots to tell us how to attack the city .
NIRV	Judges	20	10	We ’ ll take ten men out of every
NIRV	Judges	20	100	from every 1,000 . We ’ ll take 1,000 from every 10,000 . The men we take will get supplies for the army . Then the army will go to Gibeah in Benjamin . They ’ ll give Gibeah exactly what they should get because of the terrible thing they did in Israel. ”
NIRV	Judges	20	11	So all the men of Israel came together to fight against the city .
NIRV	Judges	20	12	The tribes of Israel sent people to carry a message through the whole tribe of Benjamin . They said , “ What about this awful crime that was committed among you ?
NIRV	Judges	20	13	Hand over to us those evil men of Gibeah . We ’ ll put them to death . In that way we ’ ll get rid of those evil people. ” But the people of Benjamin wouldn ’ t listen to the other Israelites .
NIRV	Judges	20	14	They came together at Gibeah from their towns . They came to fight against the other Israelites .
NIRV	Judges	20	15	Right away the people of Benjamin gathered together 26,000 men from their towns . They were carrying swords . These men were added to the
NIRV	Judges	20	700	who were left-handed . Each of them could sling a stone at a hair and not miss .
NIRV	Judges	20	16	Among all these men there were
NIRV	Judges	20	17	Israel gathered 400,000 men together . They were carrying swords . All of them were trained for battle . That number didn ’ t include the tribe of Benjamin .
NIRV	Judges	20	18	The Israelites went up to Bethel . There they asked God , “ Who should go up first and fight against the people of Benjamin ? ” The Lord answered , “ The tribe of Judah will go first. ”
NIRV	Judges	20	19	The next morning the Israelites got up . They set up camp near Gibeah .
NIRV	Judges	20	21	The men of Benjamin came out of Gibeah . They killed 22,000 Israelites on the field of battle that day .
NIRV	Judges	20	22	But the Israelites cheered one another on . They again took up their positions in the places where they had been the first day .
NIRV	Judges	20	23	The Israelites went and wept in front of the Lord until evening . They asked the Lord , “ Should we go up again to fight against the men of Benjamin ? They are our fellow Israelites. ” The Lord answered , “ Go up and fight against them. ”
NIRV	Judges	20	24	The Israelites came near the men of Benjamin on the second day .
NIRV	Judges	20	25	The men of Benjamin came out from Gibeah to oppose them . That time they killed 18,000 more Israelites . All the men who died had been carrying swords .
NIRV	Judges	20	26	Then all the Israelites , the whole army , went up to Bethel . They sat there and wept in front of the Lord . They didn ’ t eat anything that day until evening . Then they brought burnt offerings and friendship offerings to the Lord .
NIRV	Judges	20	27	Again the Israelites spoke to the Lord . In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there .
NIRV	Judges	20	28	Phinehas was serving as priest at the ark . He was the son of Eleazar . Eleazar was the son of Aaron . The Israelites asked , “ Should we go up again to fight against the men of Benjamin ? They are our fellow Israelites. ” The Lord answered , “ Go . Tomorrow I will hand them over to you. ”
NIRV	Judges	20	29	Then Israel hid some men and had them wait all around Gibeah .
NIRV	Judges	20	30	of them . They had said , “ We ’ re winning the battle over them , just as we did the first time. ”
NIRV	Judges	20	31	The men of Benjamin came out to fight against them . They were drawn away from the city . They began to wound and kill the Israelites just as they had done before . About
NIRV	Judges	20	32	The men of Benjamin said , “ We ’ re winning the battle over them , just as we did before. ” But the men of Israel said , “ Let ’ s pull back . Let ’ s draw them away from the city to the roads. ”
NIRV	Judges	20	33	All the men of Israel moved away from their places . They took up new battle positions at Baal Tamar . The men who had been hiding charged out . They came from west of Gibeah .
NIRV	Judges	20	34	Then 10,000 of Israel ’ s capable young men attacked Gibeah . The men of Benjamin didn ’ t realize they were about to be destroyed . The fighting was very heavy .
NIRV	Judges	20	35	The Lord helped Israel win the battle over Benjamin . On that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 men of Benjamin . All the men who died had been carrying swords .
NIRV	Judges	20	36	Then the men of Benjamin saw that they had lost the battle . The men of Israel had moved away from their positions in front of Benjamin . They had depended on the men they had hidden near Gibeah .
NIRV	Judges	20	37	Suddenly those men who had been hiding rushed into Gibeah . They spread out . Then they killed everyone in the city with their swords .
NIRV	Judges	20	38	The Israelites had made a plan with those who had been hiding . They had told them to send up a large cloud of smoke from the city .
NIRV	Judges	20	39	Then the Israelites would turn around and attack . The men of Benjamin had begun to wound and kill the men of Israel . They had struck down about
NIRV	Judges	20	40	But a large cloud of smoke began to go up from the city . The men of Benjamin turned around . They saw the the whole city going up in smoke .
NIRV	Judges	20	41	Then the Israelites turned around and attacked them . The men of Benjamin were terrified . They realized they were going to be destroyed .
NIRV	Judges	20	42	So they ran away from the men of Israel . They ran toward the desert . But they couldn ’ t escape the battle . Other Israelites came out of the towns . There they struck down the men of Benjamin .
NIRV	Judges	20	43	Here ’ s how it happened . The Israelites had surrounded them . They had chased them and easily caught up with them east of Gibeah .
NIRV	Judges	20	44	So 18,000 men of Benjamin fell in battle . All of them were brave fighters .
NIRV	Judges	20	45	Some men of Benjamin turned back . They ran toward the desert to the rock of Rimmon . As they did , the Israelites struck down 5,000 of them along the roads . They kept chasing the men of Benjamin all the way to Gidom . Along the way they struck down 2,000 more .
NIRV	Judges	20	46	On that day 25,000 men of Benjamin fell in battle . They had been carrying swords . All of them were brave fighters .
NIRV	Judges	20	47	But
NIRV	Judges	20	600	of them turned back . They ran into the desert to the rock of Rimmon . They stayed there for four months .
NIRV	Judges	20	48	The men of Israel went back to Benjamin . In all the towns they killed the people with their swords . They even killed the animals . So they killed everything they found . They set on fire all the towns they came to . Copyright ©

NIRV	Judges	21	21	and watch . The young women of Shiloh will come out . They ’ ll join in the dancing . When they do , run out of the vineyards . Each of you grab a young woman from Shiloh to be your wife . Then return to the land of Benjamin .
NIRV	Judges	21	2	The people went to Bethel . They sat there until evening in front of God . They wept loudly and bitterly .
NIRV	Judges	21	3	“ Lord , you are the God of Israel , ” they cried . “ Why has this happened to Israel ? Why is one tribe missing from Israel today ? ”
NIRV	Judges	21	4	Early the next day the people built an altar . They brought burnt offerings and friendship offerings .
NIRV	Judges	21	5	Then the Israelites asked , “ Has anyone failed to come here in front of the Lord ? Is anyone missing from all the tribes of Israel ? ” The people had made a promise . They had said that anyone who failed to come to Mizpah in front of the Lord must be put to death .
NIRV	Judges	21	6	The Israelites were very sad because of what had happened to the tribe of Benjamin . After all , they were their fellow Israelites . “ Today one tribe has been cut off from Israel , ” they said .
NIRV	Judges	21	7	“ How can we provide wives for the men who are left ? We ’ ve made a promise in front of the Lord . We ’ ve promised not to give any of our daughters to be married to them. ”
NIRV	Judges	21	8	Then they asked , “ Has any tribe of Israel failed to come here to Mizpah in front of the Lord ? ” They discovered that no one from Jabesh Gilead had come . No one from there had gathered together with the others in the camp .
NIRV	Judges	21	9	They counted the people . They found that none of the people of Jabesh Gilead had come to Mizpah .
NIRV	Judges	21	10	So the community sent 12,000 fighting men to Jabesh Gilead . They directed them to take their swords and kill those living there . That included the women and children .
NIRV	Judges	21	11	“ Here is what you must do , ” they said . “ Kill every male . Also kill every woman who is not a virgin. ”
NIRV	Judges	21	12	They found
NIRV	Judges	21	400	young women in Jabesh Gilead who had never slept with a man . So they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan .
NIRV	Judges	21	13	Then the whole community sent an offer of peace to the men of Benjamin . The men were at the rock of Rimmon .
NIRV	Judges	21	14	So the men of Benjamin returned at that time . They were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared . But there weren ’ t enough women for all of them .
NIRV	Judges	21	15	The people were very sad because of what had happened to the tribe of Benjamin . The Lord had left a gap in the tribes of Israel . They weren ’ t complete without Benjamin .
NIRV	Judges	21	16	The elders of the community spoke up . They said , “ All the women of Benjamin have been wiped out . So how will we find wives for the men who are left ?
NIRV	Judges	21	17	The men of Benjamin who are still alive need to have children , ” they said . “ If they don ’ t , a tribe of Israel will be wiped out .
NIRV	Judges	21	18	But we can ’ t give them our daughters to be their wives . We Israelites have made a promise . We ’ ve said , ‘ May anyone who gives a wife to a man from Benjamin be under the Lord ’ s curse. ’
NIRV	Judges	21	19	Look , a feast is celebrated every year in Shiloh to honor the Lord . Shiloh is north of Bethel . It ’ s east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem . It ’ s south of Lebonah. ”
NIRV	Judges	21	20	So they told the men of Benjamin what to do . They said , “ Go . Hide in the vineyards
NIRV	Judges	21	22	Their fathers or brothers might not be happy with what we ’ re doing . If they aren ’ t , we ’ ll say to them , ‘ Do us a favor . Help the men of Benjamin . We didn ’ t get wives for them during the battle . You aren ’ t guilty of doing anything wrong . After all , you didn ’ t give your daughters to them . Your daughters were stolen from you. ’ ”
NIRV	Judges	21	23	So that ’ s what the men of Benjamin did . While the young women were dancing , each man caught one . He carried her away to be his wife . Then the men returned to their own share of land . They built the towns again . They made their homes in them .
NIRV	Judges	21	24	At that time the Israelites also left . They went home to their tribes and family groups . Each one went to his own share of land .
NIRV	Judges	21	25	In those days Israel didn ’ t have a king . The people did anything they thought was right . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ruth	1	1	There was a time when Israel didn ’ t have kings to rule over them . But they had leaders to help them . This is a story about some things that happened during that time . There wasn ’ t enough food in the land of Judah . So a man went to live for a while in the country of Moab . He was from Bethlehem in Judah . His wife and two sons went with him .
NIRV	Ruth	1	2	The man ’ s name was Elimelek . His wife ’ s name was Naomi . The names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion . They were from the tribe of Ephraim . Their home had been in Bethlehem in Judah . They went to Moab and lived there .
NIRV	Ruth	1	3	Naomi ’ s husband Elimelek died . So she was left with her two sons .
NIRV	Ruth	1	4	They married women from Moab . One was named Orpah . The other was named Ruth . Naomi ’ s family lived in Moab for about ten years .
NIRV	Ruth	1	5	Then Mahlon and Kilion also died . So Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband . Naomi and Ruth Return to Bethlehem
NIRV	Ruth	1	6	While Naomi was in Moab , she heard that the Lord had helped his people . He had begun to provide food for them again . So Naomi and her two daughters-in-law prepared to go from Moab back to her home .
NIRV	Ruth	1	7	She left the place where she had been living . Her daughters-in-law went with her . They started out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah .
NIRV	Ruth	1	8	Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law , “ Both of you go back . Each of you go to your own mother ’ s home . You were kind to your husbands , who have died . You have also been kind to me . So may the Lord be just as kind to you .
NIRV	Ruth	1	9	May the Lord help each of you find rest in the home of another husband. ” Then she kissed them goodbye . They broke down and wept loudly .
NIRV	Ruth	1	10	They said to her , “ We ’ ll go back to your people with you. ”
NIRV	Ruth	1	11	But Naomi said , “ Go home , my daughters . Why would you want to come with me ? Am I going to have any more sons who could become your husbands ?
NIRV	Ruth	1	12	Go home , my daughters . I ’ m too old to have another husband . Suppose I thought there was still some hope for me . Suppose I married a man tonight . And later I had sons by him .
NIRV	Ruth	1	13	Would you wait until they grew up ? Would you stay single until you could marry them ? No , my daughters . My life is more bitter than yours . The Lord ’ s power has turned against me ! ”
NIRV	Ruth	1	14	When they heard that , they broke down and wept again . Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye . But Ruth held on to her .
NIRV	Ruth	1	15	“ Look , ” said Naomi . “ Your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods . Go back with her. ”
NIRV	Ruth	1	16	But Ruth replied , “ Don ’ t try to make me leave you and go back . Where you go I ’ ll go . Where you stay I ’ ll stay . Your people will be my people . Your God will be my God .
NIRV	Ruth	1	17	Where you die I ’ ll die . And there my body will be buried . I won ’ t let even death separate you from me . If I do , may the Lord punish me greatly. ”
NIRV	Ruth	1	18	Naomi realized that Ruth had made up her mind to go with her . So she stopped trying to make her go back .
NIRV	Ruth	1	19	The two women continued on their way . At last they arrived in Bethlehem . The whole town was stirred up because of them . The women in the town asked , “ Can this possibly be Naomi ? ”
NIRV	Ruth	1	20	“ Don ’ t call me Naomi , ” she told them . “ Call me Mara . The Mighty One has made my life very bitter .
NIRV	Ruth	1	21	I was full when I went away . But the Lord has brought me back empty . So why are you calling me Naomi ? The Lord has made me suffer . The Mighty One has brought trouble on me. ”
NIRV	Ruth	1	22	So Naomi returned from Moab . Ruth , her daughter-in-law from Moab , came with her . They arrived in Bethlehem just when people were beginning to harvest the barley . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ruth	2	2	Ruth , who was from Moab , spoke to Naomi . Ruth said , “ Let me go out to the fields . I ’ ll pick up the grain that has been left . I ’ ll do it behind anyone who is pleased with me. ” Naomi said to her , “ My daughter , go ahead. ”
NIRV	Ruth	2	3	So Ruth went out to a field and began to pick up grain . She worked behind those cutting and gathering the grain . As it turned out , she was working in a field that belonged to Boaz . He was from the family of Elimelek .
NIRV	Ruth	2	4	Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem . He greeted those cutting and gathering the grain . He said , “ May the Lord be with you ! ” “ And may the Lord bless you ! ” they replied .
NIRV	Ruth	2	5	Boaz spoke to the man in charge of his workers . He asked , “ Who does that young woman belong to ? ”
NIRV	Ruth	2	6	The man replied , “ She ’ s from Moab . She came back from there with Naomi .
NIRV	Ruth	2	7	The young woman said , ‘ Please let me walk behind the workers . Let me pick up the grain that is left. ’ She came into the field . She has kept on working here from morning until now . She took only one short rest in the shade. ”
NIRV	Ruth	2	8	So Boaz said to Ruth , “ Dear woman , listen to me . Don ’ t pick up grain in any other field . Don ’ t go anywhere else . Stay here with the women who work for me .
NIRV	Ruth	2	9	Keep your eye on the field where the men are cutting grain . Walk behind the women who are gathering it . Pick up the grain that is left . I ’ ve told the men not to bother you . When you are thirsty , go and get a drink . Take water from the jars the men have filled. ”
NIRV	Ruth	2	10	When Ruth heard that , she bowed down with her face to the ground . She asked him , “ Why are you being so kind to me ? In fact , why are you even noticing me ? I ’ m from another country. ”
NIRV	Ruth	2	11	Boaz replied , “ I ’ ve been told all about you . I ’ ve heard about everything you have done for your mother-in-law since your husband died . I know that you left your father and mother . I know that you left your country . You came to live with people you didn ’ t know before .
NIRV	Ruth	2	12	May the Lord reward you for what you have done . May the Lord , the God of Israel , bless you richly . You have come to him to find safety under his care. ”
NIRV	Ruth	2	13	“ Sir , I hope you will continue to be kind to me , ” Ruth said . “ You have made me feel safe . You have spoken kindly to me . And I ’ m not even as important as one of your servants ! ”
NIRV	Ruth	2	14	When it was time to eat , Boaz spoke to Ruth again . “ Come over here , ” he said . “ Have some bread . Dip it in the wine vinegar. ” She sat down with the workers . Then Boaz offered her some grain that had been cooked . She ate all she wanted . She even had some left over .
NIRV	Ruth	2	15	Ruth got up to pick up more grain . Then Boaz gave orders to his men . He said , “ Let her take some stalks from what the women have tied up . Don ’ t tell her she can ’ t .
NIRV	Ruth	2	16	Even pull out some stalks for her . Leave them for her to pick up . Don ’ t tell her she shouldn ’ t do it. ”
NIRV	Ruth	2	17	So Ruth picked up grain in the field until evening . Then she separated the barley from the straw . The barley weighed
NIRV	Ruth	2	30	pounds .
NIRV	Ruth	2	18	She carried it back to town . Her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered . Ruth also brought out the food left over from the lunch Boaz had given her . She gave it to Naomi .
NIRV	Ruth	2	19	Her mother-in-law asked her , “ Where did you pick up grain today ? Where did you work ? May the man who noticed you be blessed ! ” Then Ruth told her about the man whose field she had worked in . “ The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz , ” she said .
NIRV	Ruth	2	20	“ May the Lord bless him ! ” Naomi said to her daughter-in-law . “ The Lord is still being kind to those who are living and those who are dead. ” She continued , “ That man is a close relative of ours . He ’ s one of our family protectors. ”
NIRV	Ruth	2	21	Then Ruth , who was from Moab , said , “ He told me more . He even said , ‘ Stay with my workers until they have finished bringing in all my grain. ’ ”
NIRV	Ruth	2	22	Naomi replied to her daughter-in-law Ruth . She said , “ That will be good for you , my daughter . Go with the women who work for him . You might be harmed if you go to someone else ’ s field. ”
NIRV	Ruth	2	23	So Ruth stayed close to the women who worked for Boaz as she picked up grain . She worked until the time when all the barley and wheat had been harvested . And she lived with her mother-in-law . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ruth	3	3	So wash yourself . Put on some perfume . And put on your best clothes . Then go down to the threshing floor . But don ’ t let Boaz know you are there . Wait until he has finished eating and drinking .
NIRV	Ruth	3	2	You have been working with the women who work for Boaz . He ’ s a relative of ours . Tonight he ’ ll be separating the straw from his barley on the threshing floor .
NIRV	Ruth	3	4	Notice where he lies down . Then go over and uncover his feet . Lie down there . He ’ ll tell you what to do. ”
NIRV	Ruth	3	5	“ I ’ ll do everything you say , ” Ruth answered .
NIRV	Ruth	3	6	So she went down to the threshing floor . She did everything her mother-in-law had told her to do .
NIRV	Ruth	3	7	When Boaz had finished eating and drinking , he was in a good mood . He went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile . Then Ruth approached quietly . She uncovered his feet and lay down there .
NIRV	Ruth	3	8	In the middle of the night , something surprised Boaz and woke him up . He turned and found a woman lying there at his feet !
NIRV	Ruth	3	9	“ Who are you ? ” he asked . “ I ’ m Ruth , ” she said . “ You are my family protector . So take good care of me by making me your wife. ”
NIRV	Ruth	3	10	“ Dear woman , may the Lord bless you , ” he replied . “ You are showing even more kindness now than you did earlier . You didn ’ t run after the younger men , whether they were rich or poor .
NIRV	Ruth	3	11	Dear woman , don ’ t be afraid . I ’ ll do for you everything you ask . All the people of my town know that you are an excellent woman .
NIRV	Ruth	3	12	It ’ s true that I ’ m a relative of yours . But there ’ s a family protector who is more closely related to you than I am .
NIRV	Ruth	3	13	So stay here for the night . In the morning if he wants to help you , good . Let him help you . But if he doesn ’ t want to , then I ’ ll do it . You can be sure that the Lord lives . And you can be just as sure that I ’ ll help you . Lie down here until morning. ”
NIRV	Ruth	3	14	So she stayed at his feet until morning . But she got up before anyone could be recognized . Boaz thought , “ No one must know that a woman came to the threshing floor. ”
NIRV	Ruth	3	15	He said to Ruth , “ Bring me the coat you have around you . Hold it out. ” So she did . He poured more than fifty pounds of barley into it and helped her pick it up . Then he went back to town .
NIRV	Ruth	3	16	Ruth came to her mother-in-law . Naomi asked , “ How did it go , my daughter ? ” Then Ruth told her everything Boaz had done for her .
NIRV	Ruth	3	17	She said , “ He gave me all this barley . He said , ‘ Don ’ t go back to your mother-in-law with your hands empty. ’ ”
NIRV	Ruth	3	18	Naomi said , “ My daughter , sit down until you find out what happens . The man won ’ t rest until he settles the whole matter today. ” Copyright ©

If you are willing to buy it back , do it . But if you aren ’ t , tell me . Then I ’ ll know . No one has the right to buy it back except you . And I ’ m next in line. ” “ I ’ ll buy it , ” he said .
NIRV	Ruth	4	2	Boaz brought ten of the elders of the town together . He said , “ Sit down here. ” So they did .
NIRV	Ruth	4	3	Then he spoke to the family protector . He said , “ Naomi has come back from Moab . She ’ s selling the piece of land that belonged to our relative Elimelek .
NIRV	Ruth	4	5	Then Boaz said , “ When you buy the property from Naomi , you must also marry Ruth . She is from Moab and is the dead man ’ s widow . So you must marry her . That ’ s because his property must continue to belong to his family. ”
NIRV	Ruth	4	6	When the family protector heard that , he said , “ Then I can ’ t buy the land . If I did , I might put my own property in danger . So you buy it . I can ’ t do it. ”
NIRV	Ruth	4	7	In earlier times in Israel , there was a certain practice . It was used when family land was bought back and changed owners . The practice made the sale final . One person would take his sandal off and give it to the other . That was how people in Israel showed that a business matter had been settled .
NIRV	Ruth	4	8	So the family protector said to Boaz , “ Buy it yourself. ” And he took his sandal off .
NIRV	Ruth	4	9	Then Boaz said to the elders and all the people , “ Today you are witnesses . You have seen that I have bought land from Naomi . I have bought all the property that had belonged to Elimelek , Kilion and Mahlon .
NIRV	Ruth	4	10	I ’ ve also taken Ruth , who is from Moab , to become my wife . She is Mahlon ’ s widow . I ’ ve decided to marry her so the dead man ’ s name will stay with his property . Now his name won ’ t disappear from his family line or from his hometown . Today you are witnesses ! ”
NIRV	Ruth	4	11	Then the elders and all the people at the gate said , “ We are witnesses . The woman is coming into your home . May the Lord make her like Rachel and Leah . Together they built up the family of Israel . May you be an important person in Ephrathah . May you be famous in Bethlehem .
NIRV	Ruth	4	12	The Lord will give you children through this young woman . May your family be like the family of Perez . He was the son Tamar had by Judah. ” Naomi Gains a Son
NIRV	Ruth	4	13	So Boaz married Ruth . Then he slept with her . The Lord blessed her so that she became pregnant . And she had a son .
NIRV	Ruth	4	14	The women said to Naomi , “ We praise the Lord . Today he has provided a family protector for you . May this child become famous all over Israel !
NIRV	Ruth	4	15	He will make your life new again . He ’ ll take care of you when you are old . He ’ s the son of your very own daughter-in-law . She loves you . She is better to you than seven sons. ”
NIRV	Ruth	4	16	Then Naomi took the child in her arms and took care of him .
NIRV	Ruth	4	17	The women living there said , “ Naomi has a son ! ” They named him Obed . He was the father of Jesse . Jesse was the father of David .
NIRV	Ruth	4	18	Here is the family line of Perez . Perez was the father of Hezron .
NIRV	Ruth	4	19	Hezron was the father of Ram . Ram was the father of Amminadab .
NIRV	Ruth	4	20	Amminadab was the father of Nahshon . Nahshon was the father of Salmon .
NIRV	Ruth	4	21	Salmon was the father of Boaz . Boaz was the father of Obed .
NIRV	Ruth	4	22	Obed was the father of Jesse . And Jesse was the father of David . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	1	A certain man from Ramathaim in the hill country of Ephraim was named Elkanah . He was the son of Jeroham . Jeroham was the son of Elihu . Elihu was the son of Tohu . Tohu was the son of Zuph . Elkanah belonged to the family line of Zuph . Elkanah lived in the territory of Ephraim .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	2	Elkanah had two wives . One was named Hannah . The other was named Peninnah . Peninnah had children , but Hannah didn ’ t .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	3	Year after year Elkanah went up from his town to Shiloh . He went there to worship and sacrifice to the Lord who rules over all . Hophni and Phinehas served as priests of the Lord at Shiloh . They were the two sons of Eli .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	4	Every year at Shiloh , the day would come for Elkanah to offer a sacrifice . On that day , he would give a share of the meat to his wife Peninnah . He would also give a share to each of her sons and daughters .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	5	But he would give two shares of meat to Hannah . That ’ s because he loved her . He also gave her two shares because the Lord had kept her from having children .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	6	Peninnah teased Hannah to make her angry . She did it because the Lord had kept Hannah from having children .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	7	Peninnah teased Hannah year after year . Every time Hannah would go up to the house of the Lord , Elkanah ’ s other wife would tease her . She would keep doing it until Hannah cried and wouldn ’ t eat .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	8	Her husband Elkanah would say to her , “ Hannah , why are you crying ? Why don ’ t you eat ? Why are you so unhappy ? Don ’ t I mean more to you than ten sons ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	9	One time when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh , Hannah stood up . Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the Lord ’ s house .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	10	Hannah was very sad . She wept and wept . She prayed to the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	11	She made a promise to him . She said , “ Lord , you rule over all . Please see how I ’ m suffering ! Show concern for me ! Don ’ t forget about me ! Please give me a son ! If you do , I ’ ll give him back to the Lord . Then he will serve the Lord all the days of his life . He ’ ll never use a razor on his head . He ’ ll never cut his hair. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	12	As Hannah kept on praying to the Lord , Eli watched her lips .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	13	She was praying in her heart . Her lips were moving . But she wasn ’ t making a sound . Eli thought Hannah was drunk .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	14	He said to her , “ How long are you going to stay drunk ? Stop drinking your wine. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	15	“ That ’ s not true , sir , ” Hannah replied . “ I ’ m a woman who is deeply troubled . I haven ’ t been drinking wine or beer . I was telling the Lord all my troubles .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	16	Don ’ t think of me as an evil woman . I ’ ve been praying here because I ’ m very sad . My pain is so great. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	17	Eli answered , “ Go in peace . May the God of Israel give you what you have asked him for. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	18	She said , “ May you be pleased with me. ” Then she left and had something to eat . Her face wasn ’ t sad anymore .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	19	Early the next morning Elkanah and his family got up . They worshiped the Lord . Then they went back to their home in Ramah . Elkanah slept with his wife Hannah . And the Lord blessed her .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	20	So after some time , Hannah became pregnant . She had a baby boy . She said , “ I asked the Lord for him. ” So she named him Samuel . Hannah Gives Samuel to the Lord
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	21	Elkanah went up to Shiloh to offer the yearly sacrifice to the Lord . He also went there to keep a promise he had made . His whole family went with him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	22	But Hannah didn ’ t go . She said to her husband , “ When the boy doesn ’ t need me to breast-feed him anymore , I ’ ll take him to the Lord ’ s house . I ’ ll give him to the Lord there . He ’ ll stay there for the rest of his life. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	23	Her husband Elkanah told her , “ Do what you think is best . Stay here at home until Samuel doesn ’ t need you to breast-feed him anymore . May the Lord make his promise to you come true. ” So Hannah stayed home . She breast-fed her son until he didn ’ t need her milk anymore .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	24	When the boy didn ’ t need her to breast-feed him anymore , she took him with her to Shiloh . She took him there even though he was still very young . She brought him to the Lord ’ s house . She brought along a bull that was three years old . She brought
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	36	pounds of flour . She also brought a bottle of wine . The bottle was made out of animal skin .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	25	After the bull was sacrificed , Elkanah and Hannah brought the boy to Eli .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	26	Hannah said to Eli , “ Pardon me , sir . I ’ m the woman who stood here beside you praying to the Lord . And that ’ s just as sure as you are alive .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	27	I prayed for this child . The Lord has given me what I asked him for .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	1	28	So now I ’ m giving him to the Lord . As long as he lives he ’ ll be given to the Lord. ” And there Eli worshiped the Lord . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	2	“ There isn ’ t anyone holy like the Lord . There isn ’ t anyone except him . There isn ’ t any Rock like our God .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	3	“ Don ’ t keep talking so proudly . Don ’ t let your mouth say such proud things . The Lord is a God who knows everything . He judges everything people do .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	4	“ The bows of great heroes are broken . But those who trip and fall are made strong .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	5	Those who used to be full have to work for food . But those who used to be hungry aren ’ t hungry anymore . The woman who couldn ’ t have children has seven of them now . But the woman who has had many children is sad now because hers have died .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	6	“ The Lord causes people to die . He also gives people life . He brings people down to the grave . He also brings people up from death .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	7	The Lord makes people poor . He also makes people rich . He brings people down . He also lifts people up .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	8	He raises poor people up from the trash pile . He lifts needy people out of the ashes . He lets them sit with princes . He gives them places of honor . “ The foundations of the earth belong to the Lord . On them he has set the world .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	9	He guards the paths of his faithful servants . But evil people will lie silent in their dark graves . “ People don ’ t win just because they are strong .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	10	Those who oppose the Lord will be totally destroyed . The Most High God will thunder from heaven . The Lord will judge the earth from one end to the other . “ He will give power to his king . He will give honor to his anointed one. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	11	Then Elkanah went home to Ramah . But the boy Samuel served the Lord under the direction of Eli the priest . Eli ’ s Evil Sons
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	12	Eli ’ s sons were good for nothing . They didn ’ t honor the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	13	When any of the people came to offer a sacrifice , here is what the priests would do . While the meat was being boiled , the servant of the priest would come with a large fork in his hand .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	14	He would stick the fork into the pan or pot or small or large kettle . Then the priest would take for himself everything the fork brought up . That ’ s how Eli ’ s sons treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	15	Even before the fat was burned , the priest ’ s servant would come over . He would speak to the person who was offering the sacrifice . He would say , “ Give the priest some meat to cook . He won ’ t accept boiled meat from you . He ’ ll only accept raw meat. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	16	Sometimes the person would say to him , “ Let the fat be burned first . Then take what you want. ” But the servant would answer , “ No . Hand it over right now . If you don ’ t , I ’ ll take it away from you by force. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	17	That sin of Eli ’ s sons was very great in the Lord ’ s sight . That ’ s because they were not treating his offering with respect .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	18	But the boy Samuel served the Lord . He wore a sacred linen apron .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	19	Each year his mother made him a little robe . She took it to him when she went up to Shiloh with her husband . She did it when her husband went to offer the yearly sacrifice .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	20	Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife . He would say , “ May the Lord give you children by this woman . May they take the place of the boy she prayed for and gave to the Lord. ” Then they would go home .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	21	The Lord was gracious to Hannah . Over a period of years she had three more sons and two daughters . During that whole time the boy Samuel grew up serving the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	22	Eli was very old . He kept hearing about everything his sons were doing to all the Israelites . He also heard how his sons were sleeping with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	23	So Eli said to his sons , “ Why are you doing these things ? All the people are telling me about the evil things you are doing .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	24	No , my sons . The report I hear isn ’ t good . And it ’ s spreading among the Lord ’ s people .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	25	If a person sins against someone else , God can help that sinner . But if anyone sins against the Lord , who can help them ? ” In spite of what their father Eli said , his sons didn ’ t pay any attention to his warning . That ’ s because the Lord had already decided to put them to death .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	26	The boy Samuel continued to grow stronger . He also became more and more pleasing to the Lord and to people . Prophecy Against Eli ’ s Family
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	27	A man of God came to Eli . He told him , “ The Lord says , ‘ I made myself clearly known to your relatives who lived long ago . I did it when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh ’ s rule .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	28	At that time , I chose Aaron from your family line to be my priest . I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel . I told him to go up to my altar . I told him to burn incense . I chose him to wear a linen apron when he served me . I also gave his family all the food offerings presented by the Israelites .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	29	Why don ’ t you treat my sacrifices and offerings with respect ? I require them to be brought to the house where I live . Why do you honor your sons more than me ? Why do you fatten yourselves on the best parts of every offering that is made by my people Israel ? ’
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	30	“ The Lord is the God of Israel . He announced , ‘ I promised that members of your family line would serve me as priests forever. ’ But now the Lord announces , ‘ I will not let that happen ! I will honor those who honor me . But I will turn away from those who look down on me .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	31	The time is coming when I will cut your life short . I will also cut short the lives of those in your family line of priests . No one in your family line will grow old .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	32	You will see nothing but trouble in the house where I live . Good things will still happen to Israel . But no one in your family line will ever grow old .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	33	I will prevent the members of your family from serving me at my altar . I will destroy the eyesight of all of you I allow to live . I will also cause you to lose your strength . And everyone in your family line will die while they are still young .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	34	“ ‘ Something is going to happen to your two sons , Hophni and Phinehas . When it does , it will show you that what I am saying is true . They will both die on the same day .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	35	I will raise up for myself a faithful priest . He will do what my heart and mind want him to do . I will make his family line of priests very secure . They will always serve as priests to my anointed king .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	2	36	Everyone left in your family line will come and bow down to him . They will beg him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread . They will say , “ Please give me a place to serve among the priests . Then I can have food to eat. ” ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	3	Samuel was lying down in the Lord ’ s house . That ’ s where the ark of God was kept . The lamp of God was still burning .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	2	One night Eli was lying down in his usual place . His eyes were becoming so weak he couldn ’ t see very well .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	4	The Lord called out to Samuel . Samuel answered , “ Here I am. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	5	He ran over to Eli and said , “ Here I am . You called out to me. ” But Eli said , “ I didn ’ t call you . Go back and lie down. ” So he went and lay down .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	6	Again the Lord called out , “ Samuel ! ” Samuel got up and went to Eli . He said , “ Here I am . You called out to me. ” “ My son , ” Eli said , “ I didn ’ t call you . Go back and lie down. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	7	Samuel didn ’ t know the Lord yet . That ’ s because the Lord still hadn ’ t given him a message .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	8	The Lord called out for the third time . He said , “ Samuel ! ” Samuel got up and went to Eli . He said , “ Here I am . You called out to me. ” Then Eli realized that the Lord was calling the boy .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	9	So Eli told Samuel , “ Go and lie down . If someone calls out to you again , say , ‘ Speak , Lord . I ’ m listening. ’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	10	The Lord came and stood there . He called out , just as he had done the other times . He said , “ Samuel ! Samuel ! ” Then Samuel replied , “ Speak . I ’ m listening. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	11	The Lord said to Samuel , “ Pay attention ! I am about to do something terrible in Israel . It will make the ears of everyone who hears about it tingle .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	12	At that time I will do everything to Eli and his family that I said I would . I will finish what I have started .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	13	I told Eli I would punish his family forever . He knew his sons were sinning . He knew they were saying bad things about me . In spite of that , he did not stop them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	14	So I made a promise to the family of Eli . I said , ‘ The sins of Eli ’ s family will never be paid for by bringing sacrifices or offerings. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	15	Samuel lay down until morning . Then he opened the doors of the Lord ’ s house . He was afraid to tell Eli about the vision he had received .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	16	But Eli called out to him . He said , “ Samuel , my son. ” Samuel answered , “ Here I am. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	17	“ What did the Lord say to you ? ” Eli asked . “ Don ’ t hide from me anything he told you . If you do , may God punish you greatly. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	18	So Samuel told him everything . He didn ’ t hide anything from him . Then Eli said , “ He is the Lord . Let him do what he thinks is best. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	19	As Samuel grew up , the Lord was with him . He made everything Samuel said come true .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	20	So all the Israelites recognized that Samuel really was a prophet of the Lord . Everyone from Dan all the way to Beersheba knew it .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	3	21	The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh . There he made himself known to Samuel through the messages he gave him . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	4	So the people sent men to Shiloh . They brought back the ark of the Lord ’ s covenant law . He sits there on his throne between the cherubim . The Lord is the one who rules over all . Eli ’ s two sons , Hophni and Phinehas , were with the ark of God ’ s covenant law . The ark was in Shiloh .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	2	The Philistines brought their forces together to fight against Israel . As the fighting spread , the Israelites lost the battle to the Philistines . The Philistines killed about 4,000 of them on the field of battle .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	3	The rest of the Israelite soldiers returned to camp . Then the elders asked them , “ Why did the Lord let the Philistines win the battle over us today ? Let ’ s bring the ark of the Lord ’ s covenant from Shiloh . Let ’ s take it with us . Then the Lord will save us from the power of our enemies. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	5	The ark of the Lord ’ s covenant law was brought into the camp . Then all the Israelites shouted so loudly that the ground shook .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	6	The Philistines heard the noise . They asked , “ What ’ s all that shouting about in the Hebrew camp ? ” Then the Philistines found out that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	7	So they were afraid . “ A god has come into their camp , ” they said . “ Oh no ! Nothing like this has ever happened before .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	8	How terrible it will be for us ! Who will save us from the power of these mighty gods ? They struck down the people of Egypt in the desert . They sent all kinds of plagues on them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	9	Philistines , be strong ! Fight like men ! If you don ’ t , you will come under the control of the Hebrews . You will become their slaves , just as they have been your slaves . Fight like men ! ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	10	So the Philistines fought . The Israelites lost the battle , and every man ran back to his tent . A large number of them were killed . Israel lost 30,000 soldiers who were on foot .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	11	The ark of God was captured . And Eli ’ s two sons Hophni and Phinehas died . Eli Dies
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	12	That same day a man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the front lines of the battle . He went to Shiloh . His clothes were torn . He had dust on his head .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	13	When he arrived , there was Eli sitting on his chair . He was by the side of the road . He was watching because his heart was really concerned about the ark of God . The man entered the town and told everyone what had happened . Then the whole town cried out .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	14	Eli heard the people crying out . He asked , “ What ’ s the meaning of all this noise ? ” The man hurried over to Eli .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	15	Eli was
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	98	years old . His eyes were so bad he couldn ’ t see .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	16	The man told Eli , “ I ’ ve just come from the front lines of the battle . I just ran away from there today. ” Eli asked , “ What happened , son ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	17	The man who brought the news replied , “ Israel ran away from the Philistines . Large numbers of men in the army were wounded or killed . Your two sons Hophni and Phinehas are also dead . And the ark of God has been captured. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	18	When the man spoke about the ark of God , Eli fell backward off his chair . He had been sitting by the side of the gate . When he fell , he broke his neck and died . He was old and fat . He had led Israel for
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	40	years .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	19	The wife of Phinehas was pregnant . She was Eli ’ s daughter-in-law . It was near the time for her baby to be born . She heard the news that the ark of God had been captured . She heard that her father-in-law and her husband were dead . So she went into labor and had her baby . Her pain was more than she could bear .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	20	As she was dying , the women helping her spoke up . They said , “ Don ’ t be afraid . You have had a son. ” But she didn ’ t reply . She didn ’ t pay any attention .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	4	21	She named the boy Ichabod . She said , “ The God of glory has left Israel. ” She said it because the ark of God had been captured . She also said it because her father-in-law and her husband had died .

NIRV	1%20Samuel	5	5	That ’ s why to this day no one steps on the bottom part of the doorway of Dagon ’ s temple at Ashdod . Not even the priests of Dagon step there .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	5	2	They carried the ark into the temple of their god Dagon . They set it down beside the statue of Dagon .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	5	3	The people of Ashdod got up early the next day . They saw the statue of Dagon . There it was , lying on the ground ! It had fallen on its face in front of the ark of the Lord . So they picked up the statue of Dagon . They put it back in its place .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	5	4	But the following morning when they got up , they saw the statue of Dagon . There it was , lying on the ground again ! It had fallen on its face in front of the ark of the Lord . Its head and hands had been broken off . Only the body of the statue was left . Its head and hands were lying in the doorway of the temple .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	5	6	The Lord ’ s power was against the people of Ashdod and the settlements near it . He destroyed them . He made them suffer with growths in their bodies .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	5	7	The people of Ashdod saw what was happening . They said , “ The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us . His power is against us and against our god Dagon. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	5	8	So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines . They asked them , “ What should we do with the ark of the god of Israel ? ” The rulers answered , “ Have the ark moved to Gath. ” So they moved it .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	5	9	But after the people of Ashdod had moved the ark , the Lord ’ s power was against Gath . That threw its people into a great panic . The Lord made them break out with growths in their bodies . It happened to young people and old people alike .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	5	10	So the ark of God was sent to Ekron . As the ark was entering Ekron , the people of the city cried out . They shouted , “ They ’ ve brought the ark of the god of Israel to us . They want to kill us and our people. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	5	11	So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines . They said , “ Send the ark of the god of Israel away . Let it go back to its own place . If you don ’ t , it will kill us and our people. ” The death of so many people had filled the city with panic . God ’ s power was against the city .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	5	12	Those who didn ’ t die suffered with growths in their bodies . The people of Ekron cried out to heaven for help . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	6	Why are you stubborn , as Pharaoh and the people of Egypt were ? Israel ’ s god was very hard on them . Only then did they send the Israelites out . Only then did they let them go on their way .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	2	The Philistines called for the priests and for those who practice evil magic . They wanted their advice . They said to them , “ What should we do with the ark of the Lord ? Tell us how we should send it back to its place. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	3	They answered , “ If you return the ark of the god of Israel , don ’ t send it back to him without a gift . Be sure you send a guilt offering to their god along with it . Then you will be healed . You will find out why his power has continued to be against you. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	4	The Philistines asked , “ What guilt offering should we send to him ? ” Their advisers replied , “ There are five Philistine rulers . So send five gold rats . Also send five gold models of the growths in your bodies . Do it because the same plague has struck you and your rulers alike .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	5	Make models of the rats and the growths that are destroying the country . Give honor to Israel ’ s god . Then perhaps his power will no longer be against you , your gods and your land .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	7	“ Now then , get a new cart ready . Get two cows that have just had calves . Be sure the cows have never pulled a cart before . Tie the cart to them . But take their calves away and put them in a pen .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	8	Then put the ark of the Lord on the cart . Put the gold models in a chest beside the ark . Send them back to the Lord as a guilt offering . Send the cart on its way .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	9	But keep an eye on the cart . See if it goes up toward Beth Shemesh to its own territory . If it does , then it ’ s the Lord who has brought this horrible trouble on us . But if it doesn ’ t , then we ’ ll know it wasn ’ t his hand that struck us . We ’ ll know it happened to us by chance. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	10	So that ’ s what they did . They took the two cows and tied the cart to them . They put the calves in a pen .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	11	They placed the ark of the Lord on the cart . They put the chest there along with it . The chest held the gold models of the rats and of the growths .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	12	Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh . They stayed on the road . They were mooing all the way . They didn ’ t turn to the right or the left . The Philistine rulers followed them all the way to the border of Beth Shemesh .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	13	The people of Beth Shemesh were working in the valley . They were gathering their wheat crop . They looked up and saw the ark . When they saw it , they were filled with joy .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	14	The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh . It stopped there beside a large rock . The people chopped up the wood the cart was made out of . They sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	15	Some Levites had taken the ark of the Lord off the cart . They had also taken off the chest that held the gold models . They placed them on the large rock . On that day the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings to the Lord . They also made sacrifices to him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	16	The five Philistine rulers saw everything that happened . On that same day they returned to Ekron .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	17	The Philistines sent gold models of growths as a guilt offering to the Lord . There was one each for Ashdod , Gaza , Ashkelon , Gath and Ekron .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	18	They also sent five gold models of rats . There was one for each of the Philistine towns that belonged to the five rulers . Each of those towns had high walls around it . The towns also had country villages around them . The Levites set the ark of the Lord on the large rock . To this day the rock is a witness to what happened there . It ’ s in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	19	But some of the people of Beth Shemesh looked into the ark of the Lord . So he struck them down . He put
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	70	of them to death . The rest of the people were filled with sorrow . That ’ s because the Lord had killed so many of them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	20	The people of Beth Shemesh said , “ The Lord is a holy God . Who can stand in front of him ? Where can the ark go up to from here ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	6	21	Then messengers were sent to the people of Kiriath Jearim . The messengers said , “ The Philistines have returned the ark of the Lord . Come down and take it up to your town. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	1	So the men of Kiriath Jearim came and got the ark of the Lord . They brought it up to Abinadab ’ s house on the hill . They set his son Eleazar apart to guard the ark .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	7	The Philistines heard that Israel had gathered together at Mizpah . So the Philistine rulers came up to attack them . When the Israelites heard about it , they were afraid .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	2	The ark remained at Kiriath Jearim for a long time . It was there for a full
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	20	years . Samuel Brings the Philistines Under Israel ’ s Control Then all the Israelites turned back to the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	3	So Samuel spoke to all the Israelites . He said , “ Do you really want to return to the Lord with all your hearts ? If you do , get rid of your false gods . Get rid of your statues of female gods that are named Ashtoreth . Commit yourselves to the Lord . Serve him only . Then he will save you from the power of the Philistines. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	4	So the Israelites put away their statues of gods that were named Baal . They put away their statues of female gods that were named Ashtoreth . They served the Lord only .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	5	Then Samuel said , “ Gather all the Israelites together at Mizpah . I will pray to the Lord for you. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	6	When the people had come together at Mizpah , they went to the well and got water . They poured it out in front of the Lord . On that day they didn ’ t eat any food . They admitted they had sinned . They said , “ We ’ ve sinned against the Lord. ” Samuel was serving as the leader of Israel at Mizpah .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	8	They said to Samuel , “ Don ’ t stop crying out to the Lord our God to help us . Keep praying that he ’ ll save us from the power of the Philistines. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	9	Then Samuel got a very young lamb . He sacrificed it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord . He cried out to the Lord to help Israel . And the Lord answered his prayer .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	10	The Philistines came near to attack Israel . At that time Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering . But that day the Lord thundered loudly against the Philistines . He threw them into such a panic that the Israelites were able to chase them away .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	11	The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah . They chased the Philistines all the way to a point below Beth Kar . They killed them all along the way .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	12	Then Samuel got a big stone . He set it up between Mizpah and Shen . He named it Ebenezer . He said , “ The Lord has helped us every step of the way. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	13	So the Philistines were brought under Israel ’ s control . The Philistines didn ’ t attack their territory again . The Lord used his power against the Philistines as long as Samuel lived .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	14	The Philistines had captured many towns between Ekron and Gath . But they had to give all of them back . Israel took back the territories near those towns from the control of the Philistines . During that time Israel and the Amorites were friendly toward each other .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	15	Samuel continued to lead Israel all the days of his life .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	16	From year to year he traveled from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah . He served Israel as judge in all those places .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	7	17	But he always went back to Ramah . That ’ s where his home was . He served Israel as judge there too . And he built an altar there to honor the Lord . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	8	They are doing just as they have always done . They have deserted me and served other gods . They have done that from the time I brought them up out of Egypt until this day . Now they are deserting you too .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	2	The name of his oldest son was Joel . The name of his second son was Abijah . They served as judges at Beersheba .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	3	But his sons didn ’ t live as he did . They were only interested in making money . They accepted money from people who wanted special favors . They made things that were wrong appear to be right .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	4	So all the elders of Israel gathered together . They came to Samuel at Ramah .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	5	They said to him , “ You are old . Your sons don ’ t live as you do . So appoint a king to lead us . We want a king just like the kings all the other nations have. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	6	Samuel wasn ’ t pleased when they said , “ Give us a king to lead us. ” So he prayed to the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	7	The Lord told him , “ Listen to everything the people are saying to you . You are not the one they have turned their backs on . I am the one they do not want as their king .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	9	Let them have what they want . But give them a strong warning . Let them know what the king who rules over them will expect to be done for him. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	10	Samuel told the people who were asking him for a king everything the Lord had said .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	11	Samuel told them , “ Here ’ s what the king who rules over you will expect to be done for him . He will take your sons . He ’ ll make them serve with his chariots and horses . They will run in front of his chariots .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	12	He ’ ll choose some of your sons to be commanders of thousands of men . Some will be commanders of fifties . Others will have to plow his fields and gather his crops . Still others will have to make weapons of war and parts for his chariots .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	13	He ’ ll also take your daughters . Some will have to make perfume . Others will be forced to cook and bake .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	14	He will take away your best fields and vineyards and olive groves . He ’ ll give them to his attendants .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	15	He will take a tenth of your grain and a tenth of your grapes . He ’ ll give it to his officials and attendants .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	16	He will also take your male and female servants . He ’ ll take your best cattle and donkeys . He ’ ll use all of them any way he wants to .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	17	He will take a tenth of your sheep and goats . You yourselves will become his slaves .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	18	When that time comes , you will cry out for help because of the king you have chosen . But the Lord won ’ t answer you at that time. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	19	In spite of what Samuel said , the people refused to listen to him . “ No ! ” they said . “ We want a king to rule over us .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	20	Then we ’ ll be like all the other nations . We ’ ll have a king to lead us . He ’ ll go out at the head of our armies and fight our battles. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	21	Samuel heard everything the people said . He told the Lord about it .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	8	22	The Lord answered , “ Listen to them . Give them a king. ” Then Samuel said to the Israelites , “ Each of you go back to your own town. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	9	In Israel , prophets used to be called seers . So if someone wanted to ask God for advice , they would say , “ Come on . Let ’ s go to the seer. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	2	Kish had a son named Saul . Saul was a handsome young man . He was more handsome than anyone in Israel . And he was a head taller than anyone else .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	3	The donkeys that belonged to Saul ’ s father Kish were lost . So Kish spoke to his son Saul . He said , “ Go and look for the donkeys . Take one of the servants with you. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	4	Saul and his servant went through the hill country of Ephraim . They also went through the area around Shalisha . But they didn ’ t find the donkeys . So they went on into the area of Shaalim . But the donkeys weren ’ t there either . Then Saul went through the territory of Benjamin . But they still didn ’ t find the donkeys .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	5	When Saul and the servant with him reached the area of Zuph , Saul spoke to the servant . He said , “ Come on . Let ’ s go back . If we don ’ t , my father will stop thinking about the donkeys . Instead , he ’ ll start worrying about us. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	6	But the servant replied , “ There ’ s a man of God here in Ramah . People have a lot of respect for him . Everything he says comes true . So let ’ s go and see him now . Perhaps he ’ ll tell us which way to go. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	7	Saul said to his servant , “ If we go to see the man , what can we give him ? There isn ’ t any food in our sacks . We don ’ t have a gift for the man of God . So what can we give him ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	8	The servant answered Saul again . “ Look , ” he said . “ I ’ ve got a tenth of an ounce of silver . I ’ ll give it to the man of God . Then maybe he ’ ll tell us which way to go. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	10	Saul said to his servant , “ That ’ s a good idea . Come on . Let ’ s go and ask the seer. ” So they started out for the town where the man of God lived .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	11	They were going up the hill toward the town . Along the way they met some young women who were coming out to get water from the well . Saul and his servant asked them , “ Is the seer here ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	12	“ Yes , he is , ” they answered . “ In fact , he ’ s just up ahead of you . So hurry along . He has just come to our town today . The people are going to offer a sacrifice at the high place where they worship .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	13	As soon as you enter the town , you will find him . He ’ ll be there until he goes up to the high place to eat . The people won ’ t start eating until he gets there . He must bless the sacrifice first . After that , those who are invited will eat . So go on up . You should find him there just about now. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	14	They went up to the town . As they were entering it , they saw Samuel . He was coming toward them . He was on his way up to the high place .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	15	The Lord had spoken to Samuel the day before Saul came . He had said ,
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	16	“ About this time tomorrow I will send you a man . He is from the land of Benjamin . Anoint him to be the king of my people Israel . He will save them from the power of the Philistines . I have seen how much my people are suffering . Their cry for help has reached me. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	17	When Samuel saw a man coming toward him , the Lord spoke to Samuel again . He said , “ He is the man I told you about . His name is Saul . He will govern my people. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	18	Saul approached Samuel at the gate of the town . He asked Samuel , “ Can you please show me the seer ’ s house ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	19	“ I ’ m the seer , ” Samuel replied . “ Go on up to the high place ahead of me . I want you and your servant to eat with me today . Tomorrow morning I ’ ll tell you what ’ s on your mind . Then I ’ ll send you on your way .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	20	Don ’ t worry about the donkeys you lost three days ago . They ’ ve already been found . But who do all the Israelites want ? You and your father ’ s whole family ! ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	21	Saul answered , “ But I ’ m from the tribe of Benjamin . It ’ s the smallest tribe in Israel . And my family group is the least important in the whole tribe of Benjamin . So why are you saying that to me ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	22	Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the room where they would be eating . He seated them at the head table . About
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	30	people had been invited .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	23	Samuel said to the cook , “ Bring the piece of meat I gave you . It ’ s the one I told you to put to one side. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	24	So the cook went and got a choice piece of thigh . He set it in front of Saul . Samuel said , “ Here is what has been kept for you . Eat it . It was put to one side for you for this special occasion . We ’ ve saved it for you ever since I invited the guests. ” And Saul ate with Samuel that day .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	25	They came down from the high place to the town . After that , Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of Samuel ’ s house .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	26	The next day they got up at about the time the sun was rising . Samuel called out to Saul on the roof . He said , “ Get ready . Then I ’ ll send you on your way. ” So Saul got ready . And he and Samuel went outside together .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	9	27	As they were on their way down to the edge of town , Samuel spoke to Saul . He said , “ Tell the servant to go ahead of us. ” So the servant went on ahead . Then Samuel continued , “ Stay here for a while . I ’ ll give you a message from God. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	10	When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah , a group of prophets met Saul . Then the Spirit of God came powerfully on him . He prophesied along with them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	2	When you leave me today , you will meet two men . They will be near Rachel ’ s tomb at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin . They ’ ll say to you , ‘ The donkeys you have been looking for have been found . Now your father has stopped thinking about them . Instead , he ’ s worried about you . He ’ s asking , “ What can I do to find my son ? ” ’
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	3	“ You will go on from Zelzah until you come to the large tree at Tabor . Three men will meet you there . They ’ ll be on their way up to Bethel to worship God . One of them will be carrying three young goats . Another will be carrying three loaves of bread . A third will be carrying a bottle of wine . It will be a bottle made out of animal skin .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	4	The men will greet you . They ’ ll offer you two loaves of bread . You will accept the loaves from them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	5	“ After that , you will go to Gibeah of God . Some Philistine soldiers are stationed there . As you approach the town , you will meet a group of prophets . They ’ ll be coming down from the high place where they worship . People will be playing lyres , tambourines , flutes and harps at the head of the group . The prophets will be prophesying .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	6	The Spirit of the Lord will come powerfully on you . Then you will prophesy along with them . You will become a different person .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	7	All these things will happen . Then do what you want to do . God is with you .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	8	“ Go down ahead of me to Gilgal . You can be sure that I ’ ll come down to you there . I ’ ll come and sacrifice burnt offerings and friendship offerings . But you must wait there for seven days until I come to you . Then I ’ ll tell you what to do. ” Saul Becomes King of Israel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	9	As Saul turned to leave Samuel , God changed Saul ’ s heart . All these things happened that day .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	11	Those who had known Saul before saw him prophesying with the prophets . They asked one another , “ What has happened to the son of Kish ? Is Saul also one of the prophets ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	12	A man who lived in Gibeah answered , “ Yes , he is . In fact , he ’ s their leader. ” That ’ s why people say , “ Is Saul also one of the prophets ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	13	After Saul stopped prophesying , he went to the high place to worship .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	14	Later , Saul ’ s uncle spoke to him and his servant . He asked , “ Where have you been ? ” “ Looking for the donkeys , ” Saul said . “ But we couldn ’ t find them . So we went to Samuel. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	15	Saul ’ s uncle said , “ Tell me what Samuel said to you. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	16	Saul replied , “ He told us the donkeys had been found. ” But Saul didn ’ t tell his uncle that Samuel had said he would become king .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	17	Samuel sent a message to the Israelites . He told them to meet with the Lord at Mizpah .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	18	He said to them , “ The Lord is the God of Israel . He says , ‘ Israel , I brought you up out of Egypt . I saved you from their power . I also saved you from the power of all the kingdoms that had treated you badly. ’
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	19	But now you have turned your backs on your God . He saves you out of all your trouble and suffering . In spite of that , you have said , ‘ We refuse to listen . Place a king over us. ’ So now gather together to meet with the Lord . Do it tribe by tribe and family group by family group. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	20	Then Samuel had each tribe of Israel come forward . The tribe of Benjamin was chosen by casting lots .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	21	Next he had the tribe of Benjamin come forward , family group by family group . Matri ’ s group was chosen . Finally Saul , the son of Kish , was chosen . But when people looked for him , they realized he wasn ’ t there .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	22	They needed more help from the Lord . So they asked him , “ Has the man come here yet ? ” The Lord said , “ Yes . He has hidden himself among the supplies. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	23	So they ran over there and brought him out . When he stood up , the people saw that he was a head taller than any of them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	24	Samuel spoke to all the people . He said , “ Look at the man the Lord has chosen ! There isn ’ t anyone like him among all the people. ” Then the people shouted , “ May the king live a long time ! ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	25	Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of the king who ruled over them . He wrote them down in a book . He placed it in front of the Lord in the holy tent . Then he sent the people away . He sent each of them to their own homes .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	26	Saul also went to his home in Gibeah . Some brave men whose hearts God had touched went with Saul .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	10	27	But some people who wanted to stir up trouble said , “ How can this fellow save us ? ” They looked down on him . They didn ’ t bring him any gifts . But Saul kept quiet about it . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	11	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	11	11	The next day Saul separated his men into three groups . While it was still dark , they broke into the camp of the Ammonite army . They kept killing the men of Ammon until the hottest time of the day . Those who got away were scattered . There weren ’ t two of them left together anywhere . The People Agree to Have Saul as King
NIRV	1%20Samuel	11	2	Nahash , the king of Ammon , replied , “ I will make a peace treaty with you . But I ’ ll do it only on one condition . You must let me put out the right eye of every one of you . I want to bring shame on the whole nation of Israel. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	11	3	The elders of Jabesh said to him , “ Give us seven days to report back to you . We ’ ll send messengers all through Israel . If no one comes to save us , we ’ ll hand ourselves over to you. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	11	4	The messengers came to Gibeah of Saul . They reported to the people the terms Nahash had required . Then all the people wept out loud .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	11	5	Just then Saul was coming in from the fields . He was walking behind his oxen . He asked , “ What ’ s wrong with everyone ? Why are they weeping ? ” He was told what the men of Jabesh had said .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	11	6	When Saul heard their words , the Spirit of God came powerfully on him . He became very angry .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	11	7	He got a pair of oxen and cut them into pieces . He sent the pieces by messengers all through Israel . They announced , “ You must follow Saul and Samuel . If you don ’ t , this is what will happen to your oxen. ” The terror of the Lord fell on the people . So all of them came together with one purpose in mind .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	11	8	Saul brought his army together at Bezek . There were 300,000 men from Israel and 30,000 from Judah .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	11	9	The messengers who had come were told , “ Go back and report to the men of Jabesh Gilead . Tell them , ‘ By the hottest time of the day tomorrow , you will be rescued. ’ ” The messengers went and reported it to the men of Jabesh . It made those men very happy .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	11	10	They said to the people of Ammon , “ Tomorrow we ’ ll hand ourselves over to you . Then you can do to us whatever you like. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	11	12	The people said to Samuel , “ Who asked , ‘ Is Saul going to rule over us ? ’ Turn these men over to us . We ’ ll put them to death. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	11	13	But Saul said , “ No one will be put to death today ! After all , this is the day the Lord has rescued Israel. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	11	14	Then Samuel said to the people , “ Come on . Let ’ s go to Gilgal . There we ’ ll agree again to have Saul as our king. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	11	15	So all the people went to Gilgal . There , with the Lord as witness , they made Saul their king . There they sacrificed friendship offerings to the Lord . And there Saul and all the Israelites celebrated with great joy . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	12	“ But then you saw that Nahash , the king of Ammon , was about to attack you . So you said to me , ‘ No ! We want a king to rule over us. ’ You said it even though the Lord your God was your king .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	2	Now you have a king as your leader . But I ’ m old . My hair is gray . My sons are here with you . I ’ ve been your leader from the time I was young until this day .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	3	Here I stand . Bring charges against me if you can . The Lord is a witness . And so is his anointed king . Whose ox have I taken ? Whose donkey have I taken ? Have I cheated anyone ? Have I treated anyone badly ? Have I accepted money from anyone who wanted special favors ? If I ’ ve done any of these things , I ’ ll make it right. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	4	“ You haven ’ t cheated us , ” they replied . “ You haven ’ t treated us badly . You haven ’ t taken anything from anyone. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	5	Samuel said to them , “ The Lord is a witness against you this day . And so is his anointed king . They are witnesses that I haven ’ t taken anything from any of you. ” “ The Lord is a witness , ” they said .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	6	Then Samuel said to the people , “ The Lord appointed Moses and Aaron . He brought out of Egypt your people who lived long ago .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	7	Now then , stand here . I ’ m going to remind you of all the good things the Lord has done for you and your people . He is a witness .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	8	“ After Jacob ’ s family entered Egypt , they cried out to the Lord for help . The Lord sent Moses and Aaron . They brought your people out of Egypt . They had them make their homes in this land .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	9	“ But the people forgot the Lord their God . So he put them under the control of Sisera . Sisera was the commander of the army of Hazor . The Lord also put the Israelites under the control of the Philistines and the king of Moab . All those nations fought against Israel .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	10	So the people cried out to the Lord . They said , ‘ We have sinned . We ’ ve deserted the Lord . We ’ ve served gods that are named Baal . We ’ ve served female gods that are named Ashtoreth . But save us now from the power of our enemies . Then we will serve you. ’
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	11	The Lord sent Gideon , Barak , Jephthah and me . He saved you from the power of your enemies who were all around you . So you lived in safety .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	13	Now here is the king you have chosen . He ’ s the one you asked for . The Lord has placed a king over you .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	14	But you must have respect for the Lord . You must serve him and obey him . You must not say no to his commands . Both you and the king who rules over you must obey the Lord your God . If you do , that ’ s good .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	15	But you must not disobey him . You must not say no to his commands . If you do , his power will be against you . That ’ s what happened to your people who lived before you .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	16	“ So stand still . Watch the great thing the Lord is about to do right here in front of you !
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	17	It ’ s time to gather in the wheat , isn ’ t it ? I ’ ll call out to the Lord to send thunder and rain . Then you will realize what an evil thing you did in the sight of the Lord . You shouldn ’ t have asked for a king. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	18	Samuel called out to the Lord . That same day the Lord sent thunder and rain . So all the people had great respect for the Lord and for Samuel .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	19	They said to Samuel , “ Pray to the Lord your God for us . Pray that we won ’ t die because we asked for a king . That was an evil thing to do . We added it to all our other sins. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	20	“ Don ’ t be afraid , ” Samuel replied . “ It ’ s true that you have done all these evil things . But don ’ t turn away from the Lord . Serve him with all your heart .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	21	Don ’ t turn away and worship statues of gods . They are useless . They can ’ t do you any good . They can ’ t save you either . They are completely useless .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	22	But the Lord will be true to his great name . He won ’ t turn his back on his people . That ’ s because he was pleased to make you his own people .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	23	I would never sin against the Lord by failing to pray for you . I ’ ll teach you to live in a way that is good and right .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	24	But be sure to have respect for the Lord . Serve him faithfully . Do it with all your heart . Think about the great things he has done for you .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	12	25	But don ’ t be stubborn . Don ’ t continue to do what is evil . If you do , both you and your king will be destroyed. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	13	“ You have done a foolish thing , ” Samuel said . “ You haven ’ t obeyed the command the Lord your God gave you . If you had , he would have made your kingdom secure over Israel for all time to come .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	30	years old when he became king . He ruled over Israel for
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	42	years .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	2	Saul chose 3,000 of Israel ’ s men . Two thousand of them were with him at Mikmash and in the hill country of Bethel . One thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in the land of Benjamin . Saul sent the rest back to their homes .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	3	Some Philistine soldiers were stationed at Geba . Jonathan attacked them . The other Philistines heard about it . Saul announced , “ Let the Hebrew people hear about what has happened ! ” He had trumpets blown all through the land .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	4	So all the Israelites heard the news . They were told , “ Saul has attacked the Philistine army camp at Geba . Now the Philistines can ’ t stand the Israelites. ” The Israelites were called out to join Saul at Gilgal .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	5	The Philistines gathered together to fight against Israel . They had 3,000 chariots and 6,000 chariot drivers . Their soldiers were as many as the grains of sand on the seashore . They went up and camped at Mikmash . It was east of Beth Aven .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	6	The Israelites saw that their army was in deep trouble . So they hid in caves . They hid among bushes and rocks . They also hid in pits and empty wells .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	7	Some of them even went across the Jordan River . They went to the lands of Gad and Gilead . Saul remained at Gilgal . All the troops with him were shaking with fear .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	8	He waited seven days , just as Samuel had told him to . But Samuel didn ’ t come to Gilgal . And Saul ’ s men began to scatter .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	9	So he said , “ Bring me the burnt offering and the friendship offerings. ” Then he offered up the burnt offering .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	10	Just as Saul finished offering the sacrifice , Samuel arrived . Saul went out to greet him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	11	“ What have you done ? ” asked Samuel . Saul replied , “ I saw that the men were scattering . I saw that the Philistines were gathering together at Mikmash . You didn ’ t come when you said you would .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	12	So I thought , ‘ Now the Philistines will come down to attack me at Gilgal . And I haven ’ t asked the Lord for his blessing. ’ So I felt I had to sacrifice the burnt offering. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	14	But now your kingdom won ’ t last . The Lord has already looked for a man who is dear to his heart . He has appointed him king of his people . That ’ s because you haven ’ t obeyed the Lord ’ s command. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	15	Then Samuel left Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin . Saul counted the men who were with him . The total number was about
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	600	. Israel Doesn ’ t Have Weapons
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	16	Saul and his son Jonathan were staying in Gibeah in the land of Benjamin . The men who remained in the army were there with them . At the same time , the Philistines camped at Mikmash .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	17	Three groups of soldiers went out from the Philistine camp to attack Israel . One group turned and went toward Ophrah in the area of Shual .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	18	Another went toward Beth Horon . The third went toward the border that looked out over the Valley of Zeboim . That valley faces the desert .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	19	There weren ’ t any blacksmiths in the whole land of Israel . That ’ s because the Philistines had said , “ The Hebrews might hire them to make swords or spears ! ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	20	So all the Israelites had to go down to the Philistines . They had to go to them to get their plows , hoes , axes and sickles sharpened .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	21	It cost a fourth of an ounce of silver to sharpen a plow or a hoe . It cost an eighth of an ounce to sharpen a pitchfork or an axe . That ’ s also what it cost to put new tips on the large sticks used to drive oxen .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	13	22	So the Israelite soldiers went out to battle without swords or spears in their hands . That was true for all of Saul ’ s and Jonathan ’ s soldiers . Only Saul and his son Jonathan had those weapons . Jonathan Attacks the Philistines

NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	1	One day Jonathan , the son of Saul , spoke to the young man carrying his armor . “ Come on , ” he said . “ Let ’ s go over to the Philistine army camp on the other side of the pass. ” But he didn ’ t tell his father about it .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	14	In that first attack , Jonathan and the young man killed about
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	2	Saul was staying just outside Gibeah . He was under a pomegranate tree in Migron . He had about
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	600	men with him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	3	Ahijah was one of them . He was wearing a sacred linen apron . He was a son of Ichabod ’ s brother Ahitub . Ahitub was the son of Eli ’ s son Phinehas . Eli had been the Lord ’ s priest in Shiloh . No one was aware that Jonathan had left .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	4	Jonathan planned to go across the pass to reach the Philistine camp . But there was a cliff on each side of the pass . One cliff was called Bozez . The other was called Seneh .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	5	One cliff stood on the north side of the pass toward Mikmash . The other stood on the south side toward Geba .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	6	Jonathan spoke to the young man carrying his armor . He said , “ Come on . Let ’ s go over to the camp of those fellows who aren ’ t circumcised . Perhaps the Lord will help us . If he does , it won ’ t matter how many or how few of us there are . That won ’ t keep the Lord from saving us. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	7	“ Go ahead , ” the young man said . “ Do everything you have in mind . I ’ m with you all the way. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	8	Jonathan said , “ Come on , then . We ’ ll go across the pass toward the Philistines and let them see us .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	9	Suppose they say to us , ‘ Wait there until we come to you. ’ Then we ’ ll stay where we are . We won ’ t go up to them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	10	But suppose they say , ‘ Come up to us. ’ Then we ’ ll climb up . That will show us that the Lord has handed them over to us. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	11	So Jonathan and the young man let the soldiers in the Philistine camp see them . “ Look ! ” said the Philistines . “ Some of the Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	12	The men in the Philistine camp shouted to Jonathan and the young man carrying his armor . They said , “ Come on up here . We ’ ll teach you a thing or two. ” So Jonathan said to the young man , “ Climb up after me . The Lord has handed them over to Israel. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	13	Using his hands and feet , Jonathan climbed up . The young man was right behind him . Jonathan struck down the Philistines . The young man followed him and killed those who were still alive .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	20	Then Saul and all his men gathered together . They went to the battle . They saw that the Philistines were in total disorder . They were striking one another with their swords .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	15	Then panic struck the whole Philistine army . It struck those who were in the camp and those in the field . It struck those who were at the edge of the camp . It also struck those who were in the groups that had been sent out to attack Israel . The ground shook . It was a panic that God had sent .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	16	Saul ’ s lookouts at Gibeah in the land of Benjamin saw what was happening . They saw the Philistine army melting away in all directions .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	17	Then Saul spoke to the men with him . He said , “ Bring the troops together . See who has left our camp. ” When they did , they discovered that Jonathan and the young man carrying his armor weren ’ t there .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	18	Saul said to Ahijah the priest , “ Bring the ark of God. ” At that time it was with the Israelites .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	19	While Saul was talking to the priest , the noise in the Philistine camp got louder and louder . So Saul said to the priest , “ Stop what you are doing. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	21	At an earlier time some of the Hebrews had been on the side of the Philistines . They had gone up with them to their camp . But now they changed sides . They joined the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	22	Some of the Israelites had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim . They heard that the Philistines were running away . They quickly joined the battle and chased after them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	23	So on that day the Lord saved Israel . And the fighting continued on past Beth Aven . Jonathan Eats Honey
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	24	The Israelites became very hungry that day . That ’ s because Saul had forced the army to make a promise . He had said , “ None of you must eat any food before evening comes . You must not eat until I ’ ve paid my enemies back for what they did . If you do , may you be under a curse ! ” So none of the troops ate any food at all .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	25	The whole army entered the woods . There was honey on the ground .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	26	When they went into the woods , they saw the honey dripping out of a honeycomb . No one put any of the honey in his mouth . They were afraid of the curse that would come if they broke their promise .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	27	But Jonathan hadn ’ t heard that his father had forced the army to make a promise . Jonathan had a long stick in his hand . He reached out and dipped the end of it into the honeycomb . He put some honey in his mouth . It gave him new life .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	28	Then one of the soldiers told him , “ Your father forced the army to make a promise that everyone must obey . He said , ‘ None of you must eat any food today . If you do , may you be under a curse ! ’ That ’ s why the men are weak and ready to faint. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	29	Jonathan said , “ My father has made trouble for the country . See how I gained new life after I tasted a little of this honey .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	30	Our soldiers took food from their enemies today . Suppose they had eaten some of it . How much better off they would have been ! Even more Philistines would have been killed. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	31	That day the Israelites struck down the Philistines . They killed them from Mikmash to Aijalon . By that time they were tired and worn out .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	32	They grabbed what they had taken from their enemies . They killed some of the sheep , cattle and calves right there on the ground . They ate the meat while the blood was still in it .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	33	Then someone said to Saul , “ Look ! The men are sinning against the Lord . They ’ re eating meat that still has blood in it. ” Saul said to them , “ You have broken your promise . Roll a large stone over here at once. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	34	He continued , “ Go out among the men . Tell them , ‘ Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep . Kill them here and eat them . Don ’ t sin against the Lord by eating meat that still has blood in it. ’ ” So that night everyone brought the ox he had taken and killed it there .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	35	Then Saul built an altar to honor the Lord . It was the first time he had done that .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	36	Saul said , “ Let ’ s go down and chase after the Philistines tonight . Let ’ s not leave even one of them alive . Let ’ s take everything they have before morning. ” “ Do what you think is best , ” they replied . But the priest said , “ Let ’ s ask God for advice first. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	37	So Saul asked God , “ Should I go down and chase after the Philistines ? Will you hand them over to Israel ? ” But God didn ’ t answer him that day .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	38	Saul said to the leaders of the army , “ Come here . Let ’ s find out what sin has been committed today .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	39	The Lord is the one who rescues Israel . You can be sure that the Lord lives . And you can be just as sure that the sinner must die . He must die even if he ’ s my son Jonathan. ” But no one said anything .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	40	Then Saul said to all the Israelites , “ You stand over there . I and my son Jonathan will stand over here. ” “ Do what you think is best , ” they replied .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	41	Then Saul prayed to the Lord , the God of Israel . He said , “ Why haven ’ t you answered your servant today ? If I or my son Jonathan is to blame , answer with Urim . But if the Israelites are to blame , answer with Thummim. ” Jonathan and Saul were chosen by casting lots . The other men were cleared of blame .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	42	Saul said , “ Cast the lot to find out whether I or my son Jonathan is to blame. ” And Jonathan was chosen .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	43	Then Saul said to Jonathan , “ Tell me what you have done. ” So Jonathan told him , “ I used the end of my stick to get a little honey and taste it . And now do I have to die ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	44	Saul said , “ Jonathan , I must certainly put you to death . If I don ’ t , may God punish me greatly. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	45	But the men said to Saul , “ Should Jonathan be put to death ? Never ! He has saved Israel in a wonderful way . He did it today with God ’ s help . You can be sure that the Lord lives . And you can be just as sure that not even one hair on Jonathan ’ s head will fall to the ground. ” So the men rescued Jonathan . He wasn ’ t put to death .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	46	Then Saul stopped chasing the Philistines . They went back to their own land .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	47	After Saul became the king of Israel , he fought against Israel ’ s enemies who were all around them . He went to war against Moab , Ammon and Edom . He fought against the kings of Zobah and the Philistines . No matter where he went , he punished his enemies .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	48	He fought bravely . He won the battle over the Amalekites . He saved Israel from the power of those who had carried off what belonged to Israel . Saul ’ s Family
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	49	Saul ’ s sons were Jonathan , Ishvi and Malki-Shua . Saul ’ s older daughter was named Merab . His younger daughter was named Michal .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	50	Saul ’ s wife was named Ahinoam . She was the daughter of Ahimaaz . The commander of Saul ’ s army was named Abner . He was the son of Ner . Ner was Saul ’ s uncle .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	51	Saul ’ s father Kish and Abner ’ s father Ner were sons of Abiel .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	14	52	As long as Saul was king , he had to fight hard against the Philistines . So every time Saul saw a strong or brave man , he took him into his army . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	15	Saul answered , “ The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites . They spared the best of the sheep and cattle . They did it to sacrifice them to the Lord your God . But we totally destroyed everything else. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	2	The Lord who rules over all says , ‘ I will punish the Amalekites because of what they did to Israel . As the Israelites came up from Egypt , the Amalekites attacked them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	3	Now go . Attack the Amalekites . Completely destroy all that belongs to them . Do not spare the Amalekites . Put the men and women to death . Put the children and babies to death . Also kill the cattle , sheep , camels and donkeys. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	4	So Saul brought his men together at Telaim . The total number was 200,000 soldiers on foot from Israel and 10,000 from Judah .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	5	Saul went to the city of Amalek . Then Saul had some of his men hide and wait in the valley .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	6	Then Saul said to the Kenites , “ You were kind to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt . Get away from the Amalekites . Then I won ’ t have to destroy you along with them. ” So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	7	Saul attacked the Amalekites . He struck them down all the way from Havilah to Shur . Shur was near the eastern border of Egypt .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	8	Saul captured Agag , the king of the Amalekites . But he and his men totally destroyed with their swords all Agag ’ s people .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	9	So Saul and the army spared Agag . They spared the best of the sheep and cattle . They spared the fat calves and lambs . They spared everything that was valuable . They weren ’ t willing to completely destroy any of those things . But they totally destroyed everything that was worthless and weak .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	10	Then the Lord gave Samuel a message . He said ,
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	11	“ I am very sad I have made Saul king . He has turned away from me . He has not done what I directed him to do. ” When Samuel heard that , he was angry . He cried out to the Lord during that whole night .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	12	Early the next morning Samuel got up . He went to see Saul . But Samuel was told , “ Saul went to Carmel . There he set up a monument in his own honor . Now he has gone on down to Gilgal. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	13	When Samuel got there , Saul said , “ May the Lord bless you . I ’ ve done what he directed me to do. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	14	But Samuel said , “ Then why do I hear the baaing of sheep ? Why do I hear the mooing of cattle ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	16	“ That ’ s enough ! ” Samuel said to Saul . “ Let me tell you what the Lord said to me last night. ” “ Tell me , ” Saul replied .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	17	Samuel said , “ There was a time when you didn ’ t think you were important . But you became the leader of the tribes of Israel . The Lord anointed you to be king over Israel .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	18	He sent you to do something for him . He said , ‘ Go and completely destroy the Amalekites . Go and destroy those evil people . Fight against them until you have wiped them out. ’
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	19	Why didn ’ t you obey the Lord ? Why did you keep for yourselves what you had taken from your enemies ? Why did you do what is evil in the sight of the Lord ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	20	“ But I did obey the Lord , ” Saul said . “ I went to do what he sent me to do . I completely destroyed the Amalekites . I brought back Agag , their king .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	21	The soldiers took sheep and cattle from what had been taken from our enemies . They took the best of what had been set apart to God . They wanted to sacrifice them to the Lord your God at Gilgal. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	22	But Samuel replied , “ What pleases the Lord more ? Burnt offerings and sacrifices , or obeying the Lord ? It is better to obey than to offer a sacrifice . It is better to do what he says than to offer the fat of rams .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	23	Refusing to obey the Lord is as sinful as using evil magic . Being proud is as evil as worshiping statues of gods . You have refused to do what the Lord told you to do . So he has refused to have you as king. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	24	Then Saul said to Samuel , “ I have sinned . I ’ ve broken the Lord ’ s command . I haven ’ t done what you directed me to do . I was afraid of the men . So I did what they said I should do .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	25	Now I beg you , forgive my sin . Come back into town with me so I can worship the Lord. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	26	But Samuel said to him , “ I won ’ t go back with you . You have refused to do what the Lord told you to do . So he has refused to have you as king over Israel ! ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	27	Samuel turned to leave . But Saul grabbed the hem of his robe , and it tore .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	28	Samuel said to Saul , “ The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today . He has given it to one of your neighbors . He has given it to someone better than you .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	29	The God who is the Glory of Israel does not lie . He doesn ’ t change his mind . That ’ s because he isn ’ t a mere human being . If he were , he might change his mind. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	30	Saul replied , “ I have sinned . But please honor me in front of the elders of my people and in front of Israel . Come back with me so I can worship the Lord your God. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	31	So Samuel went back with Saul . And Saul worshiped the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	32	Then Samuel said , “ Bring me Agag , the king of the Amalekites. ” Agag was in chains when he came to Samuel . Agag thought , “ The time for me to be put to death must have passed by now. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	33	But Samuel said , “ Your sword has killed the children of other women . So the child of your mother will be killed. ” Samuel put Agag to death at Gilgal in front of the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	34	Then Samuel left to go to Ramah . But Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	15	35	Until the day Samuel died , he didn ’ t go to see Saul again . Samuel was filled with sorrow because of Saul . And the Lord was very sad he had made Saul king over Israel . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	5	Samuel replied , “ Yes , I ’ ve come in peace . I ’ ve come to offer a sacrifice to the Lord . Set yourselves apart to him and come to the sacrifice with me. ” Then he set Jesse and his sons apart to the Lord . He invited them to the sacrifice .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	6	When they arrived , Samuel saw Eliab . He thought , “ This has to be the one the Lord wants me to anoint for him. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	7	But the Lord said to Samuel , “ Do not consider how handsome or tall he is . I have not chosen him . The Lord does not look at the things people look at . People look at the outside of a person . But the Lord looks at what is in the heart. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	8	Then Jesse called for Abinadab . He had him walk in front of Samuel . But Samuel said , “ The Lord hasn ’ t chosen him either. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	9	Then Jesse had Shammah walk by . But Samuel said , “ The Lord hasn ’ t chosen him either. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	10	Jesse had seven of his sons walk in front of Samuel . But Samuel said to him , “ The Lord hasn ’ t chosen any of them. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	11	So he asked Jesse , “ Are these the only sons you have ? ” “ No , ” Jesse answered . “ My youngest son is taking care of the sheep. ” Samuel said , “ Send for him . We won ’ t sit down to eat until he arrives. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	12	So Jesse sent for his son and had him brought in . He looked very healthy . He had a fine appearance and handsome features . Then the Lord said , “ Get up and anoint him . This is the one. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	13	So Samuel got the animal horn that was filled with olive oil . He anointed David in front of his brothers . From that day on , the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully on David . Samuel went back to Ramah . David Serves Saul
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	14	The Spirit of the Lord had left Saul . And an evil spirit sent by the Lord terrified him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	15	Saul ’ s attendants said to him , “ An evil spirit sent by God is terrifying you .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	17	So Saul said to his attendants , “ Find someone who plays the harp well . Bring him to me. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	18	One of the servants said , “ I ’ ve seen someone who knows how to play the harp . He is a son of Jesse from Bethlehem . He ’ s a brave man . He would make a good soldier . He ’ s a good speaker . He ’ s very handsome . And the Lord is with him. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	19	Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse . He said , “ Send me your son David , the one who takes care of your sheep. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	20	So Jesse got some bread and a bottle of wine . The bottle was made out of animal skin . He also got a young goat . He loaded everything on the back of a donkey . He sent all of it to Saul with his son David .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	21	David went to Saul and began to serve him . Saul liked him very much . David became one of the men who carried Saul ’ s armor .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	22	Saul sent a message to Jesse . Saul said , “ Let David stay here . I want him to serve me . I ’ m pleased with him. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	16	23	When the evil spirit sent by God would come on Saul , David would get his harp and play it . That would help Saul . He would feel better , and the evil spirit would leave him . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	17	Jesse said to his son David , “ Get at least half a bushel of grain that has been cooked . Also get ten loaves of bread . Take all of it to your brothers . Hurry to their camp .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	2	Saul and the army of Israel gathered together . They camped in the Valley of Elah . They lined up their men to fight against the Philistines .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	3	The Philistine army was camped on one hill . Israel ’ s army was on another . The valley was between them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	4	A mighty hero named Goliath came out of the Philistine camp . He was from Gath . He was more than nine feet tall .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	5	He had a bronze helmet on his head . He wore bronze armor that weighed
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	125	pounds .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	6	On his legs he wore bronze guards . He carried a bronze javelin on his back .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	7	His spear was as big as a weaver ’ s rod . Its iron point weighed
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	15	But David went back and forth from Saul ’ s camp to Bethlehem . He went to Bethlehem to take care of his father ’ s sheep .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	8	Goliath stood there and shouted to the soldiers of Israel . He said , “ Why do you come out and line up for battle ? I ’ m a Philistine . You are servants of Saul . Choose one of your men . Have him come down and face me .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	9	If he ’ s able to fight and kill me , we ’ ll become your slaves . But if I win and kill him , you will become our slaves and serve us. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	10	Goliath continued , “ This day I dare the soldiers of Israel to send a man down to fight against me. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	11	Saul and the whole army of Israel heard what the Philistine said . They were terrified .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	12	David was the son of Jesse , who belonged to the tribe of Ephraim . Jesse was from Bethlehem in Judah . He had eight sons . When Saul was king , Jesse was already very old .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	13	Jesse ’ s three oldest sons had followed Saul into battle . The oldest son was Eliab . The second was Abinadab . The third was Shammah .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	14	David was the youngest . The three oldest sons followed Saul .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	16	Every morning and evening Goliath came forward and stood there . He did it for
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	40	Then David picked up his wooden staff . He went down to a stream and chose five smooth stones . He put them in the pocket of his shepherd ’ s bag . Then he took his sling in his hand and approached Goliath .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	18	Take along these ten chunks of cheese to the commander of their military group . Find out how your brothers are doing . Bring me back some word about them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	19	They are with Saul and all the men of Israel . They are in the Valley of Elah . They are fighting against the Philistines. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	20	Early in the morning David left his father ’ s flock in the care of a shepherd . David loaded up the food and started out , just as Jesse had directed . David reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions . The soldiers were shouting the war cry .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	21	The Israelites and the Philistines were lining up their armies for battle . The armies were facing each other .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	22	David left what he had brought with the man who took care of the supplies . He ran to the battle lines and asked his brothers how they were .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	23	As David was talking with them , Goliath stepped forward from his line . Goliath was a mighty Philistine hero from Gath . He again dared someone to fight him , and David heard it .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	24	Whenever Israel ’ s army saw Goliath , all of them ran away from him . That ’ s because they were so afraid .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	25	The Israelites had been saying , “ Just look at how this man keeps daring Israel to fight him ! The king will make the man who kills Goliath very wealthy . The king will also give his own daughter to be that man ’ s wife . The king won ’ t require anyone in the man ’ s family to pay any taxes in Israel. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	26	David spoke to the men standing near him . He asked them , “ What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine ? Goliath is bringing shame on Israel . What will be done for the one who removes it ? This Philistine isn ’ t even circumcised . He dares the armies of the living God to fight him . Who does he think he is ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	27	The men told David what Israel ’ s soldiers had been saying . The men told him what would be done for the man who killed Goliath .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	28	David ’ s oldest brother Eliab heard him speaking with the men . So Eliab became very angry with him . Eliab asked David , “ Why have you come down here ? Who is taking care of those few sheep in the desert for you ? I know how proud you are . I know how evil your heart is . The only reason you came down here was to watch the battle. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	29	“ What have I done now ? ” said David . “ Can ’ t I even speak ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	30	Then he turned away to speak to some other men . He asked them the same question he had asked before . And they gave him the same answer .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	31	Someone heard what David said and reported it to Saul . So Saul sent for David .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	32	David said to Saul , “ Don ’ t let anyone lose hope because of that Philistine . I ’ ll go out and fight him. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	33	Saul replied , “ You aren ’ t able to go out there and fight that Philistine . You are too young . He ’ s been a warrior ever since he was a boy. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	34	But David said to Saul , “ I ’ ve been taking care of my father ’ s sheep . Sometimes a lion or a bear would come and carry off a sheep from the flock .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	35	Then I would go after it and hit it . I would save the sheep it was carrying in its mouth . If it turned around to attack me , I would grab its hair . I would strike it down and kill it .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	36	In fact , I ’ ve killed both a lion and a bear . I ’ ll do the same thing to this Philistine . He isn ’ t even circumcised . He has dared the armies of the living God to fight him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	37	The Lord saved me from the paw of the lion . He saved me from the paw of the bear . And he ’ ll save me from the powerful hand of this Philistine too. ” Saul said to David , “ Go . And may the Lord be with you. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	38	Then Saul dressed David in his own military clothes . He put a coat of armor on him . He put a bronze helmet on his head .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	39	David put on Saul ’ s sword over his clothes . He walked around for a while in all that armor because he wasn ’ t used to it . “ I can ’ t go out there in all this armor , ” he said to Saul . “ I ’ m not used to it. ” So he took it off .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	41	At that same time , the Philistine kept coming closer to David . The man carrying Goliath ’ s shield walked along in front of him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	42	Goliath looked David over . He saw how young he was . He also saw how healthy and handsome he was . And he hated him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	43	He said to David , “ Why are you coming at me with sticks ? Do you think I ’ m only a dog ? ” The Philistine cursed David in the name of his gods .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	44	“ Come over here , ” he said . “ I ’ ll feed your body to the birds and wild animals ! ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	45	David said to Goliath , “ You are coming to fight against me with a sword , a spear and a javelin . But I ’ m coming against you in the name of the Lord who rules over all . He is the God of the armies of Israel . He ’ s the one you have dared to fight against .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	46	This day the Lord will give me the victory over you . I ’ ll strike you down . I ’ ll cut your head off . This day I ’ ll feed the bodies of the Philistine army to the birds and wild animals . Then the whole world will know there is a God in Israel .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	47	The Lord doesn ’ t rescue people by using a sword or a spear . And everyone here will know it . The battle belongs to the Lord . He will hand all of you over to us. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	48	As the Philistine moved closer to attack him , David ran quickly to the battle line to meet him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	49	He reached into his bag . He took out a stone . He put it in his sling . He slung it at Goliath . The stone hit him on the forehead and sank into it . He fell to the ground on his face .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	50	So David won the fight against Goliath with a sling and a stone . He struck down the Philistine and killed him . He did it without even using a sword .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	51	David ran and stood over him . He picked up Goliath ’ s sword and cut off his head with it . The Philistines saw that their hero was dead . So they turned around and ran away .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	52	Then the men of Israel and Judah shouted and rushed forward . They chased the Philistines to the entrance of Gath . They chased them to the gates of Ekron . Bodies of dead Philistines were scattered all along the road to Gath and Ekron . That ’ s the road that leads to Shaaraim .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	53	Israel ’ s army returned from chasing the Philistines . They had taken everything from the Philistine camp .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	54	David picked up Goliath ’ s head . He brought it to Jerusalem . He put Goliath ’ s weapons in his own tent .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	55	Saul had been watching David as he went out to meet the Philistine . He spoke to Abner , the commander of the army . Saul said to him , “ Abner , whose son is that young man ? ” Abner replied , “ Your Majesty , I don ’ t know . And that ’ s just as sure as you are alive. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	56	The king said , “ Find out whose son that young man is. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	57	After David killed Goliath , he returned to the camp . Then Abner brought him to Saul . David was still carrying Goliath ’ s head .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	17	58	“ Young man , whose son are you ? ” Saul asked him . David said , “ I ’ m the son of Jesse from Bethlehem. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	18	But David said to Saul , “ Who am I ? Is anyone in my whole family that important in Israel ? Am I worthy to become the king ’ s son-in-law ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	2	From that time on , Saul kept David with him . He didn ’ t let him return home to his family .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	3	Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him just as he loved himself .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	4	Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David . He also gave him his military clothes . He even gave him his sword , his bow and his belt .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	5	David did everything Saul sent him to do . He did it so well that Saul gave him a high rank in the army . That pleased Saul ’ s whole army , including his officers .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	6	After David had killed Goliath , the men of Israel returned home . The women came out of all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul . They danced and sang joyful songs . They played harps and tambourines .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	7	As they danced , they sang , “ Saul has killed thousands of men . David has killed tens of thousands. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	8	That song made Saul very angry . It really upset him . He said to himself , “ They are saying David has killed tens of thousands of men . But they are saying I ’ ve killed only thousands . The only thing left for him to get is the kingdom itself. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	9	From that time on , Saul watched David closely .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	10	The next day an evil spirit sent by God came powerfully on Saul . Saul began to prophesy in his house . At that same time David began to play the harp , just as he usually did . Saul was holding a spear .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	11	He threw it at David . As he did , he said to himself , “ I ’ ll pin David to the wall. ” But David got away from him twice .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	12	The Lord had left Saul and was with David . So Saul was afraid of David .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	13	He sent David away . He put him in command of 1,000 men . David led the troops in battle .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	14	In everything he did , he was very successful . That ’ s because the Lord was with him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	15	When Saul saw how successful David was , he became afraid of him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	16	But all the troops of Israel and Judah loved David . That ’ s because he led them in battle .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	17	Saul said to David , “ Here is my older daughter Merab . I ’ ll give her to you to be your wife . Just serve me bravely and fight the Lord ’ s battles. ” Saul said to himself , “ I won ’ t have to lift my hand to strike him down . The Philistines will do that ! ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	19	The time came for Saul to give his daughter Merab to David . Instead , Saul gave her to Adriel from Meholah to be his wife .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	20	Saul ’ s daughter Michal was in love with David . When they told Saul about it , he was pleased .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	21	“ I ’ ll give her to David to be his wife , ” Saul said to himself . “ Then maybe she ’ ll trap him . And maybe the Philistines will strike him down. ” So Saul said to David , “ Now you have a second chance to become my son-in-law. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	22	Then Saul gave an order to his attendants . He said , “ Speak to David in private . Tell him , ‘ The king likes you . All his attendants love you . So become his son-in-law. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	23	Saul ’ s attendants spoke those very words to David . But David said , “ Do you think it ’ s a small thing to become the king ’ s son-in-law ? I ’ m only a poor man . I ’ m not very well known. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	24	Saul ’ s attendants told him what David had said .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	25	Saul said , “ Tell David , ‘ Here ’ s the price the king wants for the bride . He wants you to kill
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	100	Philistines . Then bring back the skins you cut off when you circumcise them . That ’ s how Saul will get even with his enemies. ’ ” Saul hoped that the Philistines would strike David down .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	26	Saul ’ s attendants also told David those things . Then David was pleased to become the king ’ s son-in-law . So before the wedding day ,
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	27	David and his men went out and killed
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	200	Philistines . They circumcised the Philistines . Then David brought back all the skins . They counted out the full number and gave them to the king . By doing that , David could become the king ’ s son-in-law . So Saul gave David his daughter Michal to be his wife .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	28	Saul realized that the Lord was with David . He also realized that his daughter Michal loved David .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	29	So Saul became even more afraid of him . As long as Saul lived , he remained David ’ s enemy .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	18	30	The Philistine commanders kept on going out to battle . Every time they did , David had more success against them than the rest of Saul ’ s officers . So his name became well known . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	19	Saul was told , “ David is in Naioth at Ramah. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	2	So Jonathan warned him , “ My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you . Be very careful tomorrow morning . Find a place to hide and stay there .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	3	My father and I will come and stand in the field where you are hiding . I ’ ll speak to him about you . Then I ’ ll tell you what I find out. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	4	Jonathan told his father Saul some good things about David . He said to him , “ Please don ’ t do anything to harm David . He hasn ’ t done anything to harm you . And what he ’ s done has helped you a lot .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	5	He put his own life in danger when he killed Goliath . The Lord used him to win a great battle for the whole nation of Israel . When you saw it , you were glad . So why would you do anything to harm a man like David ? He isn ’ t guilty of doing anything to harm you . Why would you want to kill him without any reason ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	6	Saul paid attention to Jonathan . Saul made a promise . He said , “ You can be sure that the Lord lives . And you can be just as sure that David will not be put to death. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	7	So Jonathan sent for David and told him everything he and Saul had said . Then he brought David to Saul . David served Saul as he had done before .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	8	Once more war broke out . So David went out and fought against the Philistines . He struck them down with so much force that they ran away from him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	9	But an evil spirit sent by the Lord came on Saul . It happened as he was sitting in his house and holding his spear . While David was playing the harp ,
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	10	Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear . But David got away from him just as Saul drove the spear into the wall . That night David escaped .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	11	Saul sent some men to watch David ’ s house . He told them to kill David the next morning . But David ’ s wife Michal warned him . She said , “ You must run for your life tonight . If you don ’ t , tomorrow you will be killed. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	12	So Michal helped David escape through a window . He ran and got away .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	13	Then Michal got a statue of a god . She laid it on David ’ s bed . She covered it with clothes . And she put some goat hair at the place where David ’ s head would have been .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	14	Saul sent the men to capture David . But Michal told them , “ He ’ s sick. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	15	Then Saul sent the men back to see David . He told them , “ Bring him up here to me in his bed . Then I ’ ll kill him. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	16	But when the men entered , the only thing they found in the bed was the statue . Some goat hair was at the place where David ’ s head would have been .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	17	Saul said to Michal , “ Why did you trick me like this ? Why did you help my enemy escape ? ” Michal told him , “ He said to me , ‘ Help me get away . If you don ’ t , I ’ ll kill you. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	18	After David had run away and escaped , he went to Samuel at Ramah . He told him everything Saul had done to him . Then David and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	20	So Saul sent some men to capture him . When they got there , they saw a group of prophets who were prophesying . Samuel was standing there as their leader . Then the Spirit of God came on Saul ’ s men . So they also began to prophesy .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	21	Saul was told about it . So he sent some more men . They began to prophesy too . Saul sent some men a third time . And they also began to prophesy .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	22	Finally , Saul decided to go to Ramah himself . He went to the large well at Seku . He asked some people , “ Where are Samuel and David ? ” “ Over in Naioth at Ramah , ” they said .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	23	So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah . But the Spirit of God even came on him . He walked along and prophesied until he came to Naioth .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	19	24	There he took off his clothes . Then he also prophesied in front of Samuel . He lay there without his clothes on all that day and night . That ’ s why people say , “ Is Saul also one of the prophets ? ” Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	20	Wait by it . I ’ ll shoot three arrows to one side of the stone . I ’ ll pretend I ’ m practicing my shooting .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	2	“ That will never happen ! ” Jonathan replied . “ You aren ’ t going to die ! My father doesn ’ t do anything at all without letting me know . So why would he hide this from me ? He isn ’ t going to kill you ! ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	3	But David strongly disagreed . He said , “ Your father knows very well that you are pleased with me . He has said to himself , ‘ I don ’ t want Jonathan to know I ’ m planning to kill David . If he finds out , he ’ ll be very sad. ’ But I ’ m very close to being killed . And that ’ s just as sure as the Lord and you are alive. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	4	Jonathan said to David , “ I ’ ll do anything you want me to do for you. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	5	So David said , “ Tomorrow is the time for the New Moon feast . I ’ m supposed to eat with the king . But let me go and hide in the field . I ’ ll stay there until the evening of the day after tomorrow .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	6	Your father might miss me . If he does , then tell him , ‘ David begged me to let him hurry home to Bethlehem . A yearly sacrifice is being offered there for his whole family group. ’
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	7	Your father might say , ‘ That ’ s all right. ’ If he does , it will mean I ’ m safe . But he might become very angry . If he does , you can be sure he ’ s made up his mind to harm me .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	8	Please be kind to me . You have made a covenant with me in front of the Lord . If I ’ m guilty , kill me yourself ! Don ’ t hand me over to your father ! ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	9	“ I would never do that ! ” Jonathan said . “ Suppose I had even the smallest clue that my father had made up his mind to harm you . Then I would tell you. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	10	David asked , “ Who will tell me if your father answers you in a mean way ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	11	“ Come on , ” Jonathan said . “ Let ’ s go out to the field. ” So they went there together .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	12	Then Jonathan spoke to David . He said , “ I promise you that I ’ ll find out what my father is planning to do . I ’ ll find out by this time the day after tomorrow . The Lord , the God of Israel , is my witness . Suppose my father has kind feelings toward you . Then I ’ ll send you a message and let you know .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	13	But suppose he wants to harm you . And I don ’ t let you know about it . Suppose I don ’ t help you get away in peace . Then may the Lord punish me greatly . May he be with you , just as he has been with my father .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	14	But always be kind to me , just as the Lord is . Be kind to me as long as I live . Then I won ’ t be killed .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	15	And never stop being kind to my family . Don ’ t stop even when the Lord has cut off every one of your enemies from the face of the earth. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	16	So Jonathan made a covenant of friendship with David and his family . He said , “ May the Lord hold David ’ s enemies responsible for what they ’ ve done. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	17	Jonathan had David promise his friendship again because he loved him . In fact , Jonathan loved David just as he loved himself .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	18	Then Jonathan said to David , “ Tomorrow is the time for the New Moon feast . You will be missed , because your seat at the table will be empty .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	19	Go to the place where you hid when all this trouble began . Go there the day after tomorrow , when evening is approaching . There ’ s a stone out there called Ezel .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	21	Then I ’ ll send a boy out there . I ’ ll tell him , ‘ Go and find the arrows. ’ Suppose I say to him , ‘ The arrows are on this side of you . Bring them here. ’ Then come . That will mean you are safe . You won ’ t be in any danger . And that ’ s just as sure as the Lord is alive .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	22	But suppose I tell the boy , ‘ The arrows are far beyond you. ’ Then go . That will mean the Lord is sending you away .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	23	And remember what we talked about . Remember that the Lord is a witness between you and me forever. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	24	So David hid in the field . When the time for the New Moon feast came , the king sat down to eat .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	25	He sat in his usual place by the wall . Jonathan sat across from him . Abner sat next to Saul . But David ’ s place was empty .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	26	Saul didn ’ t say anything that day . He said to himself , “ Something must have happened to David to make him ‘ unclean. ’ That must be why he isn ’ t here. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	27	But the next day , David ’ s place was empty again . It was the second day of the month . Finally , Saul spoke to his son Jonathan . He said , “ Why hasn ’ t the son of Jesse come to the meal ? He hasn ’ t been here yesterday or today. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	28	Jonathan replied , “ David begged me to let him go to Bethlehem .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	29	He said , ‘ Let me go . Our family is offering a sacrifice in the town . My brother has ordered me to be there . Are you pleased with me ? If you are , let me go and see my brothers. ’ That ’ s why he hasn ’ t come to eat at your table. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	30	Saul became very angry with Jonathan . He said to him , “ You are an evil son . You have refused to obey me . I know that you are on the side of Jesse ’ s son . You should be ashamed of that . And your mother should be ashamed of having a son like you .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	31	You will never be king as long as Jesse ’ s son lives on this earth . And you will never have a kingdom either . So send someone to bring the son of Jesse to me . He must die ! ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	32	“ Why do you want to put him to death ? ” Jonathan asked his father . “ What has he done ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	33	But Saul threw his spear at Jonathan to kill him . Then Jonathan knew that his father wanted to kill David .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	34	So Jonathan got up from the table . He was very angry . On that second day of the feast , he refused to eat . He was very sad that his father was treating David so badly .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	35	The next morning Jonathan went out to the field to meet David . He took a young boy with him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	36	He said to the boy , “ Run and find the arrows I shoot. ” As the boy ran , Jonathan shot an arrow far beyond him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	37	The boy came to the place where Jonathan ’ s arrow had fallen . Then Jonathan shouted to him , “ The arrow went far beyond you , didn ’ t it ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	38	He continued , “ Hurry up ! Run fast ! Don ’ t stop ! ” The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	39	The boy didn ’ t know what was going on . Only Jonathan and David knew .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	40	Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy . He told him , “ Go back to town . Take the weapons with you. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	41	After the boy had gone , David got up from the south side of the stone . He bowed down in front of Jonathan with his face to the ground . He did it three times . Then they kissed each other and cried . But David cried more than Jonathan did .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	20	42	Jonathan said to David , “ Go in peace . In the name of the Lord we ’ ve promised to be friends . We have said , ‘ The Lord is a witness between you and me . He ’ s a witness between your children and my children forever. ’ ” Then David left , and Jonathan went back to the town . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	21	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	21	21	David went to Ahimelek the priest at Nob . Ahimelek trembled with fear when he met him . He asked David , “ Why are you alone ? Why isn ’ t anyone with you ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	21	2	David answered Ahimelek the priest , “ The king gave me a special job to do . He said to me , ‘ I don ’ t want anyone to know what I ’ m sending you to do . So don ’ t say anything about it. ’ I ’ ve told my men to meet me at a certain place .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	21	3	Do you have anything for us to eat ? Give me five loaves of bread , or anything else you can find. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	21	4	But the priest answered David , “ I don ’ t have any bread that isn ’ t holy . I only have some holy bread here . But it ’ s for men who haven ’ t slept with women recently. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	21	5	David replied , “ Well , we haven ’ t slept with women recently . That ’ s the way it is every time I lead my men out to battle . We keep ourselves holy even when we do jobs that aren ’ t holy . And that ’ s even more true today. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	21	6	So the priest gave him the holy bread . It was the only bread he had . It had been removed from the table that was in front of the Lord . On the same day , hot bread had been put in its place .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	21	7	One of Saul ’ s servants was there that day . He had been made to stay at the holy tent for a while . He was Doeg from Edom . Doeg was Saul ’ s chief shepherd .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	21	8	David asked Ahimelek , “ Don ’ t you have a spear or sword here ? I haven ’ t brought my sword or any other weapon . That ’ s because the job the king gave me to do had to be done right away. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	21	9	The priest replied , “ The sword of Goliath , the Philistine , is here . You killed him in the Valley of Elah . His sword is wrapped in a cloth . It ’ s behind the sacred linen apron . If you want it , take it . It ’ s the only sword here. ” David said , “ There isn ’ t any sword like it . Give it to me. ” David at Gath
NIRV	1%20Samuel	21	10	That day David ran away from Saul . He went to Achish , the king of Gath .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	21	11	But the servants of Achish spoke to him . They said , “ Isn ’ t this David , the king of the land ? Isn ’ t he the one the Israelites sing about when they dance ? They sing , “ ‘ Saul has killed thousands of men . David has killed tens of thousands. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	21	12	David paid close attention to what the servants were saying . He became very much afraid of what Achish , the king of Gath , might do .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	21	13	So he pretended to be out of his mind when he was with them . As long as he was in Gath , he acted like a crazy person . He made marks on the doors of the city gate . He let spit run down his beard .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	21	14	Achish said to his servants , “ Just look at the man ! He ’ s out of his mind ! Why are you bringing him to me ?
NIRV	1%20Samuel	21	15	Don ’ t I have enough crazy people around me already ? So why do you have to bring this fellow here ? Just look at how he ’ s carrying on in front of me ! Why do you have to bring this man into my house ? ” Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	22	Then David said to Abiathar , “ One day I was at Nob . I saw Doeg , the Edomite , there . I knew he would be sure to tell Saul . Your whole family has been killed . And I ’ m responsible for it .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	2	Everyone who was in trouble or owed money or was unhappy gathered around him . He became their commander . About
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	400	men were with him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	3	From there David went to Mizpah in Moab . He spoke to the king of Moab . He said , “ Please let my father and mother come and stay with you . Let them stay until I learn what God will do for me. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	4	So David left his parents with the king of Moab . They stayed with him as long as David was in his usual place of safety .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	5	But the prophet Gad spoke to David . He said , “ Don ’ t stay in your usual place of safety . Go into the land of Judah. ” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth . Saul Kills the Priests at Nob
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	6	Saul heard that the place where David and his men were hiding had been discovered . Saul was sitting under a tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah . He was holding his spear . All his officials were standing at his side .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	7	Saul said to them , “ Men of Benjamin , listen to me ! Do you think Jesse ’ s son will give all of you fields and vineyards ? Do you think he ’ ll make some of you commanders of thousands of men ? Do you think he ’ ll make the rest of you commanders of hundreds ?
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	8	Is that why all of you have joined together against me ? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with Jesse ’ s son . None of you is concerned about me . No one tells me that my son has stirred up Jesse ’ s son to hide and wait to attack me . But that ’ s exactly what ’ s happening now. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	9	Doeg was standing with Saul ’ s officials . He was from Edom . He said , “ I saw Jesse ’ s son David come to Ahimelek at Nob . Ahimelek is the son of Ahitub .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	10	Ahimelek asked the Lord a question for David . He also gave him food and the sword of Goliath , the Philistine. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	11	Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelek , the son of Ahitub . The king also sent for all the men in his family . They were the priests at Nob . All of them came to the king .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	12	Saul said , “ Son of Ahitub , listen to me. ” “ Yes , master , ” he answered .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	13	Saul said to him , “ Why have you and Jesse ’ s son joined together against me ? Why did you give him bread and a sword ? Why did you ask God a question for him ? Now he has turned against me . He is hiding and waiting to attack me right now. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	14	Ahimelek answered the king , “ David is faithful to you . In fact , he ’ s more faithful to you than anyone else who serves you . He ’ s your own son-in-law . He ’ s the captain of your own personal guards . He ’ s highly respected by everyone in your palace .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	15	Was that day the first time I asked God a question for him ? Of course not ! Please don ’ t bring charges against me . Please don ’ t bring charges against anyone in my family . I don ’ t know anything at all about this whole matter. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	16	But the king said , “ Ahimelek , you will certainly be put to death . You and your whole family will be put to death. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	17	Then the king gave an order to the guards at his side . He said , “ Go and kill the priests of the Lord . They are on David ’ s side too . They knew he was running away from me . And they didn ’ t even tell me. ” But the king ’ s officials wouldn ’ t raise a hand to strike down the priests of the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	18	Then the king ordered Doeg , “ You go and strike down the priests. ” So Doeg , the Edomite , went and struck them down . That day he killed
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	85	priests who wore linen aprons .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	19	He also killed the people of Nob with his sword . Nob was a town where priests lived . Doeg killed its men and women . He killed its children and babies . He also destroyed its cattle , donkeys and sheep .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	20	But Abiathar , a son of Ahimelek , escaped . Ahimelek was the son of Ahitub . Abiathar ran away and joined David .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	21	He told David that Saul had killed the priests of the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	22	23	So stay with me . Don ’ t be afraid . The man who wants to kill you wants to kill me too . You will be safe with me. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	23	Find out about all the hiding places he uses . Come back to me with all the facts . I ’ ll go with you . Suppose he ’ s in the area . Then I ’ ll track him down among all the family groups of Judah. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	2	So he asked the Lord for advice . He said , “ Should I go and attack those Philistines ? ” The Lord answered him , “ Go and attack them . Save Keilah. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	3	But David ’ s men said to him , “ We ’ re afraid here in Judah . Suppose we go to Keilah and fight against the Philistine army . Then we ’ ll be even more afraid. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	4	Once again David asked the Lord what he should do . The Lord answered him , “ Go down to Keilah . I am going to hand the Philistines over to you. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	5	So David and his men went to Keilah . They fought against the Philistines and carried off their livestock . David wounded and killed large numbers of Philistines . And he saved the people of Keilah .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	6	Abiathar , the son of Ahimelek , had brought down the sacred linen apron with him from Nob . He did it when he ran away to David at Keilah . Saul Chases David
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	7	Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah . He said , “ God has handed him over to me . David has trapped himself by entering a town that has gates with metal bars. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	8	So Saul brought together all his soldiers to go to battle . He ordered them to go down to Keilah . He told them to surround David and his men . He told them to get ready to attack them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	9	David learned that Saul was planning to attack him . So he said to Abiathar the priest , “ Bring the linen apron. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	10	Then David said , “ Lord , you are the God of Israel . I know for sure that Saul plans to come to Keilah . He plans to destroy the town because of me .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	11	Will the citizens of Keilah hand me over to him ? Will Saul come down here , as I ’ ve heard he would ? Lord , you are the God of Israel . Please answer me. ” The Lord said , “ He will come down. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	12	Again David asked , “ Will the citizens of Keilah hand me and my men over to Saul ? ” And the Lord said , “ They will. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	13	So David and his men left Keilah . The total number of them was about
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	600	. They kept moving from place to place . Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah . So he didn ’ t go there .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	14	Sometimes David stayed in places of safety in the desert . At other times he stayed in the hills of the Desert of Ziph . Day after day Saul looked for him . But God didn ’ t hand David over to him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	15	David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph . There he learned that Saul had come out to kill him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	16	Saul ’ s son Jonathan went to David at Horesh . He told David that God would make him strong .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	17	“ Don ’ t be afraid , ” he said . “ My father Saul won ’ t harm you . You will be king over Israel . And I will be next in command . Even my father Saul knows this. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	18	The two of them made a covenant of friendship in front of the Lord . Then Jonathan went home . But David remained at Horesh .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	19	The people of Ziph went up to Saul at Gibeah . They said , “ David is hiding among us . He ’ s hiding in places of safety at Horesh . Horesh is south of Jeshimon on the hill of Hakilah .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	20	Your Majesty , come down when it pleases you to come . It will be our duty to hand David over to you. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	21	Saul replied , “ May the Lord bless you because you were concerned about me .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	22	Make sure you are right . Go and check things out again . Find out where David usually goes . Find out who has seen him there . People tell me he ’ s very tricky .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	24	So they started out . They went to Ziph ahead of Saul . David and his men were in the Desert of Maon . Maon is south of Jeshimon in the Arabah Valley .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	25	Saul and his men started out to look for David . David was told about it . So he went down to a rock in the Desert of Maon to hide . Saul heard he was there . So he went into the Desert of Maon to chase David .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	26	Saul was going along one side of the mountain . David and his men were on the other side . They were hurrying to get away from Saul . Saul and his army were closing in on David and his men . They were about to capture them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	27	Just then a messenger came to Saul . He said , “ Come quickly ! The Philistines are attacking the land. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	28	So Saul stopped chasing David . He went to fight against the Philistines . That ’ s why they call that place Sela Hammahlekoth .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	23	29	David left that place . He went and lived in places of safety near En Gedi . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	24	Saul returned from chasing the Philistines . Then he was told , “ David is in the Desert of En Gedi. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	2	So Saul took 3,000 of the best soldiers from the whole nation of Israel . He started out to look for David and his men . He planned to look near the Rocky Cliffs of the Wild Goats .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	3	He came to some sheep pens along the way . A cave was there . Saul went in to go to the toilet . David and his men were far back in the cave .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	4	David ’ s men said , “ This is the day the Lord told you about . He said to you , ‘ I will hand your enemy over to you . Then you can deal with him as you want to. ’ ” So David came up close to Saul without being seen . He cut off a corner of Saul ’ s robe .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	5	Later , David felt sorry that he had cut off a corner of Saul ’ s robe .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	6	He said to his men , “ May the Lord keep me from doing a thing like that again to my master . He is the Lord ’ s anointed king . So I promise that I will never lay my hand on him . The Lord has anointed him. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	7	David said that to correct his men . He wanted them to know that they should never suggest harming the king . He didn ’ t allow them to attack Saul . So Saul left the cave and went on his way .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	8	Then David went out of the cave . He called out to Saul , “ King Saul ! My master ! ” When Saul looked behind him , David bowed down . He lay down flat with his face toward the ground .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	9	He said to Saul , “ Why do you listen when men say , ‘ David is trying to harm you ’ ?
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	10	This day you have seen with your own eyes how the Lord handed you over to me in the cave . Some of my men begged me to kill you . But I didn ’ t . I said , ‘ I will never lay my hand on my master . He is the Lord ’ s anointed king. ’
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	11	Look , my father ! Look at this piece of your robe in my hand ! I cut off the corner of your robe . But I didn ’ t kill you . See , there is nothing in my hand that shows I am guilty of doing anything wrong . I haven ’ t turned against you . I haven ’ t done anything to harm you . But you are hunting me down . You want to kill me .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	12	May the Lord judge between you and me . And may the Lord pay you back because of the wrong things you have done to me . But I won ’ t do anything to hurt you .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	13	People say , ‘ Evil acts come from those who do evil. ’ So I won ’ t do anything to hurt you .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	14	“ King Saul , who are you trying to catch ? Who do you think you are chasing ? I ’ m nothing but a dead dog or a flea !
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	15	May the Lord be our judge . May he decide between us . May he consider my case and stand up for me . May he show that I ’ m not guilty of doing anything wrong . May he save me from you. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	16	When David finished speaking , Saul asked him a question . He said , “ My son David , is that your voice ? ” And Saul wept out loud .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	17	“ You are a better person than I am , ” he said . “ You have treated me well . But I ’ ve treated you badly .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	18	You have just now told me about the good things you did to me . The Lord handed me over to you . But you didn ’ t kill me .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	19	Suppose a man finds his enemy . He doesn ’ t let him get away without harming him . May the Lord reward you with many good things . May he do it because of the way you treated me today .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	20	I know for sure that you will be king . I know that the kingdom of Israel will be made secure under your control .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	21	Now make a promise in the name of the Lord . Promise me that you won ’ t kill the children of my family . Also promise me that you won ’ t wipe out my name from my family line. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	24	22	So David made that promise to Saul . Then Saul returned home . But David and his men went up to his usual place of safety . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	25	Please don ’ t pay any attention to that evil man Nabal . His name means Foolish Person . And that ’ s exactly what he is . He ’ s always doing foolish things . I ’ m sorry I didn ’ t get a chance to see the men you sent .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	2	A certain man in Maon was very wealthy . He owned property there at Carmel . He had 1,000 goats and 3,000 sheep . He was clipping the wool off the sheep in Carmel .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	3	His name was Nabal . His wife ’ s name was Abigail . She was a wise and beautiful woman . But her husband was rude and mean in the way he treated others . He was from the family of Caleb .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	4	David was staying in the Desert of Paran . While he was there , he heard that Nabal was clipping the wool off his sheep .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	5	So he sent for ten young men . He said to them , “ Go up to Nabal at Carmel . Greet him for me .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	6	Say to him , ‘ May you live a long time ! May everything go well with you and your family ! And may things go well with everything that belongs to you !
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	7	“ ‘ I hear that you are clipping the wool off your sheep . When your shepherds were with us , we treated them well . The whole time they were at Carmel nothing that belonged to them was stolen .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	8	Ask your own servants . They ’ ll tell you . We ’ ve come to you now at a happy time of the year . Please be kind to my men . Please give me and my men anything you can find for us. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	9	When David ’ s men arrived , they gave Nabal the message from David . Then they waited .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	10	Nabal answered David ’ s servants , “ Who is this David ? Who is this son of Jesse ? Many servants are running away from their masters these days .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	11	Why should I give away my bread and water ? Why should I give away the meat I ’ ve prepared for those who clip the wool off my sheep ? Why should I give food to men who come from who knows where ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	12	So David ’ s men turned around and went back . When they arrived , they reported to David every word Nabal had spoken .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	13	David said to his men , “ Each of you put on your swords ! ” So they did . David put his sword on too . About
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	400	men went up with David . Two hundred men stayed behind with the supplies .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	14	One of the servants warned Abigail , Nabal ’ s wife . He said , “ David sent some messengers from the desert to give his greetings to our master . But Nabal shouted at them and was rude to them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	15	David ’ s men had been very good to us . They treated us well . The whole time we were near them out in the fields , nothing was stolen .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	16	We were taking care of our sheep near them . During that time , they were like a wall around us night and day . They kept us safe .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	17	Now think it over . See what you can do . Horrible trouble will soon come to our master and his whole family . He ’ s such an evil man that no one can even talk to him. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	18	Abigail didn ’ t waste any time . She got
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	200	cakes of pressed figs . She loaded all of it on the backs of donkeys .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	100	raisin cakes . And she got
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	19	Then she told her servants , “ Go on ahead . I ’ ll follow you. ” But she didn ’ t tell her husband Nabal about it .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	20	Abigail rode her donkey into a mountain valley . There she saw David and his men . They were coming down toward her .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	21	David had just said , “ Everything we ’ ve done hasn ’ t been worth a thing ! I watched over that fellow ’ s property in the desert . I made sure none of it was stolen . But he has paid me back evil for good .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	22	I won ’ t leave even one of his men alive until morning . If I do , may God punish me greatly ! ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	23	When Abigail saw David , she quickly got off her donkey . She bowed down in front of David with her face toward the ground .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	24	She fell at his feet . She said , “ Pardon your servant , sir . Please let me speak to you . Listen to what I ’ m saying . Let me take the blame myself .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	26	Sir , the Lord has kept you from killing Nabal and his men . He has kept you from using your own hands to get even . So may what ’ s about to happen to Nabal happen to all your enemies . May it happen to everyone who wants to harm you . And may it happen just as surely as the Lord your God and you are alive .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	27	I ’ ve brought a gift for you . Give it to the men who follow you .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	28	“ Please forgive me if I shouldn ’ t have done that . The Lord your God will certainly give you and your family line a kingdom that will last . That ’ s because you fight the Lord ’ s battles . You won ’ t do anything wrong as long as you live .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	29	Someone may chase you and try to kill you . But the Lord your God will keep your life safe like a treasure hidden in a bag . And he ’ ll destroy your enemies . Their lives will be thrown away , just as a stone is thrown from a sling .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	30	The Lord will do for you every good thing he promised to do . He ’ ll appoint you ruler over Israel .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	31	When that happens , you won ’ t have this heavy load on your mind . You won ’ t have to worry about how you killed people without any reason . You won ’ t have to worry about how you got even . The Lord your God will give you success . When that happens , please remember me. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	32	David said to Abigail , “ Give praise to the Lord . He is the God of Israel . He has sent you today to find me .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	33	May the Lord bless you for what you have done . You have shown a lot of good sense . You have kept me from killing Nabal and his men this day . You have kept me from using my own hands to get even .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	34	It ’ s a good thing you came quickly to meet me . If you hadn ’ t come , not one of Nabal ’ s men would have been left alive by sunrise . And that ’ s just as sure as the Lord , the God of Israel , is alive . He has kept me from harming you. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	35	Then David accepted from her what she had brought him . He said , “ Go home in peace . I ’ ve heard your words . I ’ ll do what you have asked. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	36	Abigail went back to Nabal . He was having a dinner party in the house . It was the kind of dinner a king would have . He had been drinking too much wine . He was very drunk . So she didn ’ t tell him anything at all until sunrise .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	37	The next morning Nabal wasn ’ t drunk anymore . Then his wife told him everything . When she did , his heart grew weak . He became like a stone .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	38	About ten days later , the Lord struck Nabal down . And he died .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	39	David heard that Nabal was dead . So he said , “ Give praise to the Lord . Nabal was rude to me . But the Lord stood up for me . He has kept me from doing something wrong . He has paid Nabal back for the wrong things he did. ” Then David sent a message to Abigail . He asked her to become his wife .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	40	His servants went to Carmel . They said to Abigail , “ David has sent us to you . He wants you to come back with us and become his wife. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	41	Abigail bowed down with her face toward the ground . She said , “ I am your servant . I ’ m ready to serve him . I ’ m ready to wash the feet of his servants. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	42	Abigail quickly got on a donkey and went with David ’ s messengers . Her five female servants went with her . She became David ’ s wife .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	43	David had also married Ahinoam from Jezreel . Both of them became his wives .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	25	44	But Saul had given his daughter Michal , David ’ s first wife , to Paltiel . Paltiel was from Gallim . He was the son of Laish . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	26	Some people from Ziph went to Saul at Gibeah . They said , “ David is hiding on the hill of Hakilah . It faces Jeshimon. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	2	So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph . He took 3,000 of the best soldiers in Israel with him . They went to the desert to look for David .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	3	Saul set up his camp beside the road . It was on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon . But David stayed in the desert . He saw that Saul had followed him there .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	4	So he sent out scouts . From them he learned that Saul had arrived .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	5	Then David started out . He went to the place where Saul had camped . He saw where Saul and Abner were lying down . Saul was lying inside the camp . The army was camped all around him . Abner was commander of the army . He was the son of Ner .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	6	Then David spoke to Ahimelek , the Hittite . He also spoke to Joab ’ s brother Abishai , the son of Zeruiah . He asked them , “ Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul ? ” “ I ’ ll go with you , ” said Abishai .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	7	So that night David and Abishai went into the camp . They found Saul lying asleep inside the camp . His spear was stuck in the ground near his head . Abner and the soldiers were lying asleep around him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	8	Abishai said to David , “ Today God has handed your enemy over to you . So let me pin him to the ground . I can do it with one jab of the spear . I won ’ t even have to strike him twice. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	9	But David said to Abishai , “ Don ’ t destroy him ! No one can do any harm to the Lord ’ s anointed king and not be guilty .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	10	You can be sure that the Lord lives , ” he said . “ And you can be just as sure that the Lord himself will strike Saul down . Perhaps he ’ ll die a natural death . Or perhaps he ’ ll go into battle and be killed .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	11	May the Lord keep me from doing anything to harm his anointed king . Now get the spear and water jug that are near his head . Then let ’ s leave. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	12	So David took the spear and water jug that were near Saul ’ s head . Then he and Abishai left . No one saw them . No one knew about what they had done . In fact , no one even woke up . Everyone was sleeping . That ’ s because the Lord had put them into a deep sleep .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	13	David went across to the other side of the valley . He stood on top of a hill far away from Saul ’ s camp . There was a wide space between them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	14	He called out to the army and to Abner , the son of Ner . He said , “ Abner ! Aren ’ t you going to answer me ? ” Abner replied , “ Who is calling out to the king ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	15	David said , “ You are a great soldier , aren ’ t you ? There isn ’ t anyone else like you in Israel . So why didn ’ t you guard the king ? He ’ s your master , isn ’ t he ? Someone came into the camp to destroy him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	16	You didn ’ t guard him . And that isn ’ t good . You can be sure that the Lord lives . And you can be just as sure that you and your men must die . That ’ s because you didn ’ t guard your master . He ’ s the Lord ’ s anointed king . Look around you . Where are the king ’ s spear and water jug that were near his head ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	17	Saul recognized David ’ s voice . He said , “ My son David , is that your voice ? ” David replied , “ Yes it is , King Saul , my master. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	18	He continued , “ Why are you chasing me ? What evil thing have I done ? What am I guilty of ?
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	19	King Saul , please listen to what I ’ m saying . Was it the Lord who made you angry with me ? If it was , may he accept my offering . Was it people who made you angry at me ? If it was , may the Lord see them cursed . They have driven me today from my share of the Lord ’ s land . By doing that , they might as well have said , ‘ Go and serve other gods. ’
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	20	Don ’ t spill my blood on the ground far away from where the Lord lives . King Saul , you have come out to look for nothing but a flea . It ’ s as if you were hunting a partridge in the mountains. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	21	Then Saul said , “ I have sinned . My son David , come back . Today you thought my life was very special . So I won ’ t try to harm you again . I ’ ve really acted like a foolish person . I ’ ve made a huge mistake. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	22	“ Here ’ s your spear , ” David answered . “ Send one of your young men over to get it .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	23	The Lord rewards everyone for doing what is right and being faithful . He handed you over to me today . But I wouldn ’ t harm you . You are the Lord ’ s anointed king .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	24	Today I thought your life had great value . In the same way , may the Lord think of my life as having great value . May he save me from all trouble. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	26	25	Then Saul said to David , “ May the Lord bless you , David my son . You will do great things . You will also have great success. ” So David went on his way . And Saul returned home . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	27	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	27	27	David thought , “ Some day Saul will destroy me . So the best thing I can do is escape . I ’ ll go to the land of the Philistines . Then Saul will stop looking for me everywhere in Israel . His hand won ’ t be able to reach me. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	27	2	So David and his
NIRV	1%20Samuel	27	600	men left Israel . They went to Achish , the king of Gath . He was the son of Maok .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	27	3	David and his men made their homes in Gath near Achish . Each of David ’ s men had his family with him . David had his two wives with him . They were Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail from Carmel . Abigail was Nabal ’ s widow .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	27	4	Saul was told that David had run away to Gath . So he didn ’ t look for David anymore .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	27	5	David said to Achish , “ If you are pleased with me , give me a place in one of your country towns . I can live there . I don ’ t really need to live near you in the royal city. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	27	6	So on that day Achish gave David the town of Ziklag . It has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since that time .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	27	7	David lived in Philistine territory for a year and four months .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	27	8	Sometimes David and his men would go up and attack the Geshurites . At other times they would attack the Girzites or the Amalekites . All those people had lived in the land that reached all the way to Shur and Egypt . They had been there for a long time .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	27	9	When David would attack an area , he wouldn ’ t leave a man or woman alive . But he would take their sheep , cattle , donkeys , camels and clothes . Then he would return to Achish .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	27	10	Achish would ask , “ Who did you attack today ? ” David would answer , “ The people who live in the Negev Desert of Judah. ” Or he would answer , “ The people in the Negev Desert of Jerahmeel. ” Or he would answer , “ The people in the Negev Desert of the Kenites. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	27	11	David wouldn ’ t leave a man or woman alive to be brought back to Gath . He thought , “ They might tell on us . They might tell Achish who we really attacked. ” That ’ s what David did as long as he lived in Philistine territory .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	27	12	Achish trusted David . He thought , “ David ’ s own people , the Israelites , can ’ t stand him anymore . So he ’ ll be my servant for life. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	28	While David was living in Ziklag , the Philistines gathered their army together . They planned to fight against Israel . Achish said to David , “ Here is what you must understand . You and your men must march out with me and my army. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	2	David said , “ I understand . You will see for yourself what I can do. ” Achish replied , “ All right . I ’ ll make you my own personal guard for life. ” Saul and the Woman at Endor
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	3	Samuel had died . The whole nation of Israel was filled with sorrow because he was dead . They had buried him in his own town of Ramah . Saul had thrown out of the land people who get messages from those who have died . He had also thrown out people who talk to the spirits of the dead .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	4	The Philistines gathered together and set up camp at Shunem . At the same time , Saul gathered together all the Israelites . They set up camp at Gilboa .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	5	When Saul saw the Philistine army , he was afraid . Terror filled his heart .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	6	He asked the Lord for advice . But the Lord didn ’ t answer him through dreams or prophets . He didn ’ t answer him when Saul had the priest cast lots by using the Urim .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	7	Saul spoke to his attendants . He said , “ Find me a woman who gets messages from those who have died . Then I can go and ask her some questions. ” “ There ’ s a woman like that in Endor , ” they said .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	8	Saul put on different clothes so people wouldn ’ t know who he was . At night he and two of his men went to see the woman . “ I want you to talk to a spirit for me , ” he said . “ Bring up the spirit of the dead person I choose. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	9	But the woman said to him , “ By now you must know what Saul has done . He has removed everyone who gets messages from those who have died . He has also removed everyone who talks to the spirits of the dead . He has thrown all of them out of the land . Why are you trying to trap me ? Why do you want to have me put to death ? ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	10	Saul made a promise in the name of the Lord . He said to the woman , “ You can be sure that the Lord lives . And you can be just as sure that you won ’ t be punished for helping me. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	11	Then the woman asked , “ Whose spirit should I bring up for you ? ” “ Bring Samuel up , ” he said .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	12	When the woman saw Samuel , she let out a loud scream . She said to Saul , “ Why have you tricked me ? You are King Saul ! ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	13	He said to her , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Tell me what you see. ” The woman said , “ I see a ghostly figure . He ’ s coming up out of the earth. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	14	“ What does he look like ? ” Saul asked . “ An old man wearing a robe is coming up , ” she said . Then Saul knew it was Samuel . He bowed down . He lay down flat with his face toward the ground .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	15	Samuel said to Saul , “ Why have you troubled me by bringing me up from the dead ? ” “ I ’ m having big problems , ” Saul said . “ The Philistines are fighting against me . God has left me . He doesn ’ t answer me anymore . He doesn ’ t speak to me through prophets or dreams . So I ’ ve called on you to tell me what to do. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	16	Samuel said , “ The Lord has left you . He has become your enemy . So why are you asking me what you should do ?
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	17	The Lord has spoken through me and has done what he said he would do . The Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hands . He has given it to one of your neighbors . He has given it to David .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	18	You didn ’ t obey the Lord . You didn ’ t show his great anger against the Amalekites by destroying them . So he ’ s punishing you today .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	19	He will hand both Israel and you over to the Philistines . Tomorrow you and your sons will be down here with me . The Lord will also hand Israel ’ s army over to the Philistines. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	20	Immediately Saul fell flat on the ground . What Samuel had said filled Saul with fear . His strength was gone . He hadn ’ t eaten anything all that day and all that night .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	21	The woman went over to Saul because she saw that he was very upset . She said , “ Look , I ’ ve obeyed you . I put my own life in danger by doing what you told me to do .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	22	So please listen to me . Let me give you some food . Eat it . Then you will have the strength to go on your way. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	23	But he refused . He said , “ I don ’ t want anything to eat. ” Then his men joined the woman in begging him to eat . Finally , he paid attention to them . He got up from the ground and sat on a couch .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	24	The woman had a fat calf at her house . She killed it at once . She got some flour . She mixed it and baked some bread that didn ’ t have any yeast in it .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	28	25	Then she set the food in front of Saul and his men . They ate it . That same night they got up and left . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	29	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	29	29	The Philistines gathered their whole army together at Aphek . Israel ’ s army camped by the spring of water at Jezreel .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	29	2	The Philistine rulers marched out in groups of hundreds and thousands . David and his men were marching with Achish behind the others .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	29	3	The commanders of the Philistines asked , “ Why are these Hebrews here ? ” Achish replied , “ That ’ s David , isn ’ t it ? Wasn ’ t he an officer of Saul , the king of Israel ? He has already been with me for more than a year . I haven ’ t found any fault in him . That ’ s been true from the day he left Saul until now. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	29	4	But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish . They said , “ Send David back . Let him return to the town you gave him . He must not go with us into battle . If he does , he ’ ll turn against us during the fighting . In fact , he might even cut off the heads of our own men . What better way could he choose to win back his master ’ s favor ?
NIRV	1%20Samuel	29	5	Isn ’ t David the one the Israelites sang about when they danced ? They sang , “ ‘ Saul has killed thousands of men . David has killed tens of thousands. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	29	6	So Achish called David over to him . He said , “ You have been faithful to me . And that ’ s just as sure as the Lord is alive . I would be pleased to have you serve with me in the army . I haven ’ t found any fault in you . That ’ s been true from the day you came to me until today . But the Philistine rulers aren ’ t pleased to have you come along .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	29	7	So now go back home in peace . Don ’ t do anything that wouldn ’ t please the Philistine rulers. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	29	8	“ But what have I done ? ” asked David . “ What have you found against me from the day I came to you until now ? Why can ’ t I go and fight against your enemies ? After all , you are my king and master. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	29	9	Achish answered , “ You have been as pleasing to me as an angel of God . But the Philistine commanders have said , ‘ We don ’ t want David to go up with us into battle. ’
NIRV	1%20Samuel	29	10	So get up early in the morning . Take with you the men who used to serve Saul . Leave as soon as the sun begins to come up. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	29	11	So David and his men got up early in the morning . They went back to the land of the Philistines . And the Philistines went up to Jezreel . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	30	He sent some to the elders in Hormah , Bor Ashan , Athak
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	2	They had captured the women and everyone else in Ziklag . They had taken as prisoners young people and old people alike . But they didn ’ t kill any of them . Instead , they carried them off as they went on their way .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	3	David and his men reached Ziklag . They saw that it had been destroyed by fire . They found out that their wives and sons and daughters had been captured .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	4	So David and his men began to weep out loud . They wept until they couldn ’ t weep anymore .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	5	David ’ s two wives had been captured . Their names were Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail from Carmel . Abigail was Nabal ’ s widow .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	6	David was greatly troubled . His men were even talking about killing him by throwing stones at him . All of them were very bitter because their sons and daughters had been taken away . But David was made strong by the Lord his God .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	7	Then David spoke to Abiathar the priest , the son of Ahimelek . He said , “ Bring me the linen apron. ” Abiathar brought it to him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	8	David asked the Lord for advice . He said , “ Should I chase after the men who attacked Ziklag ? If I do , will I catch up with them ? ” “ Chase after them , ” the Lord answered . “ You will certainly catch up with them . You will succeed in saving those who were captured. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	9	David and his
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	600	men came to the Besor Valley . Some of them stayed behind there .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	10	That ’ s because
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	200	men didn ’ t go out into battle with us . So we won ’ t share with them the goods we brought back . But each man can take his wife and children and go home. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	400	young men . They rode off on camels and got away .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	11	David ’ s men found an Egyptian in a field . They brought him to David . They gave him water to drink and food to eat .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	12	They gave him part of a cake of pressed figs . They also gave him two raisin cakes . After he ate them , he felt as good as new . That ’ s because he hadn ’ t eaten any food for three days and three nights . He hadn ’ t drunk any water during that time either .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	13	David asked him , “ Who do you belong to ? Where do you come from ? ” The man said , “ I ’ m from Egypt . I ’ m the slave of an Amalekite . My master deserted me when I became ill three days ago .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	14	We attacked the people in the Negev Desert of the Kerethites . We attacked the territory that belongs to Judah . We attacked the people in the Negev Desert of Caleb . And we burned Ziklag. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	15	David asked him , “ Can you lead me down to the men who attacked Ziklag ? ” He answered , “ Make a promise to me in the name of God . Promise that you won ’ t kill me . Promise that you won ’ t hand me over to my master . Then I ’ ll take you down to them. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	16	He led David down to where the men were . They were scattered all over the countryside . They were eating and drinking and dancing wildly . That ’ s because they had taken a large amount of goods from those they had attacked . They had taken it from the land of the Philistines and from the people of Judah .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	17	David fought against them from sunset until the evening of the next day . None of them escaped except
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	18	David got everything back that the Amalekites had taken . That included his two wives .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	19	Nothing was missing . Not one young person or old person or boy or girl was missing . None of the goods or anything else the Amalekites had taken was missing . David brought everything back .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	20	He brought back all the flocks and herds . His men drove them on ahead of the other livestock . They said , “ Here ’ s what David has captured. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	21	Then David came to the
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	22	But some of the men who had gone out with David were evil . They wanted to stir up trouble . They said , “ The
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	23	David replied , “ No , my friends . You must not hold back their share of what the Lord has given us . He has kept us safe . He has handed over to us the men who attacked us .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	24	So no one will pay any attention to what you are saying . Each man who stayed with the supplies will receive the same share as each man who went down to the battle . Everyone ’ s share will be the same. ”
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	25	David made that a law and a rule for Israel . It has been followed from that day until now .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	30	26	David reached Ziklag . He sent some of the goods to the elders of Judah . They were his friends . He said , “ Here ’ s a gift for you . It ’ s part of the things we took from the Lord ’ s enemies. ”

NIRV	1%20Samuel	31	1	Samuel
NIRV	1%20Samuel	31	31	The Philistines fought against the Israelites . The Israelites ran away from them . But many Israelites were killed on Mount Gilboa .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	31	2	The Philistines kept chasing Saul and his sons . They killed his sons Jonathan , Abinadab and Malki-Shua .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	31	3	The fighting was heavy around Saul . Men who were armed with bows and arrows caught up with him . They shot their arrows at him and wounded him badly .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	31	4	Saul spoke to the man carrying his armor . He said , “ Pull out your sword . Stick it through me . If you don ’ t , these fellows who aren ’ t circumcised will come . They ’ ll stick their swords through me and hurt me badly. ” But the man was terrified . He wouldn ’ t do it . So Saul took his own sword and fell on it .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	31	5	The man saw that Saul was dead . So he fell on his own sword and died with him .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	31	6	Saul and his three sons died together that same day . The man who carried his armor also died with them that day . So did all of Saul ’ s men .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	31	7	The Israelites who lived along the valley saw that their army had run away . So did those who lived across the Jordan River . They saw that Saul and his sons were dead . So they left their towns and ran away . Then the Philistines came and made their homes in them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	31	8	The day after the Philistines had won the battle , they came to take what they wanted from the dead bodies . They found Saul and his three sons dead on Mount Gilboa .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	31	9	So they cut off Saul ’ s head . They took his armor from his body . Then they sent messengers through the whole land of the Philistines . They announced the news in the temple where they had set up statues of their gods . They also announced it among their people .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	31	10	They put Saul ’ s armor in the temple where they had set up statues of female gods that were named Ashtoreth . They hung his body up on the wall of Beth Shan .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	31	11	The people of Jabesh Gilead heard about what the Philistines had done to Saul .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	31	12	So all their brave men marched through the night to Beth Shan . They took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth Shan . They brought them to Jabesh . There they burned them .
NIRV	1%20Samuel	31	13	Then they got the bones of Saul and his sons and buried them under a tamarisk tree at Jabesh . They didn ’ t eat anything for seven days . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	2	On the third day a man arrived from Saul ’ s camp . His clothes were torn . He had dust on his head . When he came to David , he fell to the ground to show him respect .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	1	After Saul died , David returned to Ziklag . He had won the battle over the Amalekites . He stayed in Ziklag for two days .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	3	“ Where have you come from ? ” David asked him . He answered , “ I ’ ve escaped from Israel ’ s camp. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	4	“ What happened ? ” David asked . “ Tell me. ” He said , “ Israel ’ s men ran away from the battle . Many of them were killed . Saul and his son Jonathan are dead. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	5	David spoke to the young man who brought him the report . He asked him , “ How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	6	“ I just happened to be there on Mount Gilboa , ” the young man said . “ Saul was there too . He was leaning on his spear . The enemy chariots and chariot drivers had almost caught up with him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	7	Then he turned around and saw me . He called out to me . I said , ‘ What do you want me to do ? ’
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	8	“ He asked me , ‘ Who are you ? ’ “ ‘ An Amalekite , ’ I answered .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	9	“ Then he said to me , ‘ Stand here by me and kill me ! I ’ m close to death , but I ’ m still alive. ’
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	10	“ So I stood beside him and killed him . I did it because I knew that after he had lost the battle he would be killed anyway . So I took the crown that was on his head . I also took his armband . I ’ ve brought them here to you . You are my master. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	11	Then David tore his clothes . And all his men tore their clothes .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	12	All of them were filled with sadness . They mourned over the whole nation of Israel . They didn ’ t eat anything until evening . That ’ s because Saul and Jonathan and the Lord ’ s army had been killed by swords .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	13	David spoke to the young man who had brought him the report . He asked , “ Where are you from ? ” “ I ’ m the son of an outsider , an Amalekite , ” he answered .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	14	David asked him , “ Why weren ’ t you afraid to lift your hand to kill the Lord ’ s anointed king ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	15	Then David called for one of his men . He said , “ Go ! Strike him down ! ” So he struck the man down , and the man died .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	16	That ’ s because David had said to him , “ Anything that happens to you will be your own fault . What your own mouth has spoken is a witness against you . You said , ‘ I killed the Lord ’ s anointed king. ’ ” David ’ s Song of Sadness About Saul and Jonathan
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	17	David sang a song of sadness about Saul and his son Jonathan .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	18	He ordered that it be taught to the people of Judah . It is a song that is played on a stringed instrument . It is written down in the Book of Jashar . David sang ,
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	19	“ Israel , a gazelle lies dead on your hills . Your mighty men have fallen .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	20	“ Don ’ t announce it in Gath . Don ’ t tell it in the streets of Ashkelon . If you do , the daughters of the Philistines will be glad . The daughters of men who haven ’ t been circumcised will be joyful .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	21	“ Mountains of Gilboa , may no dew or rain fall on you . May no showers fall on your hillside fields . The shield of the mighty king wasn ’ t respected there . The shield of Saul lies there . It isn ’ t rubbed with oil anymore .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	22	The bow of Jonathan didn ’ t turn back . The sword of Saul didn ’ t return without being satisfied . They spilled the blood of their enemies . They killed mighty men .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	23	“ When they lived , Saul and Jonathan were loved and respected . When they died , they were not parted . They were faster than eagles . They were stronger than lions .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	24	“ Daughters of Israel , mourn over Saul . He dressed you in the finest clothes . He decorated your clothes with ornaments of gold .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	25	“ Your mighty men have fallen in battle . Jonathan lies dead on your hills .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	26	My brother Jonathan , I ’ m filled with sadness because of you . You were very special to me . Your love for me was wonderful . It was more wonderful than the love of women .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	1	27	“ Israel ’ s mighty men have fallen . Their weapons of war are broken. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	2	So David went up there with his two wives . Their names were Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail from Carmel . Abigail was Nabal ’ s widow .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	3	David also took his men and their families with him . They made their homes in Hebron and its towns .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	4	Then the men of Judah came to Hebron . There they anointed David to be king over the people of Judah . David was told that the men from Jabesh Gilead had buried Saul ’ s body .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	5	So he sent messengers to them to speak for him . The messengers said , “ You were kind to bury the body of your master Saul . May the Lord bless you for that .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	6	And may he now be kind and faithful to you . David will treat you well for being kind to Saul ’ s body .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	7	Now then , be strong and brave . Your master Saul is dead . And the people of Judah have anointed David to be king over them. ” The Armies of David and Saul Fight Each Other
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	8	Abner , the son of Ner , was commander of Saul ’ s army . Abner had brought Saul ’ s son Ish-Bosheth to Mahanaim .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	9	There Abner made Ish-Bosheth king over Gilead , Ashuri and Jezreel . He also made him king over Ephraim , Benjamin and other areas of Israel .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	10	Ish-Bosheth was
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	40	years old when he became king over Israel . He ruled for two years . But the people of Judah remained faithful to David .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	11	David was king in Hebron over the people of Judah for seven and a half years .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	12	on David ’ s side .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	13	Joab , the son of Zeruiah , and David ’ s men also went out . All of them met at the pool in Gibeon . One group sat down on one side of the pool . The other group sat on the other side .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	14	Then Abner said to Joab , “ Let ’ s have some of the young men get up and fight . Let ’ s tell them to fight hand to hand in front of us. ” “ All right . Let them do it , ” Joab said .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	15	So the young men stood up and were counted off . There were
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	16	Each man grabbed one of his enemies by the head . Each one stuck his dagger into the other man ’ s side . And all of them fell down together and died . So that place in Gibeon was named Helkath Hazzurim .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	17	The fighting that day was very heavy . Abner and the Israelites lost the battle to David ’ s men .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	18	The three sons of Zeruiah were there . Their names were Joab , Abishai and Asahel . Asahel was as quick on his feet as a wild antelope .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	19	of David ’ s men were missing .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	20	Abner looked behind him . He asked , “ Asahel , is that you ? ” “ It is , ” he answered .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	21	Then Abner said to him , “ Turn to the right or the left . Fight one of the young men . Take his weapons away from him. ” But Asahel wouldn ’ t stop chasing him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	22	Again Abner warned Asahel , “ Stop chasing me ! If you don ’ t , I ’ ll strike you down . Then how could I look your brother Joab in the face ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	23	But Asahel refused to give up the chase . So Abner drove the dull end of his spear into Asahel ’ s stomach . The spear came out through his back . He fell and died right there on the spot . Every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	24	But Joab and Abishai chased Abner . As the sun was going down , they came to the hill of Ammah . It was near Giah on the way to the dry and empty land close to Gibeon .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	25	The men of Benjamin gathered in a group around Abner . They took their stand on top of a hill .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	26	Abner called out to Joab , “ Do you want our swords to keep on killing us off ? Don ’ t you know that all this fighting will end in bitter feelings ? How long will it be before you order your men to stop chasing their fellow Israelites ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	27	Joab answered , “ It ’ s a good thing you spoke up . If you hadn ’ t , the men would have kept on chasing them until morning . And that ’ s just as sure as God is alive. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	28	So Joab blew a trumpet . All the troops stopped . They didn ’ t chase Israel anymore . They didn ’ t fight anymore either .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	29	All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah Valley . They went across the Jordan River . All morning long they kept on going . Finally , they came to Mahanaim .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	30	Then Joab stopped chasing Abner . He gathered together the whole army . Besides Asahel , only
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	31	But David ’ s men had killed
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	360	men from Benjamin who were with Abner .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	2	32	They got Asahel ’ s body and buried it in his father ’ s tomb at Bethlehem . Then Joab and his men marched all night . They arrived at Hebron at sunrise . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	2	Sons were born to David in Hebron . His first son was Amnon . Amnon ’ s mother was Ahinoam from Jezreel .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	3	His second son was Kileab . Kileab ’ s mother was Abigail . She was Nabal ’ s widow from Carmel . The third son was Absalom . His mother was Maakah . She was the daughter of Talmai , the king of Geshur .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	4	The fourth son was Adonijah . His mother was Haggith . The fifth son was Shephatiah . His mother was Abital .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	5	The sixth son was Ithream . His mother was David ’ s wife Eglah . Those sons were born to David in Hebron . Abner Goes Over to David ’ s Side
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	6	The fighting continued between David ’ s royal house and Saul ’ s royal house . Abner gained more and more power in the royal house of Saul .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	7	While Saul was still alive , he had a concubine named Rizpah . She was the daughter of Aiah . Ish-Bosheth said to Abner , “ Why did you sleep with my father ’ s concubine ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	8	Abner was very angry because of what Ish-Bosheth said . So Abner answered , “ Do you think I ’ m only a dog ’ s head ? Am I on Judah ’ s side ? To this day I ’ ve been faithful to the royal house of your father Saul . I ’ ve been faithful to his family and friends . I haven ’ t handed you over to David . But now you claim that I ’ ve sinned with this woman !
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	9	I will do for David what the Lord promised him . If I don ’ t , may God punish me greatly .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	10	I ’ ll take the kingdom away from Saul ’ s royal house . I ’ ll set up the throne of David ’ s kingdom over Israel and Judah . He will rule from Dan all the way to Beersheba. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	11	Ish-Bosheth didn ’ t dare to say another word to Abner . He was much too afraid of him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	12	Then Abner sent messengers to David to speak for him . They said , “ Who will rule over this land ? Make a covenant with me . Then I ’ ll help you bring all the Israelites over to your side. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	13	“ Good , ” said David . “ I will make a covenant with you . But there ’ s one thing I want you to do . Bring Saul ’ s daughter Michal to me . Don ’ t come to see me unless she ’ s with you. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	14	Then David sent messengers to Saul ’ s son Ish-Bosheth . He ordered them to say , “ Give me my wife Michal . She was promised to me . I paid for her the price that was demanded . I paid for her with the skins of
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	100	circumcised Philistines. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	15	So Ish-Bosheth gave the order . He sent men who took Michal away from her husband Paltiel . Paltiel was the son of Laish .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	16	But her husband followed her to Bahurim . He was crying all the way . Then Abner said to him , “ Go back home ! ” So he did .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	17	Abner talked with the elders of Israel . He said , “ For some time you have wanted to make David your king .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	18	Now do it ! The Lord made a promise to David . He said , ‘ I will rescue my people Israel from the power of the Philistines . I will also rescue them from all their enemies . I will rescue them through my servant David. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	19	Abner also spoke to the people of Benjamin in person . Then he went to Hebron to tell David everything . He told him what Israel and all the people of Benjamin wanted to do .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	20	men with him . They came to David at Hebron . So David prepared a feast for Abner and his men .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	21	Then Abner said to David , “ Let me go right now . I ’ ll gather together all the Israelites for you . After all , you are now my king and master . The people can make a covenant with you . Then you can rule over everyone you want to. ” So David sent Abner away . And he went in peace . Joab Murders Abner
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	22	Just then David ’ s men and Joab came back from attacking their enemies . They brought with them the large amount of goods they had taken . But Abner wasn ’ t with David in Hebron anymore . That ’ s because David had sent him away , and he had gone in peace .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	23	Joab and all the soldiers with him arrived . Then he was told that Abner , the son of Ner , had come to see the king . He was told that the king had sent Abner away . He was also told that Abner had gone in peace .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	24	So Joab went to the king . He said , “ What have you done ? Abner came to you . Why did you let him get away ? Now he ’ s gone !
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	25	You know what Abner , the son of Ner , is like . He came to trick you . He wanted to watch your every move . He came to find out everything you are doing. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	26	Then Joab left David . He sent messengers to get Abner . They brought Abner back from the well of Sirah . But David didn ’ t know about it .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	27	When Abner returned to Hebron , Joab took him to one side . He brought him into an inside room . Joab acted as if he wanted to speak to him in private . But he really wanted to get even with him . That ’ s because Abner had spilled the blood of Joab ’ s brother Asahel . So Joab stabbed Abner in the stomach , and he died .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	28	Later on , David heard about it . He said , “ I and the people of my kingdom aren ’ t guilty of spilling the blood of Abner , the son of Ner . We are free of blame forever in the sight of the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	29	May Joab and his whole family line be held accountable for spilling Abner ’ s blood ! May Joab ’ s family never be without someone who has an open sore or skin disease . May his family never be without someone who has to use a crutch to walk . May his family never be without someone who gets killed by a sword . And may his family never be without someone who doesn ’ t have enough to eat. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	30	Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner . They did it because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	31	David spoke to Joab and all the people with him . He said , “ Tear your clothes . Put on the rough clothing people wear when they ’ re sad . Mourn when you walk in front of Abner ’ s body. ” King David himself walked behind it .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	32	Abner ’ s body was buried in Hebron . The king wept out loud at Abner ’ s tomb . So did the rest of the people .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	33	King David sang a song of sadness over Abner . He said , “ Should Abner have died as sinful people do ?
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	34	His hands were not tied . His feet were not chained . He died as if he had been killed by evil people. ” All the people mourned over Abner again .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	35	Then all of them came and begged David to eat something . They wanted him to eat while it was still day . But David made a promise . He said , “ I won ’ t taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down . If I do , may God punish me greatly ! ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	36	All the people heard his promise and were pleased . In fact , everything the king did pleased them .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	37	So on that day all the people there and all the Israelites understood . They knew that the king didn ’ t have anything to do with the murder of Abner , the son of Ner .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	38	The king spoke to his men . He said , “ Don ’ t you realize that a great commander has died in Israel today ?
NIRV	2%20Samuel	3	39	I ’ m the anointed king . But today I ’ m weak . These sons of Zeruiah are too powerful for me . May the Lord pay back the one who killed Abner ! May he pay him back for the evil thing he has done ! ” Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Samuel	4	2	Two men in Ish-Bosheth ’ s army led small fighting groups that attacked their enemies . The names of the men were Baanah and Rekab . They were sons of Rimmon from the town of Beeroth . Rimmon was from the tribe of Benjamin . Beeroth is considered to be part of Benjamin .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	4	4	Jonathan , the son of Saul , had a son named Mephibosheth . Both of Mephibosheth ’ s feet were hurt . He was five years old when the news that Saul and Jonathan had died came from Jezreel . His nurse picked him up and ran . But as she hurried to get away , he fell down . That ’ s how his feet were hurt .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	4	3	That ’ s because the people who used to live in Beeroth had run away to Gittaim . They have lived there as outsiders to this day .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	4	5	Rekab and Baanah started out for the house of Ish-Bosheth . They were the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth . They arrived there during the hottest time of the day . Ish-Bosheth was taking his early afternoon nap .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	4	6	Rekab and his brother Baanah went into the inside part of the house . They acted as if they were going to get some wheat . Instead , they stabbed Ish-Bosheth in the stomach . Then they slipped away .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	4	7	They had gone into the house while Ish-Bosheth was lying on his bed in his bedroom . They stabbed him and killed him . Then they cut off his head and took it with them . They traveled all night through the Arabah Valley .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	4	8	They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to King David at Hebron . They said to him , “ Here ’ s the head of Ish-Bosheth , the son of Saul . Saul was your enemy . He often tried to kill you . Today the Lord has paid back Saul and his family . He has let you get even with them . You are our king and master. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	4	9	David gave an answer to Rekab and his brother Baanah . They were the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth . David said , “ The Lord has saved me from every trouble .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	4	10	Someone once told me , ‘ Saul is dead. ’ He thought he was bringing me good news . But I grabbed him . I had him put to death in Ziklag . That ’ s the reward I gave him for his news ! And that ’ s just as sure as the Lord is alive .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	4	11	Now you evil men have killed a man in his own house . He hadn ’ t done anything wrong . You killed him while he was lying on his own bed . You spilled his blood . So shouldn ’ t I spill your blood ? Shouldn ’ t I wipe you off the face of the earth ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	4	12	Then David gave an order to his men . They killed Rekab and Baanah . They cut off their hands and feet . They hung their bodies by the pool in Hebron . But they buried the head of Ish-Bosheth in Abner ’ s tomb at Hebron . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	2	In the past , Saul was our king . But you led Israel on their military campaigns . And the Lord said to you , ‘ You will be the shepherd over my people Israel . You will become their ruler. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	5	In Hebron he ruled over Judah for seven and a half years . In Jerusalem he ruled over all of Israel and Judah for

NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	40	years .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	33	years . David Captures Jerusalem
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	6	The king and his men marched to Jerusalem . They went to attack the Jebusites who lived there . The Jebusites said to David , “ You won ’ t get in here . Even people who can ’ t see or walk can keep you from coming in. ” The Jebusites thought , “ David can ’ t get in here. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	7	But David captured the fort of Zion . It became known as the City of David .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	8	On that day David had said , “ Someone might win the battle over the Jebusites . But they will have to crawl through the water tunnel to get into the city . That ’ s the only way they can reach those enemies of mine that you say can ’ t see or walk. ” That ’ s why people say , “ Those who ‘ can ’ t see or walk ’ won ’ t enter David ’ s palace. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	9	David moved into the fort . He called it the City of David . He built up the area around the fort . He filled in the low places . He started at the bottom and worked his way up .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	10	David became more and more powerful . That ’ s because the Lord God who rules over all was with him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	11	Hiram was king of Tyre . He sent messengers to David . He sent cedar logs along with them . He also sent skilled workers . They worked with wood and stone . They built a palace for David .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	12	Then David knew that the Lord had made his position as king secure . He knew that he had made him king over the whole nation of Israel . He knew that the Lord had greatly honored his kingdom . The Lord had done it because the Israelites were his people .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	13	After David left Hebron , he got more concubines and wives in Jerusalem . More sons and daughters were born to him there .

NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	17	The Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel . So their whole army went to look for him . But David heard about it . He went down to his usual place of safety .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	18	The Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	19	So David asked the Lord for advice . He said , “ Should I go and attack the Philistines ? Will you hand them over to me ? ” The Lord answered him , “ Go . I will surely hand over the Philistines to you. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	20	So David went to Baal Perazim . There he won the battle over the Philistines . He said , “ The Lord has broken through against my enemies when I ’ ve attacked them . He has broken through just as water breaks through a dam. ” That ’ s why the place was called Baal Perazim .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	21	The Philistines left the statues of their gods there . So David and his men carried off the statues .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	22	Once more the Philistines came up . They spread out in the Valley of Rephaim .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	23	So David asked the Lord for advice . The Lord answered , “ Do not go straight up . Instead , circle around behind them . Attack them in front of the poplar trees .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	5	24	Listen for the sound of marching in the tops of the trees . Then move quickly . The sound will mean that I have gone out in front of you . I will strike down the Philistine army. ”

NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	2	He and all his men went to Baalah in Judah . They wanted to bring the ark of God up to Jerusalem from there . The ark is named after the Lord . He is the Lord who rules over all . He sits on his throne between the cherubim that are on the ark .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	6	They came to the threshing floor of Nakon . The oxen nearly fell there . So Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	3	The ark of God was placed on a new cart . Then it was brought from Abinadab ’ s house , which was on a hill . Uzzah and Ahio were guiding the cart . They were the sons of Abinadab .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	4	The ark of God was on the cart . Ahio was walking in front of it .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	5	David was celebrating with all his might in front of the Lord . So was the whole community of Israel . All of them were playing castanets , harps , lyres , tambourines , rattles and cymbals .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	7	Then the Lord was very angry with Uzzah . That ’ s because what Uzzah did showed that he didn ’ t have any respect for the Lord . So God struck him down . He died there beside the ark of God .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	8	David was angry because the Lord ’ s great anger had broken out against Uzzah . That ’ s why the place is still called Perez Uzzah to this day .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	9	David was afraid of the Lord that day . He asked , “ How can the ark of the Lord ever be brought to me ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	10	He didn ’ t want to take the ark of the Lord to be with him in the City of David . Instead , he took it to the house of Obed-Edom . Obed-Edom was from Gath .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	11	The ark of the Lord remained in Obed-Edom ’ s house for three months . And the Lord blessed him and his whole family .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	12	King David was told , “ The Lord has blessed the family of Obed-Edom . He has also blessed everything that belongs to him . That ’ s because the ark of God is in Obed-Edom ’ s house. ” So David went down there to bring up the ark . With great joy he brought it up from the house of Obed-Edom . He took it to the City of David .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	13	Those carrying the ark of the Lord took six steps forward . Then David sacrificed a bull and a fat calf .

NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	15	He did it while he was bringing up the ark of the Lord . The whole community of Israel helped him bring it up . They shouted . They blew trumpets .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	16	The ark of the Lord was brought into the City of David . Saul ’ s daughter Michal was watching from a window . She saw King David leaping and dancing in front of the Lord . That made her hate him in her heart .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	17	The ark of the Lord was brought into Jerusalem . It was put in its place in the tent David had set up for it . David sacrificed burnt offerings and friendship offerings to the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	18	After he finished sacrificing those offerings , he blessed the people in the name of the Lord who rules over all .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	19	He gave to each Israelite man and woman a loaf of bread . He also gave each one a date cake and a raisin cake . Then all the people went home .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	20	David returned home to bless his family . Saul ’ s daughter Michal came out to meet him . She said , “ You are the king of Israel . You have really brought honor to yourself today , haven ’ t you ? You have gone around half-naked right in front of the female slaves of your officials . You acted like a fool ! ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	21	David said to Michal , “ I did it to honor the Lord . He chose me instead of your father or anyone else in Saul ’ s family . The Lord appointed me ruler over his people Israel . I will celebrate to honor the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	22	And that ’ s not all . I will bring even less honor to myself . I will bring even more shame on myself . But those female slaves you spoke about will honor me. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	6	23	Saul ’ s daughter Michal didn ’ t have any children as long as she lived . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	2	Then the king spoke to Nathan the prophet . He said , “ Here I am , living in a house that has beautiful cedar walls . But the ark of God remains in a tent. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	7	I have moved from place to place with all the Israelites . I commanded their rulers to be shepherds over them . I never asked any of those rulers , ‘ Why haven ’ t you built me a house that has beautiful cedar walls ? ’ ” ’
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	3	Nathan replied to the king , “ Go ahead and do what you want to . The Lord is with you. ”

NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	5	“ Go and speak to my servant David . Tell him , ‘ The Lord says , “ Are you the one to build me a house to live in ?
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	6	I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt . But I have not lived in a house from then until now . I have been moving from place to place . I have been living in a tent .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	8	“ So tell my servant David , ‘ The Lord who rules over all says , “ I took you away from the grasslands . That ’ s where you were taking care of your father ’ s sheep and goats . I made you ruler over my people Israel .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	9	I have been with you everywhere you have gone . I have destroyed all your enemies . Now I will make you famous . Your name will be just as respected as the names of the most important people on earth .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	10	I will provide a place where my people Israel can live . I will plant them in the land . Then they will have a home of their own . They will not be bothered anymore . Evil people will no longer crush them , as they did at first .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	11	That is what your enemies have done ever since I appointed leaders over my people Israel . But I will give you peace and rest from all of them . “ ‘ “ I tell you that I , the Lord , will set up a royal house for you .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	12	Some day your life will come to an end . You will join the members of your family who have already died . Then I will make one of your own sons the next king after you . And I will make his kingdom secure .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	13	He is the one who will build a house where I will put my Name . I will set up the throne of his kingdom . It will last forever .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	14	I will be his father . And he will be my son . When he does what is wrong , I will use other men to beat him with rods and whips .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	15	I took my love away from Saul . I removed him from being king . You were there when I did it . But I will never take my love away from your son .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	16	Your royal house and your kingdom will last forever in my sight . Your throne will last forever. ” ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	17	Nathan reported to David all the words that the Lord had spoken to him . David ’ s Prayer to the Lord
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	18	Then King David went into the holy tent . He sat down in front of the Lord . He said , “ Lord and King , who am I ? My family isn ’ t important . So why have you brought me this far ?
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	19	I would have thought that you had already done more than enough for me . But now , Lord and King , you have also said what will happen to my royal house in days to come . And , my Lord and King , this promise is for a mere human being !
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	20	“ What more can I say to you ? Lord and King , you know all about me .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	21	You have done a wonderful thing . You have made it known to me . You have done it because that ’ s what you said you would do . It ’ s exactly what you wanted to do for me .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	22	“ Lord and King , how great you are ! There isn ’ t anyone like you . There isn ’ t any God but you . We have heard about it with our own ears .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	23	Who is like your people Israel ? God , we are the one nation on earth you have saved . You have set us free for yourself . Your name has become famous . You have done great and wonderful things . You have driven out nations and their gods to make room for your people . You saved us when you set us free from Egypt .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	24	You made Israel your very own people forever . Lord , you have become our God .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	7	25	“ And now , Lord God , keep forever the promise you have made to me and my royal house . Do exactly as you promised .

NIRV	2%20Samuel	9	9	Then the king sent for Saul ’ s servant Ziba . He said to him , “ I ’ m giving your master ’ s grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	9	3	The king asked , “ Isn ’ t there anyone still alive from the royal house of Saul ? God has been very kind to me .

NIRV	2%20Samuel	10	2	David thought , “ I ’ m going to be kind to Hanun . His father Nahash was kind to me. ” So David sent messengers to Hanun . He wanted them to tell Hanun how sad he was that Hanun ’ s father had died . David ’ s messengers went to the land of Ammon .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	10	10	He put the rest of the men under the command of his brother Abishai . Joab sent them to march out against the Ammonites .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	10	3	The Ammonite commanders spoke to their master Hanun . They said , “ David has sent messengers to tell you he is sad . They say he wants to honor your father . But the real reason they ’ ve come is to look the city over . They want to destroy it. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	10	4	So Hanun grabbed David ’ s messengers . He shaved off half of each man ’ s beard . He cut their clothes off just below the waist and left them half naked . Then he sent them away .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	10	5	David was told about it . So he sent messengers to his men because they were filled with shame . King David said to them , “ Stay at Jericho until your beards grow out again . Then come back here. ”

NIRV	2%20Samuel	10	11	He said , “ Suppose the Arameans are too strong for me . Then you must come and help me . But suppose the Ammonites are too strong for you . Then I ’ ll come and help you .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	10	12	Be strong . Let ’ s be brave as we fight for our people and the cities of our God . The Lord will do what he thinks is best. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	10	13	Then Joab and the troops with him marched out to attack the Arameans . They ran away from him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	10	14	The Ammonites realized that the Arameans were running away . So they ran away from Abishai . They went inside the city . After Joab had fought against the Ammonites , he went back to Jerusalem .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	10	15	The Arameans saw that they had been driven away by Israel . So they brought their troops together .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	10	16	Hadadezer had some Arameans brought from east of the Euphrates River . They went to Helam under the command of Shobak . He was the commander of Hadadezer ’ s army .

NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	2	One evening David got up from his bed . He walked around on the roof of his palace . From the roof he saw a woman taking a bath . She was very beautiful .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	11	Uriah said to David , “ The ark and the army of Israel and Judah are out there in tents . My commander Joab and your special troops are camped in the open country . How could I go to my house to eat and drink ? How could I go there and sleep with my wife ? I could never do a thing like that . And that ’ s just as sure as you are alive ! ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	3	David sent a messenger to find out who she was . The messenger returned and said , “ She is Bathsheba . She ’ s the daughter of Eliam . She ’ s the wife of Uriah . He ’ s a Hittite. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	4	Then David sent messengers to get her . She came to him . And he slept with her . Then she went back home . All of that took place after she had already made herself “ clean ” from her monthly period .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	5	Later , Bathsheba found out she was pregnant . She sent a message to David . She said , “ I ’ m pregnant. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	6	So David sent a message to Joab . David said , “ Send me Uriah , the Hittite. ” Joab sent him to David .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	7	Uriah came to David . David asked him how Joab and the soldiers were doing . He also asked him how the war was going .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	8	David said to Uriah , “ Go home and enjoy some time with your wife. ” So Uriah left the palace . Then the king sent him a gift .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	9	But Uriah didn ’ t go home . Instead , he slept at the entrance to the palace . He stayed there with all his master ’ s servants .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	10	David was told , “ Uriah didn ’ t go home. ” So he sent for Uriah . David said to him , “ You have been away for a long time . Why didn ’ t you go home ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	12	Then David said to him , “ Stay here one more day . Tomorrow I ’ ll send you back to the battle. ” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	13	David invited Uriah to eat and drink with him . David got him drunk . But Uriah still didn ’ t go home . In the evening he went out and slept on his mat . He stayed there among his master ’ s servants .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	14	The next morning David wrote a letter to Joab . He sent it along with Uriah .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	15	In it he wrote , “ Put Uriah out in front . That ’ s where the fighting is the heaviest . Then pull your men back from him . When you do , the Ammonites will strike him down and kill him. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	16	So Joab attacked the city . He put Uriah at a place where he knew the strongest enemy fighters were .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	17	The troops came out of the city . They fought against Joab . Some of the men in David ’ s army were killed . Uriah , the Hittite , also died .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	18	Joab sent David a full report of the battle .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	19	He told the messenger , “ Tell the king everything that happened in the battle . When you are finished ,
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	20	his anger might explode . He might ask you , ‘ Why did you go so close to the city to fight against it ? Didn ’ t you know that the enemy soldiers would shoot arrows down from the wall ?
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	21	Don ’ t you remember how Abimelek , the son of Jerub-Besheth , was killed ? A woman dropped a large millstone on him from the wall . That ’ s how he died in Thebez . So why did you go so close to the wall ? ’ If the king asks you that , tell him , ‘ And your servant Uriah , the Hittite , is also dead. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	22	The messenger started out for Jerusalem . When he arrived there , he told David everything Joab had sent him to say .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	23	The messenger said to David , “ The men in the city were more powerful than we were . They came out to fight against us in the open . But we drove them back to the entrance of the city gate .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	24	Then those who were armed with bows shot arrows at us from the wall . Some of your special troops were killed . Your servant Uriah , the Hittite , is also dead. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	25	David told the messenger , “ Tell Joab , ‘ Don ’ t get upset over what happened . Swords kill one person as well as another . So keep on attacking the city . Destroy it. ’ Tell that to Joab . It will cheer him up. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	26	Uriah ’ s wife heard that her husband was dead . She mourned over him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	11	27	When her time of sadness was over , David had her brought to his house . She became his wife . And she had a son by him . But the Lord wasn ’ t pleased with what David had done . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	12	You committed your sins in secret . But I will make sure that the man commits his sin in the middle of the day . Everyone in Israel will see it. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	3	But all the poor man had was one little female lamb . He had bought it . He raised it . It grew up with him and his children . It shared his food . It drank from his cup . It even slept in his arms . It was just like a daughter to him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	4	“ One day a traveler came to the rich man . The rich man wanted to prepare a meal for him . But he didn ’ t want to kill one of his own sheep or cattle . Instead , he took the little female lamb that belonged to the poor man . Then the rich man cooked it for the traveler who had come to him. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	5	David was very angry with the rich man . He said to Nathan , “ The man who did this must die ! And that ’ s just as sure as the Lord is alive .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	6	The man must pay back four times as much as that lamb was worth . How could he do such a thing ? And he wasn ’ t even sorry he had done it. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	7	Then Nathan said to David , “ You are the man ! The Lord , the God of Israel , says , ‘ I anointed you king over Israel . I saved you from Saul .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	8	I gave you everything that belonged to your master Saul . I even put his wives into your arms . I made you king over all the people of Israel and Judah . And if all of that had not been enough for you , I would have given you even more .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	9	Why did you turn your back on what I told you to do ? You did what is evil in my sight . You made sure that Uriah , the Hittite , would be killed in battle . You took his wife to be your own . You let the men of Ammon kill him with their swords .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	10	So time after time members of your own royal house will be killed with swords . That ’ s because you turned your back on me . You took the wife of Uriah , the Hittite , to be your own. ’
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	11	“ The Lord also says , ‘ I am going to bring trouble on you . It will come from your own family . I will take your wives away . Your own eyes will see it . I will give your wives to a man who is close to you . He will sleep with them in the middle of the day .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	13	Then David said to Nathan , “ I have sinned against the Lord. ” Nathan replied , “ The Lord has taken away your sin . You aren ’ t going to die .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	14	But you have dared to show great disrespect for the Lord . So the son who has been born to you will die. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	15	Nathan went home . Then the Lord made David ’ s child very sick . That was the child David had by Uriah ’ s wife .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	16	David begged God to heal the child . David didn ’ t eat anything . He spent his nights lying on the ground . He put on the rough clothes people wear when they ’ re sad .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	17	His most trusted servants stood beside him . They wanted him to get up from the ground . But he refused to do it . And he wouldn ’ t eat any food with them .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	18	On the seventh day the child died . David ’ s attendants were afraid to tell him the child was dead . They thought , “ While the child was still alive , we spoke to David . But he wouldn ’ t listen to us . So how can we now tell him the child is dead ? He might do something terrible to himself. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	19	David saw that his attendants were whispering to one another . Then he realized the child was dead . “ Has the child died ? ” he asked . “ Yes , ” they replied . “ He ’ s dead. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	20	Then David got up from the ground . After he washed himself , he put on lotions . He changed his clothes . He went into the house of the Lord and worshiped him . Then he went to his own house . He asked for some food . They served it to him . And he ate it .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	21	His attendants asked him , “ Why are you acting like this ? While the child was still alive , you wouldn ’ t eat anything . You cried a lot . But now that the child is dead , you get up and eat ! ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	22	He answered , “ While the child was still alive , I didn ’ t eat anything . And I cried a lot . I thought , ‘ Who knows ? The Lord might have mercy on me . He might let the child live. ’
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	23	But now he ’ s dead . So why should I continue to go without food ? Can I bring him back to life again ? Someday I ’ ll go to him . But he won ’ t return to me. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	24	Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba . He went to her and slept with her . Some time later she had a son . He was given the name Solomon . The Lord loved him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	25	So the Lord sent a message through Nathan the prophet . The Lord said , “ Name the boy Jedidiah. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	26	During that time , Joab fought against Rabbah . It was the royal city of the Ammonites . It had high walls around it . Joab was about to capture it .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	27	He sent messengers to David . He told them to say , “ I have fought against Rabbah . I ’ ve taken control of its water supply .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	28	So bring the rest of the troops together . Surround the city and get ready to attack it . Then capture it . If you don ’ t , I ’ ll capture it myself . Then it will be named after me. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	29	So David brought together the whole army and went to Rabbah . He attacked it and captured it .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	30	David took the gold crown off the head of the king of Ammon . Then the crown was placed on David ’ s head . The crown weighed
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	75	pounds . It had jewels in it . David took a huge amount of goods from the city .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	12	31	He brought out the people who were there . He made them work with saws and iron picks and axes . He forced them to make bricks . David did that to all the towns in Ammon . Then he and his entire army returned to Jerusalem . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	2	Amnon wanted his sister Tamar so much that it made him sick . She was a virgin , and it seemed impossible for him to do what he wanted with her .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	13	What about me ? How could I ever get rid of my shame ? And what about you ? You would be as foolish as any evil person in Israel . Please speak to the king . He won ’ t keep me from marrying you. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	3	Amnon had an adviser named Jonadab . He was the son of David ’ s brother Shimeah . Jonadab was a very clever man .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	4	He asked Amnon , “ You are the king ’ s son , aren ’ t you ? So why do you look so worn out every morning ? Won ’ t you tell me ? ” Amnon answered , “ I ’ m in love with Tamar . She ’ s the sister of my brother Absalom. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	5	“ Go to bed , ” Jonadab said . “ Pretend to be sick . Your father will come to see you . When he does , tell him , ‘ I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat . Let her prepare the food right here in front of me where I can watch her . Then she can feed it to me. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	6	So Amnon went to bed . He pretended to be sick . The king came to see him . Amnon said to him , “ I would like my sister Tamar to come here . I want to watch her make some special bread . Then she can feed it to me. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	7	David sent a message to Tamar at the palace . He said , “ Go to your brother Amnon ’ s house . Prepare some food for him. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	8	So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon . He was lying in bed . She got some dough and mixed it . She shaped the bread right there in front of him . And she baked it .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	9	Then she took the bread out of the pan and served it to him . But he refused to eat it . “ Send everyone out of here , ” Amnon said . So everyone left him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	10	Then he said to Tamar , “ Bring the food here into my bedroom . Please feed it to me. ” So Tamar picked up the bread she had prepared . She brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	11	She took it to him so he could eat it . But he grabbed her . He said , “ My sister , come to bed with me. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	12	“ No , my brother ! ” she said to him . “ Don ’ t force me ! An evil thing like that should never be done in Israel ! Don ’ t do it !
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	14	But Amnon refused to listen to her . He was stronger than she was . So he raped her .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	15	Then Amnon hated Tamar very much . In fact , he hated her more than he had loved her before . He said to her , “ Get up ! Get out ! ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	16	“ No ! ” she said to him . “ Don ’ t send me away . That would be worse than what you have already done to me. ” But he refused to listen to her .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	17	He sent for his personal servant . He said , “ Get this woman out of my sight . Lock the door behind her. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	18	So his servant threw her out . Then he locked the door behind her . Tamar was wearing a beautiful robe . It was the kind of robe the virgin daughters of the king wore .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	19	She put ashes on her head . She tore the beautiful robe she was wearing . She put her hands on her head and went away . She was weeping out loud as she went .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	20	When her brother Absalom saw her , he spoke to her . He said , “ Has Amnon , that brother of yours , forced you to go to bed with him ? My sister , don ’ t let it upset you . Don ’ t let it bother you . He ’ s your brother. ” After that , Tamar lived in her brother Absalom ’ s house . She was very lonely .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	21	King David heard about everything that had happened . So he became very angry .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	22	And Absalom never said a word of any kind to Amnon . He hated Amnon because he had brought shame on his sister Tamar . Absalom Kills Amnon
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	23	Two years later , Absalom invited all the king ’ s sons to come to Baal Hazor . It was near the border of Ephraim . The workers who clipped the wool off Absalom ’ s sheep were there .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	24	Absalom went to the king . He said , “ I ’ ve had my workers come to clip the wool . Will you and your attendants please join me ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	25	“ No , my son , ” the king replied . “ All of us shouldn ’ t go . It would be too much trouble for you. ” Although Absalom begged him , the king still refused to go . But he gave Absalom his blessing .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	26	Then Absalom said , “ If you won ’ t come , please let my brother Amnon come with us. ” The king asked him , “ Why should he go with you ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	27	But Absalom begged him . So the king sent Amnon with him . He also sent the rest of his sons .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	28	Absalom ordered his men , “ Listen ! When Amnon has had too much wine to drink , I ’ ll say to you , ‘ Strike Amnon down. ’ When I do , kill him . Don ’ t be afraid . I ’ ve given you an order , haven ’ t I ? Be strong and brave. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	29	So Absalom ’ s men killed Amnon , just as Absalom had ordered . Then all the king ’ s sons got on their mules and rode away .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	30	While they were on their way , a report came to David . It said , “ Absalom has struck down all your sons . Not one of them is left alive. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	31	The king stood up and tore his clothes . Then he lay down on the ground . All his attendants stood near him . They had also torn their clothes .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	32	Jonadab , the son of David ’ s brother Shimeah , spoke up . He said , “ You shouldn ’ t think that all the princes have been killed . The only one who is dead is Amnon . Absalom had planned to kill him ever since the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	33	You are my king and master . You shouldn ’ t be concerned about this report . It ’ s not true that all your sons are dead . The only one who is dead is Amnon. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	34	While all of that was taking place , Absalom ran away . The man on guard duty at Jerusalem looked up . He saw many people coming on the road west of him . They were coming down the side of the hill . He went and spoke to the king . He said , “ I see men coming down the road from Horonaim . They are coming down the side of the hill. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	35	Jonadab said to the king , “ See , your sons are coming . It has happened just as I said it would. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	36	As he finished speaking , the king ’ s sons came in . They were weeping out loud . The king and all his attendants were also weeping very bitterly .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	37	When Absalom ran away , he went to Talmai , the son of Ammihud . Talmai was king of Geshur . King David mourned many days for his son Amnon .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	38	So Absalom ran away and went to Geshur . He stayed there for three years .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	13	39	After some time the king got over his sorrow because of Amnon ’ s death . Then King David longed to go to Absalom . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	2	So Joab sent someone to Tekoa to have a wise woman brought back from there . Joab said to her , “ Pretend you are filled with sadness . Put on the rough clothing people wear when they ’ re sad . Don ’ t use any makeup . Act like a woman who has spent many days mourning for someone who has died .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	14	All of us must die . We are like water spilled on the ground . It can ’ t be put back into the jar . But that is not what God desires . Instead , he finds a way to bring back anyone who was driven away from him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	3	Then go to the king . Give him the message I ’ m about to give you. ” And Joab told her what to say .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	4	The woman from Tekoa went to the king . She bowed down with her face toward the ground . She did it to show him respect . She said , “ Your Majesty , please help me ! ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	5	The king asked her , “ What ’ s bothering you ? ” She said , “ I ’ m a widow . My husband is dead .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	6	I had two sons . They got into a fight with each other in a field . No one was there to separate them . One of my sons struck down the other one and killed him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	7	Now my whole family group has risen up against me . They say , ‘ Hand over the one who struck down his brother . Then we can put him to death for killing his brother . That will also get rid of the one who will receive the family property. ’ They want to kill the only living son I have left , just as someone would put out a burning coal . That would leave my husband without any son on the face of the earth to carry on the family name. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	8	The king said to the woman , “ Go home . I ’ ll give an order to make sure you are taken care of. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	9	But the woman from Tekoa said to him , “ You are my king and master . Please pardon me and my family . You and your royal family won ’ t be guilty of doing anything wrong. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	10	The king replied , “ If people give you any trouble , bring them to me . They won ’ t bother you again. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	11	She said , “ Please pray to the Lord your God . Pray that he will keep our nearest male relative from killing my other son . Then my son won ’ t be destroyed. ” “ You can be sure that the Lord lives , ” the king said . “ And you can be just as sure that not one hair of your son ’ s head will fall to the ground. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	12	Then the woman said , “ King David , please let me say something else to you. ” “ Go ahead , ” he replied .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	13	The woman said , “ You are the king . So why have you done something that brings so much harm on God ’ s people ? When you do that , you hand down a sentence against yourself . You won ’ t let the son you drove away come back .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	15	“ King David , I ’ ve come here to say this to you now . I ’ ve done it because people have made me afraid . I thought , ‘ I ’ ll go and speak to the king . Perhaps he ’ ll do what I ’ m asking .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	16	A man is trying to separate me and my son from the property God gave us . Perhaps the king will agree to save me from that man. ’
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	17	“ So now I ’ m saying , ‘ May what you have told me prevent that man from doing what he wants . You are like an angel of God . You know what is good and what is evil . May the Lord your God be with you. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	18	Then the king said to the woman , “ I ’ m going to ask you a question . I want you to tell me the truth. ” “ Please ask me anything you want to , ” the woman said .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	19	The king asked , “ Joab told you to say all of this , didn ’ t he ? ” The woman answered , “ What you have told me is exactly right . And that ’ s just as sure as you are alive . It ’ s true that Joab directed me to do this . He told me everything he wanted me to say .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	20	He did it to change the way things now are . You are as wise as an angel of God . You know everything that happens in the land. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	21	Later the king said to Joab , “ All right . I ’ ll do what you want . Go . Bring back the young man Absalom. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	22	Joab bowed down with his face toward the ground . He did it to honor the king . And he asked God to bless the king . He said , “ You are my king and master . Today I know that you are pleased with me . You have given me what I asked for. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	23	Then Joab went to Geshur . He brought Absalom back to Jerusalem .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	24	But the king said , “ He must go to his own house . I don ’ t want him to come and see me. ” So Absalom went to his own house . He didn ’ t go to see the king .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	25	In the whole land of Israel there wasn ’ t any man as handsome as Absalom was . That ’ s why everyone praised him . From the top of his head to the bottom of his feet he didn ’ t have any flaws .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	26	He used to cut his hair once a year when it became too heavy for him . Then he would weigh it . It weighed five pounds in keeping with the standard weights used in the palace .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	27	Three sons and a daughter were born to Absalom . His daughter ’ s name was Tamar . She became a beautiful woman .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	28	Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years without going to see the king .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	29	Then Absalom sent for Joab . He wanted to send Joab to the king . But Joab refused to come to Absalom . So Absalom sent for him a second time . But Joab still refused to come .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	30	Then Absalom said to his servants , “ Joab ’ s field is next to mine . He has barley growing there . Go and set it on fire. ” So Absalom ’ s servants set the field on fire .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	31	Joab finally went to Absalom ’ s house . He said to Absalom , “ Why did your servants set my field on fire ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	32	Absalom said to Joab , “ I sent a message to you . I said , ‘ Come here . I want to send you to the king . I want you to ask him for me , “ Why did you bring me back from Geshur ? I would be better off if I were still there ! ” ’ Now then , I want to go and see the king . If I ’ m guilty of doing anything wrong , let him put me to death. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	14	33	So Joab went to the king and told him that . Then the king sent for Absalom . He came in and bowed down to the king with his face toward the ground . And the king kissed Absalom . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	2	He would get up early . He would stand by the side of the road that led to the city gate . Sometimes a person would come with a case for the king to decide . Then Absalom would call out to him , “ What town are you from ? ” He would answer , “ I ’ m from one of the tribes of Israel. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	15	The king ’ s officials answered him , “ You are our king and master . We ’ re ready to do anything you want. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	50	men to run in front of him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	3	Absalom would say , “ Look , your claims are based on the law . So you have every right to make them . But the king doesn ’ t have anyone here who can listen to your case. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	4	Absalom would continue , “ I wish I were appointed judge in the land ! Then anyone who has a case or a claim could come to me . I would make sure they are treated fairly. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	5	Sometimes people would approach Absalom and bow down to him . Then he would reach out his hand . He would take hold of them and kiss them .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	6	Absalom did that to all the Israelites who came to the king with their cases or claims . That ’ s why the hearts of the people were turned toward him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	7	After Absalom had lived in Jerusalem for four years , he went and spoke to the king . He said , “ Let me go to Hebron . I want to keep a promise I made to the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	8	When I was living at Geshur in Aram , I made a promise . I said , ‘ If the Lord takes me back to Jerusalem , I ’ ll go to Hebron and worship him there. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	9	The king said to him , “ Go in peace. ” So he went to Hebron .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	10	Then Absalom sent messengers secretly to all the tribes of Israel . They said , “ Listen for the sound of trumpets . As soon as you hear them , say , ‘ Absalom has become king in Hebron. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	11	Absalom had taken
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	200	men from Jerusalem with him to Hebron . He had invited them to be his guests . They went without having any idea what was going to happen .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	12	While Absalom was offering sacrifices , he sent for Ahithophel . Ahithophel was David ’ s adviser . He came to Absalom from Giloh , his hometown . The number of people who followed Absalom kept growing . So he became more and more able to carry out his plans against David . David Runs Away From Absalom
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	13	A messenger came and spoke to David . He told him , “ The hearts of the Israelites are turned toward Absalom. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	14	Then David spoke to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem . He said , “ Come on ! We have to leave right away ! If we don ’ t , none of us will escape from Absalom . He ’ ll move quickly to catch up with us . He ’ ll destroy us . His men will kill everyone in the city with their swords. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	16	The king started out . Everyone in his whole family went with him . But he left ten concubines behind to take care of the palace .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	17	So the king and all those with him left . They stopped at the edge of the city .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	18	All of David ’ s officials marched past him . All the Kerethites and Pelethites marched along with them . And all of the
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	600	men who had come with him from Gath marched in front of him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	19	The king spoke to Ittai . He was from Gath . The king said to him , “ Why do you want to come along with us ? Go back . Stay with King Absalom . You are an outsider . You left your own country .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	20	You came to join me only a short time ago . So why should I make you wander around with us now ? I don ’ t even know where I ’ m going . So go on back . Take your people with you . And may the Lord be kind and faithful to you. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	21	But Ittai replied to the king , “ You are my king and master . I want to be where you are . It doesn ’ t matter whether I live or die . And that ’ s just as sure as the Lord and you are alive. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	22	David said to Ittai , “ Go ahead then . Keep marching with my men. ” So Ittai , the Gittite , kept marching . All his men and their families marched with him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	23	All the people in the countryside wept out loud as David and all his followers passed by . The king went across the Kidron Valley . He and all the people with him moved on toward the desert .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	24	Zadok also went with them . Some of the Levites went with him . They were carrying the ark of the covenant of God . They set down the ark . Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had left the city .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	25	Then the king said to Zadok , “ Take the ark of God back into the city . If the Lord is pleased with me , he ’ ll bring me back . He ’ ll let me see the ark again . He ’ ll also let me see Jerusalem again . That ’ s the place where he lives .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	26	But suppose he says , ‘ I am not pleased with you. ’ Then I accept that . Let him do to me what he thinks is best. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	27	The king said again to Zadok the priest , “ Do you understand ? Go back to the city with my blessing . Take your son Ahimaaz with you . Also take Abiathar and his son Jonathan with you .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	28	I ’ ll wait at the place in the desert where we can go across the Jordan River . I ’ ll wait there until you send word to let me know what ’ s happening. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	29	So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem . They stayed there .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	30	But David went on up the Mount of Olives . He was weeping as he went . His head was covered , and he was barefoot . All the people with him covered their heads too . And they were weeping as they went up .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	31	David had been told , “ Ahithophel , along with Absalom , is one of the people making secret plans against you. ” So David prayed , “ Lord , make Ahithophel ’ s advice look foolish. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	32	David arrived at the top of the Mount of Olives . That ’ s where people used to worship God . Hushai , the Arkite , was there to meet him . His robe was torn . There was dust on his head .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	33	David said to him , “ If you go with me , you will be too much trouble for me .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	34	So return to the city . Say to Absalom , ‘ Your Majesty , I ’ ll be your servant . In the past , I was your father ’ s servant . But now I ’ ll be your servant. ’ If you do that , you can help me by making sure Ahithophel ’ s advice fails .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	35	Zadok and Abiathar , the priests , will be there with you . Tell them everything you hear in the king ’ s palace .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	15	36	They have their sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan there with them . Send them to tell me everything you hear. ”

NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	2	The king asked Ziba , “ Why have you brought all these things ? ” Ziba answered , “ The donkeys are for the king ’ s family to ride on . The bread and fruit are for the people to eat . The wine will make those who get tired in the desert feel like new again. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	16	Then Hushai , the Arkite , went to Absalom . He said to him , “ May the king live a long time ! May the king live a long time ! ” Hushai was David ’ s trusted friend .

NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	100	fig cakes and a bottle of wine . The bottle was made out of animal skin .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	3	Then the king asked , “ Where is your master ’ s grandson Mephibosheth ? ” Ziba said to him , “ He ’ s staying in Jerusalem . He thinks , ‘ Today the Israelites will cause me to rule once again over my grandfather Saul ’ s kingdom. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	4	Then the king said to Ziba , “ Everything that belonged to Mephibosheth belongs to you now. ” “ You are my king and master , ” Ziba said . “ I make myself humble in front of you . I bow down to you . May you be pleased with me. ” Shimei Curses David
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	5	King David approached Bahurim . As he did , a man came out toward him . The man was from the same family group that Saul was from . His name was Shimei . He was the son of Gera . As he came out of the town , he cursed David .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	6	He threw stones at David and all his officials . He did it even though all the troops and the special guard were there . They were to the right and left of David .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	7	As Shimei cursed , he said , “ Get out ! Get out , you murderer ! You are a worthless and evil man !
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	8	You spilled the blood of a lot of people in Saul ’ s family . You took over his kingdom . Now the Lord is paying you back . He has handed the kingdom over to your son Absalom . You have been destroyed because you are a murderer ! ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	9	Then Abishai , the son of Zeruiah , spoke to the king . He said , “ King David , why should we let this dead dog curse you ? Let me go over there . I ’ ll cut off his head. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	10	But the king said , “ You and Joab are sons of Zeruiah . What does this have to do with you ? Maybe the Lord said to him , ‘ Curse David. ’ If he did , who can ask him , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	11	Then David spoke to Abishai and all his officials . He said , “ My very own son Absalom is trying to kill me . How much more should this man from Benjamin want to kill me ! Leave him alone . Let him curse . The Lord has told him to do it .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	12	Maybe the Lord will see how much I ’ m suffering . Maybe he ’ ll bring back to me his covenant blessing instead of his curse I ’ m hearing today. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	13	So David and his men kept going along the road . At the same time , Shimei was going along the hillside across from him . He was cursing David as he went . He was throwing stones at David . He was showering him with dirt .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	14	The king and all the people with him came to the place they had planned to go to . They were very tired . So David rested there . Ahithophel and Hushai Give Advice to Absalom
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	15	During that time , Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem . Ahithophel was with him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	17	Absalom said to Hushai , “ So this is the way you show love to your friend ? If he ’ s your friend , why didn ’ t you go with him ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	18	Hushai said to Absalom , “ Why should I ? You are the one the Lord has chosen . These people and all the men of Israel have also chosen you . I want to be on your side . I want to stay with you .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	19	After all , who else should I serve ? Shouldn ’ t I serve the king ’ s son ? I will serve you , just as I served your father. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	20	Absalom said to Ahithophel , “ Give us your advice . What should we do ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	21	Ahithophel answered , “ Your father left some concubines behind to take care of the palace . Go and sleep with them . Then all the Israelites will hear about it . They will hear that you have made your father hate you . Everyone with you will be encouraged to give you more support. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	22	So they set up a tent for Absalom on the roof of the palace . He went in and slept with his father ’ s concubines . Everyone in Israel saw it .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	16	23	In those days the advice Ahithophel gave was as good as advice from someone who asks God for guidance . That ’ s what David and Absalom thought about all of Ahithophel ’ s advice . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	2	Attack him while he ’ s tired and weak . Fill him with terror . Then all the people with him will run away . Don ’ t strike down anyone except the king .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	17	Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En Rogel just outside Jerusalem . They knew they would be in danger if anyone saw them entering the city . A female servant was supposed to go and tell them what had happened . Then they were supposed to go and tell King David .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	3	Bring all the other people back . After the man you want to kill is dead , everyone else will return to you . And none of the people will be harmed. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	4	Ahithophel ’ s plan seemed good to Absalom . It also seemed good to all the elders of Israel .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	5	But Absalom said , “ Send for Hushai , the Arkite . Then we can find out what he suggests as well. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	6	Hushai came to him . Absalom said , “ Ahithophel has given us his advice . Should we do what he says ? If we shouldn ’ t , tell us what you would do. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	7	Hushai replied to Absalom , “ The advice Ahithophel has given you isn ’ t good this time .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	8	You know your father and his men . They are fighters . They are as strong as a wild bear whose cubs have been stolen from her . Besides , your father really knows how to fight . He won ’ t spend the night with his troops .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	9	In fact , he ’ s probably hiding in a cave or some other place right now . Suppose he attacks your troops first . When people hear about it , they ’ ll say , ‘ Many of the troops who followed Absalom have been killed. ’
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	10	Then the hearts of your soldiers will melt away in fear . Even those as brave as a lion will be terrified . That ’ s because everyone in Israel knows that your father is a fighter . They know that those with him are brave .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	11	“ So here ’ s what I suggest . Bring together all the men of Israel from the town of Dan all the way to Beersheba . They are as many as the grains of sand on the seashore . You yourself should lead them into battle .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	12	Then we ’ ll attack David no matter where we find him . As dew completely covers the ground , we ’ ll completely overpower his entire army . We won ’ t leave him or any of his men alive .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	13	He might try to get away by going into a city . If he does , all of us will bring ropes to that city . We ’ ll drag the whole city down into the valley . Not even a pebble of that city will be left. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	14	Absalom and all the men of Israel agreed . They said , “ The advice of Hushai , the Arkite , is better than the advice of Ahithophel. ” The Lord had decided that Ahithophel ’ s good advice would fail . The Lord wanted to bring horrible trouble on Absalom .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	15	Hushai spoke to Zadok and Abiathar , the priests . He said , “ Ahithophel has given advice to Absalom and the elders of Israel . He suggested that they should do one thing . But I suggested something else .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	16	Send a message right away . Tell David , ‘ Don ’ t spend the night in the desert at a place where people cross the Jordan River . Make sure you go on across . If you don ’ t , you and all the people with you will be swallowed up. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	18	But a young man saw Jonathan and Ahimaaz and told Absalom about it . So the two men left right away . They went to the house of a man in Bahurim . He had a well in his courtyard . They climbed down into it .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	19	The man ’ s wife got a covering and spread it out over the opening of the well . Then she scattered grain on the covering . So no one knew that the men were hiding in the well .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	20	Absalom ’ s men came to the house . They asked the woman , “ Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan ? ” She answered , “ They went across the brook. ” When the men looked around , they didn ’ t find anyone . So they returned to Jerusalem .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	21	After they had gone , Jonathan and Ahimaaz climbed out of the well . They went to tell King David what they had found out . They said to him , “ Go across the river right away . Ahithophel has told Absalom how to come after you and strike you down. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	22	So David and all the people with him started out . They went across the Jordan River . By sunrise , everyone had crossed over .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	23	Ahithophel saw that his advice wasn ’ t being followed . So he put a saddle on his donkey . He started out for his house in his hometown . When he arrived , he made everything ready for his death . He made out his will . Then he killed himself . And so he died and was buried in his father ’ s tomb . Absalom Dies
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	24	David went to Mahanaim . Absalom went across the Jordan River with all the men of Israel .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	25	Absalom had made Amasa commander of the army in place of Joab . Amasa was the son of Jether . Jether belonged to the family line of Ishmael . He had married Abigail . She was the daughter of Nahash and the sister of Zeruiah . Zeruiah was the mother of Joab .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	26	Absalom and the Israelites camped in the land of Gilead .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	27	David came to Mahanaim . Shobi , the son of Nahash , met him there . Shobi was from Rabbah in the land of Ammon . Makir , the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar , met him there too . So did Barzillai from Rogelim in the land of Gilead .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	28	They brought beds , bowls and clay pots . They brought wheat , barley , flour , and grain that had been cooked . They brought beans and lentils .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	17	29	They brought honey , butter , sheep , and cheese that was made from cows ’ milk . They brought all that food for David and his people to eat . They said , “ These people have become tired . They ’ ve become hungry and thirsty in the desert. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	2	Then David sent out his troops in military groups . One group was under the command of Joab . Another was under Joab ’ s brother Abishai , the son of Zeruiah . The last was under Ittai , the Gittite . The king told the troops , “ You can be sure that I myself will march out with you. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	18	Earlier in his life Absalom had set up a pillar in the King ’ s Valley . He had put it up as a monument to himself . He thought , “ I don ’ t have a son to carry on the memory of my name. ” So he named the pillar after himself . It is still called Absalom ’ s Monument to this day . David Mourns Over Absalom
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	3	But the men said , “ You must not march out . If we are forced to run away , our enemies won ’ t care about us . Even if half of us die , they won ’ t care . But you are worth 10,000 of us . So it would be better for you to stay here in the city . Then you can send us help if we need it. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	4	The king said , “ I ’ ll do what you think is best. ” So the king stood beside the city gate . His whole army marched out in groups of hundreds and groups of thousands .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	5	The king gave an order to Joab , Abishai and Ittai . He commanded them , “ Be gentle with the young man Absalom . Do it for me. ” All the troops heard the king give the commanders that order about Absalom .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	6	David ’ s army marched out of the city to fight against Israel . The battle took place in the forest of Ephraim .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	7	There David ’ s men won the battle over Israel ’ s army . A huge number of men were wounded or killed that day . The total number was 20,000 .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	8	The fighting spread out over the whole countryside . But more men were killed in the forest that day than out in the open .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	9	Absalom happened to come across some of David ’ s men . He was riding his mule . The mule went under the thick branches of a large oak tree . Absalom ’ s hair got caught in the tree . He was left hanging in the air . The mule he was riding kept on going .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	10	One of David ’ s men saw what had happened . He told Joab , “ I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	11	Joab said to the man , “ What ! You saw him ? Why didn ’ t you strike him down right there ? Then I would have had to give you four ounces of silver and a soldier ’ s belt. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	12	But the man replied , “ I wouldn ’ t do anything to hurt the king ’ s son . I wouldn ’ t do it even for
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	25	The guard called out to the king and reported it . The king said , “ If the runner is alone , he must be bringing good news. ” The runner came closer and closer .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	13	Suppose I had put my life in danger by killing him . The king would have found out about it . Nothing is hidden from him . And you wouldn ’ t have stood up for me. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	14	Joab said , “ I ’ m not going to waste any more time on you. ” So he got three javelins . Then he went over and plunged them into Absalom ’ s heart . He did it while Absalom was still hanging there alive in the oak tree .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	15	Ten of the men carrying Joab ’ s armor surrounded Absalom . They struck him and killed him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	16	Then Joab blew his trumpet . He ordered his troops to stop chasing Israel ’ s army .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	17	Joab ’ s men threw Absalom into a big pit in the forest . They covered him with a large pile of rocks . While all of that was going on , all the Israelites ran back to their homes .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	19	Ahimaaz , the son of Zadok , said to Joab , “ Let me run and take the news to the king . Let me tell him that the Lord has shown that David is in the right . The Lord has done this by saving David from his enemies. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	20	“ I don ’ t want you to take the news to the king today , ” Joab told him . “ You can do it some other time . But you must not do it today , because the king ’ s son is dead. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	21	Then Joab said to a man from Cush , “ Go . Tell the king what you have seen. ” The man bowed down in front of Joab . Then he ran off .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	22	Ahimaaz , the son of Zadok , spoke again to Joab . He said , “ I don ’ t care what happens to me . Please let me run behind the man from Cush. ” But Joab replied , “ My son , why do you want to go ? You don ’ t have any news that will bring you a reward. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	23	He said , “ I don ’ t care what happens . I want to run. ” So Joab said , “ Run ! ” Then Ahimaaz ran across the plain of the Jordan River . As he ran , he passed the man from Cush .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	24	David was sitting in the area between the inner and outer gates of the city . The man on guard duty went up to the roof over the entrance of the gate by the wall . As he looked out , he saw someone running alone .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	26	Then the man on guard duty saw another runner . He called out to the man guarding the gate . He said , “ Look ! There ’ s another man running alone ! ” The king said , “ He must be bringing good news too. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	27	The man on guard duty said , “ I can see that the first one runs like Ahimaaz , the son of Zadok. ” “ He ’ s a good man , ” the king said . “ He ’ s bringing good news. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	28	Then Ahimaaz called out to the king , “ Everything ’ s all right ! ” He bowed down in front of the king with his face toward the ground . He said , “ You are my king and master . Give praise to the Lord your God ! He has handed over to you those who lifted their hands to kill you. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	29	The king asked , “ Is the young man Absalom safe ? ” Ahimaaz answered , “ I saw total disorder . I saw it just as Joab was about to send the king ’ s servant and me to you . But I don ’ t know what it was all about. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	30	The king said , “ Stand over there and wait. ” So he stepped over to one side and stood there .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	31	Then the man from Cush arrived . He said , “ You are my king and master . I ’ m bringing you some good news . The Lord has shown that you are in the right . He has done this by rescuing you today from all those trying to kill you. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	32	The king asked the man from Cush , “ Is the young man Absalom safe ? ” The man replied , “ King David , may your enemies be like that young man . May all those who rise up to harm you be like him. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	18	33	The king was very upset . He went up to the room over the entrance of the gate and wept . As he went , he said , “ My son Absalom ! My son , my son Absalom ! I wish I had died instead of you . Absalom ! My son , my son ! ” Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	2	The army had won a great battle that day . But their joy turned into sadness . That ’ s because someone had told the troops , “ The king is filled with sorrow because his son is dead. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	19	He said to him , “ You are my king and master . Please don ’ t hold me guilty . Please forgive me for the wrong things I did on the day you left Jerusalem . Please forget all about them .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	3	The men came quietly into the city that day . They were like fighting men who are ashamed because they ’ ve run away from a battle .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	4	The king covered his face . He cried loudly , “ My son Absalom ! Absalom , my son , my son ! ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	5	Then Joab went into the king ’ s house . He said to him , “ Today you have made all your men feel ashamed . They have just saved your life . They have saved the lives of your sons and daughters . And they have saved the lives of your wives and concubines .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	6	You love those who hate you . You hate those who love you . The commanders and their troops don ’ t mean anything to you . You made that very clear today . I can see that you would be pleased if Absalom were alive today and all of us were dead .

NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	8	So the king got up and took his seat in the entrance of the city gate . His men were told , “ The king is sitting in the entrance of the gate. ” Then all of them came and stood in front of him . While all of that was going on , the Israelites had run back to their homes . David Returns to Jerusalem
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	9	People from all the tribes of Israel began to argue among themselves . They were saying , “ The king saved us from the power of our enemies . He saved us from the power of the Philistines . But now he has left the country to escape from Absalom .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	10	We anointed Absalom to rule over us . But he has died in battle . So why aren ’ t any of you talking about bringing the king back ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	11	King David sent a message to Zadok and Abiathar , the priests . David said , “ Speak to the elders of Judah . Tell them I said , ‘ News has reached me where I ’ m staying . People all over Israel are talking about bringing me back to my palace . Why should you be the last to do something about it ?
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	12	tribes in the kingdom . So we have a stronger claim on David than you have . Why then are you acting as if you hate us ?

NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	15	sons and
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	16	Shimei , the son of Gera , was among them . Shimei was from Bahurim in the territory of Benjamin . He hurried down to welcome King David back .

NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	18	They went across at the place where people usually cross it . Then they brought the king ’ s family back over with them . They were ready to do anything he wanted them to do . Shimei , the son of Gera , had also gone across the Jordan . When he did , he fell down flat with his face toward the ground in front of the king .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	21	Then Abishai , the son of Zeruiah , said , “ Shouldn ’ t Shimei be put to death for what he did ? He cursed you . And you are the Lord ’ s anointed king. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	22	But David replied , “ You and Joab are sons of Zeruiah . What does this have to do with you ? What right do you have to interfere ? Should anyone be put to death in Israel today ? Don ’ t I know that today I am king over Israel again ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	23	So the king made a promise to Shimei . He said to him , “ You aren ’ t going to be put to death. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	24	Mephibosheth was Saul ’ s grandson . He had also gone down to welcome the king back . He had not taken care of his feet .

NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	25	He came from Jerusalem to welcome the king . The king asked him , “ Mephibosheth , why didn ’ t you go with me ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	26	He said , “ You are my king and master . I ’ m not able to walk . So I thought , ‘ I ’ ll have a saddle put on my donkey . I ’ ll ride on it . Then I can go with the king. ’ But my servant Ziba turned against me .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	27	He has told you lies about me . King David , you are like an angel of God . So do what you wish .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	28	You should have put all the members of my grandfather ’ s family to death , including me . Instead , you always provided what I needed . So what right do I have to make any more appeals to you ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	29	The king said to him , “ You don ’ t have to say anything else . I order you and Ziba to divide up Saul ’ s land between you. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	30	Mephibosheth said to the king , “ I ’ m happy that you have returned home safely . So just let Ziba have everything. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	31	Barzillai had also come down to go across the Jordan River with the king . He wanted to send the king on his way from there . Barzillai was from Rogelim in the land of Gilead .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	32	He was very old . He was
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	80	years old . I can hardly tell the difference between what is enjoyable and what isn ’ t . I can hardly taste what I eat and drink . I can ’ t even hear the voices of male and female singers anymore . So why should I add my problems to yours ?

NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	34	But Barzillai said to the king , “ I won ’ t live for many more years . So why should I go up to Jerusalem with you ?

NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	39	So all the people went across the Jordan River . Then the king crossed over . The king kissed Barzillai and said goodbye to him . And Barzillai went back home .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	40	After the king had gone across the river , he went to Gilgal . Kimham had gone across with him . All the troops of Judah and half of the troops of Israel had taken the king across .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	41	Soon all the men of Israel were coming to the king . They were saying to him , “ Why did the men of Judah take you away from us ? They are our relatives . What right did they have to bring you and your family across the Jordan River ? What right did they have to bring all your men over with you ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	42	All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel . They said , “ We did that because the king is our close relative . So why should you be angry about what happened ? Have we eaten any of the king ’ s food ? Have we taken anything for ourselves ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	19	43	Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah . They said , “ We have ten of the

NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	2	So all the men of Israel deserted David . They followed Sheba , the son of Bikri . But the men of Judah stayed with their king . They remained with him from the Jordan River all the way to Jerusalem .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	20	“ I would never do anything like that ! ” Joab said . “ I would never swallow up or destroy what belongs to the Lord !
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	3	David returned to his palace in Jerusalem . He had left ten concubines there to take care of the palace . He put them in a house and kept them under guard . He gave them what they needed . But he didn ’ t sleep with them . They were kept under guard until the day they died . They lived as if they were widows .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	4	The king said to Amasa , “ Send for the men of Judah . Tell them to come to me within three days . And be here yourself. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	5	So Amasa went to get the men of Judah . But he took longer than the time the king had set for him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	6	David said to Abishai , “ Sheba , the son of Bikri , will do more harm to us than Absalom ever did . Take my men and go after him . If you don ’ t , he ’ ll find cities that have high walls around them . He ’ ll go into one of them and escape from us. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	7	So Joab ’ s men marched out with the Kerethites and Pelethites . They went out with all the mighty soldiers . All of them were under Abishai ’ s command . They marched out from Jerusalem and went after Sheba , the son of Bikri .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	8	They arrived at the great rock in Gibeon . Amasa went there to welcome them . Joab was wearing his military clothes . Over them at his waist he had strapped on a belt that held a dagger . As he stepped forward , he secretly took the dagger out .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	9	Joab said to Amasa , “ How are you , my friend ? ” Then Joab reached out his right hand . He took hold of Amasa ’ s beard to kiss him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	10	Amasa didn ’ t notice the dagger in Joab ’ s left hand . Joab stuck it into his stomach . His insides spilled out on the ground . Joab didn ’ t have to stab him again . Amasa was already dead . Then Joab and his brother Abishai went after Sheba , the son of Bikri .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	11	One of Joab ’ s men stood beside Amasa ’ s body . He said to the other men , “ Are you pleased with Joab ? Are you on David ’ s side ? Then follow Joab ! ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	12	Amasa ’ s body lay covered with his blood in the middle of the road . The man saw that all the troops stopped there . He realized that everyone was stopping to look at Amasa ’ s body . So he dragged it from the road into a field . Then he threw some clothes on top of it .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	13	After that happened , everyone continued on with Joab . They went after Sheba , the son of Bikri .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	14	Sheba passed through all the territory of the tribes of Israel . He arrived at the city of Abel Beth Maakah . He had gone through the entire area of the Bikrites . They had gathered together and followed him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	15	Joab and all his troops came to Abel Beth Maakah . They surrounded it because Sheba was there . They built a ramp up to the city . It stood against the outer wall . They pounded the wall with huge logs to bring it down .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	16	While that was going on , a wise woman called out from the city . She shouted , “ Listen ! Listen ! Tell Joab to come here . I want to speak to him. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	17	So Joab went toward her . She asked , “ Are you Joab ? ” “ I am , ” he answered . She said , “ Listen to what I have to say. ” “ I ’ m listening , ” he said .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	18	She continued , “ Long ago people used to say , ‘ Get your answer at Abel. ’ And that would settle the matter .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	19	We are the most peaceful and faithful people in Israel . You are trying to destroy a city that is like a mother in Israel . Why do you want to swallow up what belongs to the Lord ? ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	21	That isn ’ t what I have in mind at all . There ’ s a man named Sheba , the son of Bikri , in your city . He ’ s from the hill country of Ephraim . He ’ s trying to kill King David . Hand that man over to me . Then I ’ ll pull my men back from your city. ” The woman said to Joab , “ We ’ ll throw his head down to you from the wall. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	20	22	Then the woman gave her wise advice to all the people in the city . They cut off the head of Sheba , the son of Bikri . They threw it down to Joab . So he blew his trumpet . Then his men pulled back from the city . Each of them returned to his home . And Joab went back to the king in Jerusalem . David ’ s Officials

NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	2	The people of Gibeon weren ’ t a part of Israel . Instead , they were some of the Amorites who were still left alive . The Israelites had promised to spare them . But Saul had tried to put an end to them . That ’ s because he wanted to make Israel and Judah strong . So now King David sent for the people of Gibeon and spoke to them .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	21	He made fun of Israel . So Jonathan killed him . Jonathan was the son of David ’ s brother Shimeah .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	3	He asked them , “ What would you like me to do for you ? How can I make up for the wrong things that were done to you ? I want you to be able to pray that the Lord will once again bless his land. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	4	The people of Gibeon answered him . They said , “ No amount of silver or gold can make up for what Saul and his family did to us . And we can ’ t put anyone in Israel to death. ” “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” David asked .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	5	They answered the king , “ Saul nearly destroyed us . He made plans to wipe us out . We don ’ t have anywhere to live in Israel .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	6	So let seven of the males in his family line be given to us . We ’ ll kill them . We ’ ll put their dead bodies out in the open in the sight of the Lord . We ’ ll do it at Gibeah of Saul . Saul was the Lord ’ s chosen king. ” So King David said , “ I ’ ll give seven males to you. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	7	The king spared Mephibosheth . He was the son of Jonathan and the grandson of Saul . David had made a promise in front of the Lord . He had promised to be kind to Jonathan and the family line of his father Saul .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	8	But the king chose Armoni and another Mephibosheth . They were the two sons of Aiah ’ s daughter Rizpah . Saul was their father . The king also chose the five sons of Saul ’ s daughter Merab . Adriel , the son of Barzillai , was their father . Adriel was from Meholah .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	9	King David handed them over to the people of Gibeon . They killed them . They put their dead bodies out in the open on a hill in the sight of the Lord . All seven of them died together . They were put to death during the first days of the harvest . It happened just when people were beginning to harvest the barley .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	10	Aiah ’ s daughter Rizpah took some rough cloth people wear when they ’ re sad . She spread it out for herself on a rock . She stayed there from the beginning of the harvest until it rained . The rain poured down from the sky on the dead bodies of the seven males . She didn ’ t let the birds touch them by day . She didn ’ t let the wild animals touch them at night .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	11	Someone told David what Rizpah had done . She was Aiah ’ s daughter and Saul ’ s concubine .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	12	David went and got the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan . He got them from the citizens of Jabesh Gilead . They had stolen their bodies from the main street in Beth Shan . That ’ s where the Philistines had hung their bodies up on the city wall . They had done it after they struck Saul down on Mount Gilboa .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	13	David brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from Jabesh Gilead . The bones of the seven males who had been killed and put out in the open were also gathered up .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	14	The bones of Saul and his son Jonathan were buried in the tomb of Saul ’ s father Kish . The tomb was at Zela in the territory of Benjamin . Everything the king commanded was done . After that , God answered prayer and blessed the land . Wars Against the Philistines
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	15	Once again there was a battle between the Philistines and Israel . David went down with his men to fight against the Philistines . He became very tired .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	16	Ishbi-Benob belonged to the family line of Rapha . The tip of his bronze spear weighed seven and a half pounds . He was also armed with a new sword . He said he would kill David .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	17	But Abishai , the son of Zeruiah , came to save David . He struck down the Philistine and killed him . Then David ’ s men made a promise . They said to David , “ We never want you to go out with us to battle again . You are the lamp of Israel ’ s kingdom . We want that lamp to keep on burning brightly. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	18	There was another battle against the Philistines . It took place at Gob . At that time Sibbekai killed Saph . Sibbekai was a Hushathite . Saph was from the family line of Rapha .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	19	In another battle against the Philistines at Gob , Elhanan killed Goliath ’ s brother . Elhanan was the son of Jair from Bethlehem . Goliath was from the city of Gath . His spear was as big as a weaver ’ s rod .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	20	There was still another battle . It took place at Gath . A huge man lived there . He had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot . So the total number of his toes and fingers was
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	24	. He was also from the family of Rapha .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	21	22	Those four Philistine men lived in Gath . They were from the family line of Rapha . David and his men killed them . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Samuel	22	11	He got on the cherubim and flew . The wings of the wind lifted him up .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	22	12	He covered himself with darkness . The dark rain clouds of the sky were like a tent around him .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	22	13	From the brightness all around him flashes of lightning blazed out .

NIRV	2%20Samuel	22	42	They cried out for help . But there was no one to save them . They called out to the Lord . But he didn ’ t answer them .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	22	43	I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth . I pounded them and walked on them like mud in the streets .

NIRV	2%20Samuel	23	8	Here are the names of David ’ s mighty warriors . Josheb-Basshebeth was chief of the three mighty warriors . He was a Tahkemonite . He used his spear against
NIRV	2%20Samuel	23	800	men . He killed all of them at one time .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	23	9	Next to him was Eleazar . He was one of the three mighty warriors . He was the son of Dodai , the Ahohite . Eleazar was with David at Pas Dammim . That ’ s where Israel ’ s army made fun of the Philistines who were gathered there for battle . Then the Israelites pulled back .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	23	10	But Eleazar stayed right where he was . He struck down the Philistines until his hand grew tired . But he still held on to his sword . The Lord helped him win a great battle that day . The troops returned to Eleazar . They came back to him only to take what they wanted from the dead bodies .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	23	11	Next to him was Shammah , the son of Agee . Shammah was a Hararite . The Philistines gathered together at a place where there was a field full of lentils . Israel ’ s troops ran away from the Philistines .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	23	12	But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field . He didn ’ t let the Philistines capture it . He struck them down . The Lord helped him win a great battle .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	23	13	David was at the cave of Adullam . During harvest time , three of the

NIRV	2%20Samuel	23	14	At that time David was in his usual place of safety . Some Philistine troops were stationed at Bethlehem .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	23	15	David longed for a drink of water . He said , “ I wish someone would get me water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	23	16	So the three mighty warriors fought their way past the Philistine guards . They got some water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem . They took the water back to David . But David refused to drink it . Instead , he poured it out as a drink offering to the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	23	17	“ Lord , I would never drink that water ! ” David said . “ It stands for the blood of these men . They put their lives in danger by going to Bethlehem to get it. ” So David wouldn ’ t drink it . Those were some of the brave things the three mighty warriors did .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	23	18	Abishai was chief over the three mighty warriors . He was the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah . He used his spear against
NIRV	2%20Samuel	23	300	men . He killed all of them . So he became as famous as the three mighty warriors were .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	23	19	In fact , he was even more honored than the three mighty warriors . He became their commander . But he wasn ’ t included among them .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	23	20	Benaiah was a great hero from Kabzeel . He was the son of Jehoiada . Benaiah did many brave things . He struck down two of Moab ’ s best warriors . He also went down into a pit on a snowy day . He killed a lion there .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	23	21	And he struck down a huge Egyptian . The Egyptian was holding a spear . Benaiah went out to fight against him with a club . He grabbed the spear out of the Egyptian ’ s hand . Then he killed him with it .

NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	2	So the king spoke to Joab and the army commanders with him . He said , “ Go all through the territories of the tribes of Israel . Go from the town of Dan all the way to Beersheba . Count the fighting men . Then I ’ ll know how many there are. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	24	But the king replied to Araunah , “ No . I want to pay you for it . I won ’ t sacrifice to the Lord my God burnt offerings that haven ’ t cost me anything. ” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen . He paid

NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	4	The king ’ s word had more authority than the word of Joab and the army commanders . That was true in spite of what Joab had said . So they left the king and went out to count the fighting men of Israel .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	5	They went across the Jordan River . They camped south of the town in the middle of the Arnon River valley near Aroer . Then they went through Gad and continued on to Jazer .

NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	7	Then they went toward the fort of Tyre . They went to all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites . Finally , they went on to Beersheba . It was in the Negev Desert of Judah .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	8	They finished going through the entire land . Then they came back to Jerusalem . They had been gone for nine months and
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	20	ounces of silver for them .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	9	Joab reported to the king how many fighting men he had counted . In Israel there were 800,000 men who were able to handle a sword . In Judah there were 500,000 .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	10	David felt sorry that he had counted the fighting men . So he said to the Lord , “ I committed a great sin when I counted Judah and Israel ’ s men . Lord , I beg you to take away my guilt . I ’ ve done a very foolish thing. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	11	Before David got up the next morning , a message from the Lord came to Gad the prophet . He was David ’ s seer . The message said ,
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	12	“ Go and tell David , ‘ The Lord says , “ I could punish you in three different ways . Choose one of them for me to use against you. ” ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	13	So Gad went to David . He said to him , “ Take your choice . Do you want three years when there won ’ t be enough food in your land ? Or do you want three months when you will run away from your enemies while they chase you ? Or do you want three days when there will be a plague in your land ? Think it over . Then take your pick . Tell me how to answer the one who sent me. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	14	David said to Gad , “ I ’ m suffering terribly . Let us fall into the hands of the Lord . His mercy is great . But don ’ t let me fall into human hands. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	15	So the Lord sent a plague on Israel . It lasted from that morning until he decided to end it . From Dan all the way to Beersheba 70,000 people died .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	16	The angel reached his hand out to destroy Jerusalem . But the Lord stopped sending the plague . So he spoke to the angel who was making the people suffer . He said , “ That is enough ! Do not kill any more people. ” The angel of the Lord was at Araunah ’ s threshing floor . Araunah was from the city of Jebus .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	17	David saw the angel who was striking down the people . David said to the Lord , “ I ’ m the one who has sinned . I ’ m the one who has done what is wrong . I ’ m like a shepherd for these people . These people are like sheep . What have they done ? Let your judgment be on me and my family. ” David Builds an Altar
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	18	On that day Gad went to David . Gad said to him , “ Go up to the threshing floor of Araunah , the Jebusite . Build an altar there to honor the Lord. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	19	So David went up and did it . He did what the Lord had commanded through Gad .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	21	Araunah said , “ King David , you are my master . Why have you come to see me ? ” “ To buy your threshing floor , ” David answered . “ I want to build an altar there to honor the Lord . When I do , the plague on the people will be stopped. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	22	Araunah said to David , “ Take anything you wish . Offer it up . Here are oxen for the burnt offering . Here are threshing sleds . And here are wooden collars from the necks of the oxen . Use all the wood to burn the offering .
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	23	Your Majesty , I ’ ll give all of it to you. ” Araunah continued , “ And may the Lord your God accept you. ”
NIRV	2%20Samuel	24	25	David built an altar there to honor the Lord . He sacrificed burnt offerings and friendship offerings . Then the Lord answered David ’ s prayer and blessed the land . The plague on Israel was stopped . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Kings	1	1	King David was now very old . He couldn ’ t keep warm even when blankets were spread over him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	2	So his attendants spoke to him . They said , “ You are our king and master . Please let us try to find a young virgin to serve you . She can take care of you . She can lie down beside you to keep you warm. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	3	So David ’ s attendants looked all over Israel for a beautiful young woman . They found Abishag . She was from the town of Shunem . They brought her to the king .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	4	The woman was very beautiful . She took care of the king and served him . But the king didn ’ t have sex with her .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	5	Adonijah was the son of David and his wife Haggith . He came forward and announced , “ I ’ m going to be the next king. ” So he got chariots and horses ready . He also got
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	50	Adonijah was afraid of what Solomon might do to him . So he went and grabbed the horns of the altar for burnt offerings . Those horns stuck out from its upper corners .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	6	His father had never tried to stop him from doing what he wanted to . His father had never asked him , “ Why are you acting the way you do ? ” Adonijah was also very handsome . Now that Absalom was dead , Adonijah was David ’ s oldest son .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	7	Adonijah talked things over with Joab , the son of Zeruiah . He also talked with Abiathar the priest . They agreed to help him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	8	But Zadok the priest and Benaiah , the son of Jehoiada , didn ’ t join Adonijah . Nathan the prophet didn ’ t join him . Shimei and Rei didn ’ t join him . And neither did David ’ s special guard .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	9	Adonijah sacrificed sheep , cattle and fat calves . He sacrificed them at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel . He invited all his brothers , the king ’ s sons , and all the royal officials of Judah .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	10	But he didn ’ t invite Benaiah or Nathan the prophet . He didn ’ t invite the special guard or his brother Solomon either .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	11	Nathan asked Solomon ’ s mother Bathsheba , “ Haven ’ t you heard ? Adonijah , the son of Haggith , has made himself king . And King David doesn ’ t know anything about it .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	12	So let me tell you what to do to save your life . It will also save the life of your son Solomon .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	13	Go in and see King David . Say to him , ‘ You are my king and master . You promised me , “ You can be sure that your son Solomon will be king after me . He will sit on my throne. ” If that ’ s really true , why has Adonijah become king ? ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	14	While you are still talking to the king , I ’ ll come in and support what you have said. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	15	So Bathsheba went to see the old king in his room . Abishag , the Shunammite , was taking care of him there .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	16	Bathsheba bowed low in front of the king . “ What do you want ? ” the king asked .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	17	She said to him , “ My master , you made a promise in the name of the Lord your God . You promised me , ‘ Your son Solomon will be king after me . He will sit on my throne. ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	18	But now Adonijah has made himself king . And you don ’ t even know about it .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	19	He has sacrificed large numbers of cattle , fat calves and sheep . He has invited all the king ’ s sons . He has also invited Abiathar the priest and Joab , the commander of the army . But he hasn ’ t invited your son Solomon .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	20	You are my king and master . All the Israelites are watching to see what you will do . They want to find out from you who will sit on the throne after you .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	21	If you don ’ t do something , I and my son Solomon will be treated like people who have committed crimes . That will happen as soon as you join the members of your family who have already died. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	22	While she was still speaking with the king , Nathan the prophet arrived .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	23	The king was told , “ Nathan the prophet is here. ” So Nathan went to the king . He bowed down with his face toward the ground .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	24	Nathan said , “ You are my king and master . Have you announced that Adonijah will be king after you ? Have you said he will sit on your throne ?
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	25	Today he has gone down outside the city . He has sacrificed large numbers of cattle , fat calves and sheep . He has invited all the king ’ s sons . He has also invited the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest . Even now they are eating and drinking with him . They are saying , ‘ May King Adonijah live a long time ! ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	26	But he didn ’ t invite me . He didn ’ t invite Zadok the priest or Benaiah , the son of Jehoiada . He didn ’ t invite your son Solomon either .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	27	King David , have you allowed all of that to happen ? Did you do it without letting us know about it ? Why didn ’ t you tell us who is going to sit on your throne after you ? ” David Makes Solomon King
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	28	King David said , “ Tell Bathsheba to come in. ” So she came and stood in front of the king .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	29	Then the king made a promise . He said , “ The Lord has saved me from all my troubles . You can be sure that he lives .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	30	And you can be just as sure I will do what I promised . This is the day I will do what I promised in the name of the Lord . He is the God of Israel . I promised you that your son Solomon would be king after me . He will sit on my throne in my place. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	31	Then Bathsheba bowed down in front of the king . Her face was toward the ground . She said , “ King David , you are my master . May you live forever ! ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	32	King David said , “ Tell Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet to come in . Also tell Benaiah , the son of Jehoiada , to come. ” So they came to the king .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	33	He said to them , “ Take my officials with you . Have my son Solomon get on my own mule . Take him down to the Gihon spring .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	34	Have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him as king over Israel there . Blow a trumpet . Shout , ‘ May King Solomon live a long time ! ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	35	Then come back up to the city with him . Have him sit on my throne . He will rule in my place . I ’ ve appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	36	Benaiah , the son of Jehoiada , answered the king . “ Amen ! ” he said . “ May the Lord your God make it come true .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	37	You are my king and master . The Lord has been with you . May he also be with Solomon . King David , may the Lord make Solomon ’ s kingdom even greater than yours ! ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	38	So Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet left the palace . Benaiah , the son of Jehoiada , went with them . So did the Kerethites and Pelethites . They had Solomon get on King David ’ s mule . And they brought him down to the Gihon spring .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	39	Zadok the priest had taken an animal horn from the sacred tent . The horn was filled with olive oil . He anointed Solomon with the oil . A trumpet was blown . All the people shouted , “ May King Solomon live a long time ! ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	40	Then they went up toward the city . Solomon was leading the way . The people were playing flutes . They were filled with great joy . The ground shook because of all the noise .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	41	Adonijah and all his guests heard it . They were just finishing their meal . Joab heard the sound of the trumpet . So he asked , “ What does all this noise in the city mean ? ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	42	While Joab was still speaking , Jonathan arrived . Jonathan was the son of Abiathar the priest . Adonijah said , “ Come in . I have respect for you . You must be bringing good news. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	43	“ No ! I ’ m not ! ” Jonathan answered . “ Our master King David has made Solomon king .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	44	David sent Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet along with Solomon . He also sent Benaiah , the son of Jehoiada , with him . He sent the Kerethites and Pelethites with him too . They put him on the king ’ s mule .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	45	They took him down to the Gihon spring . There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him as king . Now they ’ ve gone back up to the city . They were cheering all the way . The city is filled with the sound of it . That ’ s the noise you hear .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	46	And that ’ s not all . Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	47	The royal officials came to give their blessing to our master King David . They said , ‘ May your God make Solomon ’ s name more famous than yours ! May he make Solomon ’ s kingdom greater than yours ! ’ While King David was sitting on his bed , he bowed in worship .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	48	He said , ‘ I praise the Lord . He is the God of Israel . He has let me live to see my son sitting on my throne today as the next king. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	49	When all Adonijah ’ s guests heard that , they were terrified . So they got up and scattered .
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	51	Then Solomon was told , “ King Solomon , Adonijah is afraid of you . He ’ s holding onto the horns of the altar . He says , ‘ I want King Solomon to make a promise today . I want him to promise that he won ’ t kill me with his sword. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	52	Solomon replied , “ Let him show that he ’ s a man people can respect . Then not even one hair on his head will fall to the ground . But if I find out he ’ s done something evil , he will die. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	1	53	King Solomon got some men to bring Adonijah down from the altar . He came and bowed down to King Solomon . Solomon said , “ Go on home. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Kings	2	3	Do everything the Lord your God requires . Live the way he wants you to . Obey his orders and commands . Keep his laws and rules . Do everything written in the Law of Moses . Then you will have success in everything you do . You will succeed everywhere you go .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	4	The Lord will keep the promise he made to me . He said , ‘ Your sons must be careful about how they live . They must be faithful to me with all their heart and soul . Then you will always have a son from your family line to sit on the throne of Israel. ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	5	“ You yourself know what Joab , the son of Zeruiah , did to me . You know that he killed Abner , the son of Ner , and Amasa , the son of Jether . They were the two commanders of Israel ’ s armies . He killed them in a time of peace . It wasn ’ t a time of war . Joab spilled the blood of Abner and Amasa . With that blood he stained the belt around his waist . He also stained the sandals on his feet .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	6	You are wise . So I leave him in your hands . Just don ’ t let him live to become an old man . Don ’ t let him die peacefully .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	7	“ But be kind to the sons of Barzillai from Gilead . Provide what they need . They were faithful to me when I had to run away from your brother Absalom .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	8	“ Don ’ t forget that Shimei , the son of Gera , is still around . He ’ s from Bahurim in the territory of Benjamin . Shimei cursed me bitterly . He did it on the day I went to Mahanaim . Later , he came down to welcome me at the Jordan River . At that time I made a promise in the name of the Lord . I promised Shimei , ‘ I won ’ t put you to death with my sword. ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	9	But now I want you to think of him as guilty . You are wise . You will know what to do to him . Don ’ t let him live to become an old man . Put him to death. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	10	David joined the members of his family who had already died . He was buried in the City of David .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	11	He had ruled over Israel for
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	40	When Shimei heard that , he put a saddle on his donkey . Then he went to Achish at Gath to look for his slaves . Shimei found them and brought them back from Gath .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	33	May Joab and his children after him be held forever accountable for spilling the blood of Abner and Amasa . But may David and his children after him enjoy the Lord ’ s peace and rest forever . May the Lord also give his peace to David ’ s royal house and kingdom forever. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	12	So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David . His position as king was made secure . Solomon ’ s Kingdom Is Made Secure
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	13	Adonijah was the son of David ’ s wife Haggith . He went to Bathsheba . She was Solomon ’ s mother . She asked Adonijah , “ Have you come in peace ? ” He answered , “ Yes . I ’ ve come in peace. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	14	He continued , “ I want to ask you something. ” “ Go ahead , ” she replied .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	15	He said , “ As you know , the kingdom belonged to me . The whole nation of Israel thought of me as their king . But now things have changed . The kingdom belongs to my brother . The Lord has given it to him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	16	But I have a favor to ask of you . Don ’ t say no to me. ” “ Go ahead , ” she said .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	17	So he continued , “ Please ask King Solomon for a favor . He won ’ t say no to you . Ask him to give me Abishag from Shunem to be my wife. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	18	“ All right , ” Bathsheba replied . “ I ’ ll speak to the king for you. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	19	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon . She went to him to speak for Adonijah . The king stood up to greet her . He bowed down to her . Then he sat down on his throne . He had a throne brought for his mother . She sat down at his right side .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	20	“ I have one small favor to ask of you , ” she said . “ Don ’ t say no to me. ” The king replied , “ Mother , go ahead and ask . I won ’ t say no to you. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	21	She said , “ Let your brother Adonijah marry Abishag , the Shunammite. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	22	King Solomon answered his mother , “ Why are you asking me to give Abishag , the Shunammite , to Adonijah ? You might as well ask me to give him the whole kingdom ! After all , he ’ s my older brother . And he doesn ’ t want the kingdom only for himself . He also wants it for Abiathar the priest and for Joab , the son of Zeruiah. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	23	Then King Solomon made a promise in the name of the Lord . He said , “ Adonijah will pay with his life because of what he has asked for . If he doesn ’ t , may God punish me greatly .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	24	The Lord has made my position as king secure . I ’ m sitting on the throne of my father David . The Lord has built a royal house for me , just as he promised . You can be sure that the Lord lives . And you can be just as sure that Adonijah will be put to death today. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	25	So King Solomon gave the order to Benaiah , the son of Jehoiada . Benaiah struck down Adonijah , and he died .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	26	The king spoke to Abiathar the priest . He said , “ Go back to your fields in Anathoth . You should really be put to death . But I won ’ t have it done now . That ’ s because you carried the ark of the Lord and King . You did it for my father David . You shared all of his hard times. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	27	So Solomon wouldn ’ t let Abiathar serve as a priest of the Lord anymore . That ’ s how the message the Lord had spoken at Shiloh came true . He had spoken it about the family of Eli .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	28	News of what Solomon had done reached Joab . Joab had never made evil plans along with Absalom . But he had joined Adonijah . So he ran to the tent of the Lord . He grabbed the horns that stuck out from the upper corners of the altar for burnt offerings .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	29	King Solomon was told that Joab had run to the tent . He was also told that Joab was by the altar . Then Solomon gave the order to Benaiah , the son of Jehoiada . He told him , “ Go ! Strike him down ! ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	30	So Benaiah entered the tent of the Lord . He said to Joab , “ The king says , ‘ Come on out ! ’ ” But Joab answered , “ No . I ’ d rather die here. ” Benaiah told the king what Joab had said to him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	31	Then the king commanded Benaiah , “ Do what he says . Strike him down and bury him . Then I and my family line won ’ t be held accountable for the blood Joab spilled . He killed people who weren ’ t guilty of doing anything wrong .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	32	The Lord will pay him back for the blood he spilled . Joab attacked two men . He killed them with his sword . And my father David didn ’ t even know anything about it . Joab killed Abner , the son of Ner . Abner was the commander of Israel ’ s army . Joab also killed Amasa , the son of Jether . Amasa was the commander of Judah ’ s army . Abner and Amasa were better men than Joab is . They were more honest than he is .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	34	So Benaiah , the son of Jehoiada , went up to the Lord ’ s tent . There he struck down Joab . And he killed him . Joab was buried at his home out in the country .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	35	The king put Benaiah in charge of the army . Benaiah took Joab ’ s place . The king also put Zadok the priest in Abiathar ’ s place .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	36	Then the king sent for Shimei . He said to him , “ Build yourself a house in Jerusalem . Live there . Don ’ t go anywhere else .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	37	You must not leave the city and go across the Kidron Valley . If you do , you can be sure you will die . And it will be your own fault. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	38	Shimei replied to the king , “ You are my king and master . What you say is good . I ’ ll do it. ” Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	39	Three years after Solomon had talked with Shimei , two of Shimei ’ s slaves ran off . They went to Achish , the king of Gath . He was the son of Maakah . Shimei was told , “ Your slaves are in Gath. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	41	Solomon was told that Shimei had left Jerusalem . He was told he had gone to Gath and had returned .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	42	So the king sent for Shimei . He said to him , “ Didn ’ t I force you to make a promise in the name of the Lord ? Didn ’ t I warn you ? I said , ‘ You must not leave the city and go somewhere else . If you do , you can be sure you will die. ’ At that time you said to me , ‘ What you say is good . I ’ ll obey your command. ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	43	So why didn ’ t you keep your promise to the Lord ? Why didn ’ t you obey the command I gave you ? ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	44	The king continued , “ You know all the wrong things you did to my father David . In your heart you know them . Now the Lord will pay you back for what you did .
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	45	But I will be blessed . The Lord will make David ’ s kingdom secure forever. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	2	46	Then the king gave the order to Benaiah , the son of Jehoiada . Benaiah left the palace and struck down Shimei . And he died . So the kingdom was now made secure in Solomon ’ s hands . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Kings	3	3	Solomon showed his love for the Lord . He did it by obeying the laws his father David had taught him . But Solomon offered sacrifices at the high places . He also burned incense there .
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	2	But the people continued to offer sacrifices at the high places where they worshiped . That ’ s because a temple hadn ’ t been built yet where the Lord would put his Name .
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	4	King Solomon went to the city of Gibeon to offer sacrifices . That ’ s where the most important high place was . There he offered 1,000 burnt offerings on the altar .
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	5	The Lord appeared to Solomon at Gibeon . He spoke to him in a dream during the night . God said , “ Ask for anything you want me to give you. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	6	Solomon answered , “ You have been very kind to my father David , your servant . That ’ s because he was faithful to you . He did what was right . His heart was honest . And you have continued to be very kind to him . You have given him a son to sit on his throne this day .

NIRV	1%20Kings	3	9	So give me a heart that understands . Then I can rule over your people . I can tell the difference between what is right and what is wrong . Who can possibly rule over this great nation of yours ? ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	10	The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for that .
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	11	So God said to him , “ You have not asked to live for a long time . You have not asked to be wealthy . You have not even asked to have your enemies killed . Instead , you have asked for wisdom . You want to do what is right and fair when you judge people . Because that is what you have asked for ,

NIRV	1%20Kings	3	15	Solomon woke up . He realized he had been dreaming . He returned to Jerusalem . He stood in front of the ark of the Lord ’ s covenant . He sacrificed burnt offerings and friendship offerings . Then he gave a feast for all his officials . A Wise Ruling
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	16	Two prostitutes came to the king . They stood in front of him .

NIRV	1%20Kings	3	18	Three days after my child was born , this woman also had a baby . We were alone . There wasn ’ t anyone in the house but the two of us .
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	19	“ During the night this woman ’ s baby died . It happened because she was lying on top of him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	20	So she got up in the middle of the night . She took my son from my side while I was asleep . She put him by her breast . Then she put her dead son by my breast .
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	21	The next morning , I got up to nurse my son . But he was dead ! I looked at him closely in the morning light . And I saw that it wasn ’ t my baby. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	22	The other woman said , “ No ! The living baby is my son . The dead one belongs to you. ” But the first woman said , “ No ! The dead baby is yours . The living one belongs to me. ” So they argued in front of the king .
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	23	The king said , “ One of you says , ‘ My son is alive . Your son is dead. ’ The other one says , ‘ No ! Your son is dead . Mine is alive. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	24	He continued , “ Bring me a sword. ” So a sword was brought to him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	25	Then he gave an order . He said , “ Cut the living child in two . Give half to one woman and half to the other. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	26	The woman whose son was alive was filled with deep love for her son . She said to the king , “ My master , please give her the living baby ! Don ’ t kill him ! ” But the other woman said , “ Neither one of us will have him . Cut him in two ! ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	27	Then the king made his decision . He said , “ Give the living baby to the first woman . Don ’ t kill him . She ’ s his mother. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	3	28	All the Israelites heard about the decision the king had given . That gave them great respect for him . They saw that God had given him wisdom . They knew that Solomon would do what was right and fair when he judged people . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Kings	5	1	Kings
NIRV	1%20Kings	5	5	So I ’ m planning to build a temple . I want to build it for the Name of the Lord my God . That ’ s what he told my father David he wanted me to do . He said , ‘ I will put your son on the throne in your place . He will build a temple . I will put my Name there. ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	5	2	Then Solomon sent a message back to Hiram . Solomon said ,
NIRV	1%20Kings	5	3	“ As you know , my father David had to fight many battles . His enemies attacked him from every side . So he couldn ’ t build a temple where the Lord his God would put his Name . That wouldn ’ t be possible until the Lord had put his enemies under his control .
NIRV	1%20Kings	5	4	But now the Lord my God has given me peace and rest on every side . We don ’ t have any enemies . And we don ’ t have any other major problems either .
NIRV	1%20Kings	5	6	“ So give your men orders to cut down cedar trees in Lebanon for me . My men will work with yours . I ’ ll pay you for your men ’ s work . I ’ ll pay any amount you decide on . As you know , we don ’ t have anyone as skilled in cutting down trees as the men of Sidon are. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	5	7	When Hiram heard Solomon ’ s message , he was very pleased . He said , “ May the Lord be praised today . He has given David a wise son to rule over that great nation. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	5	8	So Hiram sent a message to Solomon . Hiram said , “ I have received the message you sent me . I ’ ll do everything you want me to . I ’ ll provide the cedar and juniper logs .
NIRV	1%20Kings	5	9	My men will bring them from Lebanon down to the Mediterranean Sea . I ’ ll make them into rafts . I ’ ll float them to the place you want me to . When the rafts arrive , I ’ ll separate the logs from each other . Then you can take them away . And here ’ s what I want in return . Provide food for all the people in my palace. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	5	10	So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the cedar and juniper logs he wanted .
NIRV	1%20Kings	5	11	Solomon gave Hiram 3,600 tons of wheat as food for the people in his palace . He also gave him 120,000 gallons of oil made from pressed olives . He did that for Hiram year after year .

NIRV	1%20Kings	6	6	On the first floor the side rooms were seven and a half feet wide . On the second floor they were nine feet wide . And on the third floor they were ten and a half feet wide . Solomon made the walls of the temple thinner as they went up floor by floor . The result was ledges along the walls . So the floor beams of the side rooms rested on the ledges . The beams didn ’ t go into the temple walls .
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	480	years after the Israelites came out of Egypt . It was in the fourth year of Solomon ’ s rule over Israel . He started in the second month . That was the month of Ziv .

NIRV	1%20Kings	6	10	He built side rooms all along the temple . Each room was seven and a half feet high . They were joined to the temple by cedar beams .

NIRV	1%20Kings	6	12	“ You are now building this temple . Follow my orders . Keep my rules . Obey all my commands . Then I will make the promise I gave your father David come true . I will do it through you .
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	13	I will live among my people Israel . I will not desert them. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	14	So Solomon built the temple and finished it .

NIRV	1%20Kings	6	17	The main hall in front of the room was
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	60	feet long .

NIRV	1%20Kings	6	22	So Solomon covered the inside of the whole temple with gold . He also covered the altar for burning incense with gold . It was right in front of the Most Holy Room .
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	23	For the Most Holy Room Solomon made a pair of cherubim . He made them out of olive wood . Each cherub was
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	24	One wing of the first cherub was seven and a half feet long . The other wing was also seven and a half feet long . So the wings measured
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	25	The second cherub ’ s wings also measured
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	26	Each cherub was
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	27	Solomon placed the cherubim inside the Most Holy Room in the temple . Their wings were spread out . The wing tip of one cherub touched one wall . The wing tip of the other touched the other wall . The tips of their wings touched each other in the middle of the room .
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	28	Solomon covered the cherubim with gold .
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	29	On the walls all around the temple he carved cherubim , palm trees and open flowers . He carved them on the walls of the Most Holy Room and the main hall .
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	31	For the entrance to the Most Holy Room he made two doors out of olive wood . Each door was one-fifth of the width of the Most Holy Room .
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	32	On the two olive wood doors he carved cherubim , palm trees and open flowers . He covered the cherubim and palm trees with hammered gold .
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	33	In the same way he made olive wood doorposts for the entrance to the main hall . Each doorpost was one-fourth of the width of the hall .
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	34	He also made two doors out of juniper wood . Each door had two parts . They turned in bases shaped like cups .
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	35	He carved cherubim , palm trees and open flowers on the doors . He covered the doors with gold . He hammered the gold evenly over the carvings .
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	36	He used blocks of stone to build a wall around the inside courtyard . The first three layers of the wall were made out of stone . The top layer was made out of beautiful cedar wood .
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	37	The foundation of the Lord ’ s temple was laid in Solomon ’ s fourth year . It was in the month of Ziv .
NIRV	1%20Kings	6	38	The temple was finished in his 11th year . It was in the month of Bul . That was the eighth month . Everything was finished just as the plans required . Solomon had spent seven years building the temple . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Kings	7	29	On the sides between the posts were lions , bulls and cherubim . They were also on all of the posts . Above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths made out of hammered metal .
NIRV	1%20Kings	7	30	Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles . Each stand had a bowl that rested on four supports . The stand had wreaths on each side .

NIRV	1%20Kings	7	37	That ’ s how he made the ten stands . All of them were made in the same molds . And they had the same size and shape .

NIRV	1%20Kings	7	240	gallons . The bowls measured six feet across . There was one bowl for each of the ten stands .

NIRV	1%20Kings	8	11	The priests couldn ’ t do their work because of it . That ’ s because the glory of the Lord filled his temple .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	12	Then Solomon said , “ Lord , you have said you would live in a dark cloud .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	13	As you can see , I ’ ve built a beautiful temple for you . You can live in it forever. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	14	days .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	15	Then he said , “ I praise the Lord . He is the God of Israel . With his own mouth he made a promise to my father David . With his own powerful hand he made it come true . He said ,
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	16	‘ I brought my people Israel out of Egypt . Ever since , I haven ’ t chosen a city in any tribe of Israel where a temple could be built for my Name . But I have chosen David to rule over my people Israel. ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	17	“ With all his heart my father David wanted to build a temple . He wanted to do it so the Lord could put his Name there . The Lord is the God of Israel .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	18	But the Lord spoke to my father David . He said , ‘ With all your heart you wanted to build a temple for my Name . It is good that you wanted to do that .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	19	But you will not build the temple . Instead , your son will build the temple for my Name . He is your own flesh and blood. ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	20	“ The Lord has kept the promise he made . I ’ ve become the next king after my father David . Now I ’ m sitting on the throne of Israel . That ’ s exactly what the Lord promised would happen . I ’ ve built the temple where the Lord will put his Name . He is the God of Israel .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	21	I ’ ve provided a place for the ark there . The tablets of the Lord ’ s covenant law are inside it . He made that covenant with our people of long ago . He made it when he brought them out of Egypt. ” Solomon Prays to Set the Temple Apart to the Lord
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	22	Then Solomon stood in front of the Lord ’ s altar . He stood in front of the whole community of Israel . He spread out his hands toward heaven .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	23	He said , “ Lord , you are the God of Israel . There is no God like you in heaven above or on earth below . You keep the covenant you made with us . You show us your love . You do that when we follow you with all our hearts .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	24	You have kept your promise to my father David . He was your servant . With your mouth you made a promise . With your powerful hand you have made it come true . And today we can see it .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	25	“ Lord , you are the God of Israel . Keep the promises you made to my father David . Do it for him . He was your servant . Here is what you said to him . ‘ A son from your family line will sit before me on the throne of Israel . This will always be true if your children after you are careful in everything they do . They must live in my sight faithfully the way you have lived. ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	26	God of Israel , let your promise to my father David come true .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	27	“ But will you really live on earth ? After all , the heavens can ’ t hold you . In fact , even the highest heavens can ’ t hold you . So this temple I ’ ve built certainly can ’ t hold you !
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	28	But please pay attention to my prayer . Lord my God , be ready to help me as I make my appeal to you . Listen to my cry for help . Hear the prayer I ’ m praying to you today .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	29	Let your eyes look toward this temple night and day . You said , ‘ I will put my Name there. ’ So please listen to the prayer I ’ m praying toward this place .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	30	Hear me when I ask you to help us . Listen to your people Israel when they pray toward this place . Listen to us from heaven . It ’ s the place where you live . When you hear us , forgive us .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	31	“ Suppose someone does something wrong to their neighbor . And the person who has done something wrong is required to give their word . They must tell the truth about what they have done . They must come and do it in front of your altar in this temple .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	32	When they do , listen to them from heaven . Take action . Judge between the person and their neighbor . Punish the guilty one . Do to that person what they have done to their neighbor . Deal with the one who isn ’ t guilty in a way that shows they are free from blame . That will prove they aren ’ t guilty .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	33	“ Suppose your people Israel have lost the battle against their enemies . And suppose they ’ ve sinned against you . But they turn back to you and praise your name . They pray to you in this temple . And they ask you to help them .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	34	Then listen to them from heaven . Forgive the sin of your people Israel . Bring them back to the land you gave to their people who lived long ago .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	35	“ Suppose your people have sinned against you . And because of that , the sky is closed up and there isn ’ t any rain . But your people pray toward this place . They praise you by admitting they ’ ve sinned . And they turn away from their sin because you have made them suffer .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	36	Then listen to them from heaven . Forgive the sin of your people Israel . Teach them the right way to live . Send rain on the land you gave them as their share .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	37	“ Suppose there isn ’ t enough food in the land . And a plague strikes the land . The hot winds completely dry up our crops . Or locusts or grasshoppers come and eat them up . Or an enemy surrounds one of our cities and gets ready to attack it . Or trouble or sickness comes .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	38	But suppose one of your people prays to you . They ask you to help them . They are aware of how much their own heart is suffering . And they spread out their hands toward this temple to pray .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	39	Then listen to them from heaven . It ’ s the place where you live . Forgive them . Take action . Deal with everyone in keeping with everything they do . You know their hearts . In fact , you are the only one who knows every human heart .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	40	Your people will have respect for you . They will respect you as long as they are in the land you gave our people long ago .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	41	“ Suppose there are outsiders who don ’ t belong to your people Israel . And they have come from a land far away . They ’ ve come because they ’ ve heard about your name .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	42	When they get here , they will find out even more about your great name . They ’ ll hear about how you reached out your mighty hand and powerful arm . So they ’ ll come and pray toward this temple .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	43	Then listen to them from heaven . It ’ s the place where you live . Do what those outsiders ask you to do . Then all the nations on earth will know you . They will have respect for you . They ’ ll respect you just as your own people Israel do . They ’ ll know that your Name is in this house I ’ ve built .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	44	“ Suppose your people go to war against their enemies . It doesn ’ t matter where you send them . And suppose they pray to you toward the city you have chosen . They pray toward the temple I ’ ve built for your Name .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	45	Then listen to them from heaven . Listen to their prayer for your help . Stand up for them .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	46	“ Suppose your people sin against you . After all , there isn ’ t anyone who doesn ’ t sin . And suppose you get angry with them . You hand them over to their enemies . They take them as prisoners to their own lands . It doesn ’ t matter whether those lands are near or far away .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	47	But suppose your people change their ways in the land where they are held as prisoners . They turn away from their sins . They beg you to help them in the land of those who won the battle over them . They say , ‘ We have sinned . We ’ ve done what is wrong . We ’ ve done what is evil. ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	48	And they turn back to you with all their heart and soul . Suppose it happens in the land of their enemies who took them away as prisoners . There they pray to you toward the land you gave their people long ago . They pray toward the city you have chosen . And they pray toward the temple I ’ ve built for your Name .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	49	Then listen to them from heaven . It ’ s the place where you live . Listen to their prayer . Listen to them when they ask you to help them . Stand up for them .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	50	Your people have sinned against you . Please forgive them . Forgive them for all the wrong things they ’ ve done against you . And make those who won the battle over them show mercy to them .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	51	After all , they are your people . They belong to you . You brought them out of Egypt . You brought them out of that furnace that melts iron down and makes it pure .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	52	“ Let your eyes be open to me when I ask you to help us . Let them be open to your people Israel when they ask you to help them . Pay attention to them every time they cry out to you .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	53	After all , you chose them out of all the nations in the world . You made them your very own people . You did it just as you had announced through your servant Moses . That ’ s when you brought out of Egypt our people of long ago . You are our Lord and King. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	54	Solomon finished praying . He finished asking the Lord to help his people . Then he got up from in front of the Lord ’ s altar . He had been down on his knees with his hands spread out toward heaven .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	55	He stood in front of the whole community of Israel . He blessed them with a loud voice . He said ,
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	56	“ I praise the Lord . He has given peace and rest to his people Israel . That ’ s exactly what he promised to do . He gave his people good promises through his servant Moses . Every single word of those promises has come true .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	57	May the Lord our God be with us , just as he was with our people who lived long ago . May he never leave us . May he never desert us .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	58	May he turn our hearts to him . Then we will live the way he wants us to . We ’ ll obey the commands , rules and directions he gave our people of long ago .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	59	I ’ ve prayed these words to the Lord our God . May he keep them close to him day and night . May he stand up for me . May he also stand up for his people Israel . May he give us what we need every day .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	60	Then all the nations on earth will know that the Lord is God . They ’ ll know that there isn ’ t any other god .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	61	And may you commit your lives completely to the Lord our God . May you live by his rules . May you obey his commands . May you always do as you are doing now. ” The Temple Is Set Apart to the Lord
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	62	Then the king and the whole community of Israel offered sacrifices to the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	63	Solomon sacrificed friendship offerings to the Lord . He sacrificed 22,000 oxen . He also sacrificed 120,000 sheep and goats . So the king and the whole community set the temple of the Lord apart to him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	64	On that same day the king set the middle area of the courtyard apart to the Lord . It was in front of the Lord ’ s temple . There Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and grain offerings . He also sacrificed the fat of the friendship offerings there . He did it there because the bronze altar that stood in front of the Lord was too small . It wasn ’ t big enough to hold all the burnt offerings , the grain offerings and the fat of the friendship offerings .
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	65	At that time Solomon celebrated the Feast of Booths . The whole community of Israel was with him . It was a huge crowd . People came from as far away as Lebo Hamath and the Wadi of Egypt . For seven days they celebrated in front of the Lord our God . The feast continued for seven more days . That made a total of
NIRV	1%20Kings	8	66	On the following day Solomon sent the people away . They asked the Lord to bless the king . Then they went home . The people were glad . Their hearts were full of joy . That ’ s because the Lord had done so many good things for his servant David and his people Israel . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Kings	9	9	People will answer , ‘ Because they have deserted the Lord their God . He brought out of Egypt their people of long ago . But they have been holding on to other gods . They ’ ve been worshiping them . They ’ ve been serving them . That ’ s why the Lord has brought all this horrible trouble on them. ’ ” Other Things Solomon Did
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	2	The Lord appeared to him a second time . He had already appeared to him at Gibeon .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	3	The Lord said to him , “ I have heard you pray to me . I have heard you ask me to help you . You have built this temple . I have set it apart for myself . My Name will be there forever . My eyes and my heart will always be there .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	4	“ But you must walk faithfully with me , just as your father David did . Your heart must be honest . It must be without blame . Do everything I command you to do . Obey my rules and laws .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	5	Then I will set up your royal throne over Israel forever . I promised your father David I would do that . I said to him , ‘ You will always have a son from your family line on the throne of Israel. ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	6	“ But suppose all of you turn away from me . Or your children turn away from me . You refuse to obey the commands and rules I have given you . And you go off to serve other gods and worship them .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	7	Then I will remove Israel from the land . It is the land I gave them . I will turn my back on this temple . I will do it even though I have set it apart for my Name to be there . Then Israel will be hated by all the nations . They will laugh and joke about Israel .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	8	This temple will become a pile of stones . All those who pass by it will be shocked . They will make fun of it . And they will say , ‘ Why has the Lord done a thing like this to this land and temple ? ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	10	Solomon built the Lord ’ s temple and the royal palace . It took him
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	20	There were still many people left in the land who weren ’ t Israelites . They included Amorites , Hittites , Perizzites , Hivites and Jebusites .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	11	King Solomon gave
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	12	Hiram went from Tyre to see the towns Solomon had given him . But he wasn ’ t pleased with them .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	13	“ My friend , ” he asked , “ what have you given me ? What kind of towns are these ? ” So he called them the Land of Kabul . And that ’ s what they are still called to this day .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	14	Hiram had sent four and a half tons of gold to Solomon .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	15	King Solomon forced people to work hard for him . Here is a record of what they did . They built the Lord ’ s temple and Solomon ’ s palace . They filled in the low places . They rebuilt the wall of Jerusalem . They built up Hazor , Megiddo and Gezer .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	16	tons of gold . They gave it to King Solomon . Copyright ©
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	17	Solomon rebuilt Gezer . He built up Lower Beth Horon
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	18	and Baalath . He built up Tadmor in the desert . All those towns were in his land .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	19	He built up all the cities where he could store things . He also built up the towns for his chariots and horses . He built anything he wanted to build in Jerusalem , Lebanon and all the territory he ruled over .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	21	They were children of the people who had lived in the land before the Israelites came . Those people had been set apart to the Lord in a special way to be destroyed . But the Israelites hadn ’ t been able to kill all of them . Solomon forced them to work very hard as his slaves . And they still work for Israel as slaves to this day .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	22	But Solomon didn ’ t force any of the Israelites to work as his slaves . Instead , some were his fighting men . Others were his government officials , his officers and his captains . Others were commanders of his chariots and chariot drivers .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	23	Still others were the chief officials in charge of Solomon ’ s projects . There were
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	550	officials in charge of those who did the work .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	24	Pharaoh ’ s daughter moved from the City of David up to the palace Solomon had built for her . After that , he filled in the low places near the palace .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	25	Three times a year Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and friendship offerings . He sacrificed them on the altar he had built to honor the Lord . Along with the offerings , he burned incense to the Lord . So he carried out his duties for the temple .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	26	King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber . It ’ s near Elath in Edom . It ’ s on the shore of the Red Sea .
NIRV	1%20Kings	9	27	Hiram sent his men to serve on the ships together with Solomon ’ s men . Hiram ’ s sailors knew the sea .

NIRV	1%20Kings	10	1	Kings
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	10	She gave the king four and a half tons of gold . She also gave him huge amounts of spices and valuable jewels . No one would ever bring to King Solomon as many spices as the queen of Sheba gave him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	2	She arrived in Jerusalem with a very large group of attendants . Her camels were carrying spices , huge amounts of gold , and valuable jewels . She came to Solomon and asked him about everything she wanted to know .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	3	Solomon answered all her questions . There wasn ’ t anything too hard for the king to explain to her .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	4	So the queen of Sheba saw how very wise Solomon was . She saw the palace he had built .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	5	She saw the food on his table . She saw his officials sitting there . She saw the robes of the servants who waited on everyone . She saw his wine tasters . And she saw the burnt offerings Solomon sacrificed at the Lord ’ s temple . She could hardly believe everything she had seen .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	6	She said to the king , “ Back in my own country I heard a report about you . I heard about how much you had accomplished . I also heard about how wise you are . Everything I heard is true .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	7	But I didn ’ t believe those things . So I came to see for myself . And now I believe it ! You are twice as wise and wealthy as people say you are . The report I heard doesn ’ t even begin to tell the whole story about you .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	8	How happy your people must be ! How happy your officials must be ! They always get to serve you and hear the wise things you say .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	9	May the Lord your God be praised . He takes great delight in you . He placed you on the throne of Israel . The Lord will love Israel for all time to come . That ’ s why he has made you king . He knows that you will do what is fair and right. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	11	Hiram ’ s ships brought gold from Ophir . From there they also brought huge amounts of almugwood and valuable jewels .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	12	The king used the almugwood to make supports for the Lord ’ s temple and the royal palace . He also used it to make harps and lyres for those who played the music . That much almugwood has never been brought into Judah or seen there since that day .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	13	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she wanted and asked for . That was in addition to what he had given her out of his royal riches . Then she left . She returned to her own country with her attendants . Solomon ’ s Greatness
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	14	Each year Solomon received
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	25	Year after year , everyone who came to him brought a gift . They brought gifts made out of silver and gold . They brought robes , weapons and spices . They also brought horses and mules .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	15	pounds of silver for a chariot from Egypt . And they weighed out almost four pounds of silver for a horse . They also sold horses and chariots to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Arameans . Copyright ©
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	16	King Solomon made
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	200	large shields out of hammered gold . Each one weighed
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	17	He also made
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	300	small shields out of hammered gold . Each one weighed seven and a half pounds . The king put all the shields in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	18	Then he made a large throne . It was covered with ivory . And that was covered with fine gold .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	19	The throne had six steps . Its back had a rounded top . The throne had armrests on both sides of the seat . A statue of a lion stood on each side of the throne .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	20	Twelve lions stood on the six steps . There was one at each end of each step . Nothing like that throne had ever been made for any other kingdom .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	21	All of King Solomon ’ s cups were made out of gold . All the things used in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were made out of pure gold . Nothing was made out of silver . When Solomon was king , silver wasn ’ t considered to be worth very much .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	22	He had many ships that carried goods to be traded . His ships went to sea along with Hiram ’ s ships . Once every three years the ships returned . They brought gold , silver , ivory , apes and peacocks .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	23	King Solomon was richer than all the other kings on earth . He was also wiser than they were .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	24	People from the whole world wanted to meet Solomon in person . They wanted to see for themselves how wise God had made him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	26	Solomon had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses . He kept some of his horses and chariots in the chariot cities . He kept the others with him in Jerusalem .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	27	The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones . He made cedar wood as common there as sycamore-fig trees in the western hills .
NIRV	1%20Kings	10	28	Solomon got horses from Egypt and from Kue . The royal traders bought them from Kue at the current price .

NIRV	1%20Kings	11	11	So the Lord said to Solomon , “ You have chosen not to keep my covenant . You have decided not to obey my rules . I commanded you to do what I told you . But you did not do it . So you can be absolutely sure I will tear the kingdom away from you . I will give it to one of your officials .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	2	The Lord had warned Israel about women from other nations . He had said , “ You must not marry them . If you do , you can be sure they will turn your hearts toward their gods. ” But Solomon continued to love them anyway . He wouldn ’ t give them up .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	3	He had
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	700	wives who came from royal families . And he had
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	300	concubines . His wives led him astray .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	4	As Solomon grew older , his wives turned his heart toward other gods . He didn ’ t follow the Lord his God with all his heart . So he wasn ’ t like his father David .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	5	Solomon worshiped Ashtoreth . Ashtoreth was the female god of the Sidonians . He also worshiped Molek . Molek was the god of the Ammonites . The Lord hated that god .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	6	Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . He didn ’ t completely obey the Lord . He didn ’ t do what his father David had done .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	7	There is a hill east of Jerusalem . Solomon built a high place for worshiping Chemosh there . He built a high place for worshiping Molek there too . Chemosh was the god of Moab . Molek was the god of Ammon . The Lord hated both of those gods .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	8	Solomon also built high places so that all his wives from other nations could worship their gods . Those women burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	9	The Lord became angry with Solomon . That ’ s because his heart had turned away from the Lord , the God of Israel . He had appeared to Solomon twice .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	10	He had commanded Solomon not to worship other gods . But Solomon didn ’ t obey the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	12	pieces .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	13	But I will not tear the whole kingdom away from him . I will give him one of the tribes because of my servant David . I will also do it because of Jerusalem . That is the city I have chosen. ” Solomon ’ s Enemies
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	14	Then the Lord brought an enemy against Solomon . The enemy ’ s name was Hadad . He was from Edom . In fact , he belonged to the royal family of Edom .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	15	David had fought against Edom . Joab had been the commander of the army . He had gone up to bury the dead bodies of the Israelites who had been killed in battle . At that time he had struck down all the men in Edom .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	16	In fact , Joab and all the men of Israel stayed there for six months . During that time they destroyed all the men in Edom .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	17	But when Hadad was only a boy , he ran away to Egypt . Some officials from Edom went with him . They had served Hadad ’ s father .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	18	They started out from Midian and went to Paran . They took some people from Paran with them . Then they went to Egypt . They went to Pharaoh , the king of Egypt . He gave Hadad a house and some land . He also supplied him with food .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	19	Pharaoh was very pleased with Hadad . Pharaoh ’ s wife was Queen Tahpenes . He gave Hadad her sister to be his wife .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	20	The sister of Tahpenes had a son by Hadad . The baby was named Genubath . Tahpenes brought him up in the royal palace . Genubath lived there with Pharaoh ’ s own children .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	21	Hadad heard that David had joined the members of his family who had already died . He also heard that Joab , the commander of the army , was dead . Hadad heard those things while he was in Egypt . He said to Pharaoh , “ Let me go . I want to return to my own country. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	22	“ Why do you want to go back to your own country ? ” Pharaoh asked . “ Don ’ t you have everything you need right here ? ” “ Yes , ” Hadad replied . “ But I want you to let me go anyway ! ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	23	God brought another enemy against Solomon . The enemy ’ s name was Rezon . He was the son of Eliada . Rezon had run away from his master Hadadezer , the king of Zobah .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	24	David had destroyed Zobah ’ s army . Then Rezon gathered together some men to follow him . He became their leader . They went to Damascus where they made their homes . They also took control of Damascus .

NIRV	1%20Kings	11	26	Jeroboam refused to follow King Solomon . He was one of Solomon ’ s officials . He was from Zeredah in the territory of Ephraim . His father was Nebat . His mother was a widow named Zeruah .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	27	Here is the story of how Jeroboam refused to follow the king . Solomon had filled in the low places near the palace . He had also repaired the wall of the city of his father David .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	28	Jeroboam was a very important young man . Solomon saw how well he did his work . So he put him in charge of all the workers in northern Israel .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	29	About that time Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem . Ahijah the prophet met him on the road . Ahijah was from Shiloh . He was wearing a new coat . The two of them were all alone out in the country .

NIRV	1%20Kings	11	32	Solomon will have one of its tribes . I will let him keep it because of my servant David and because of Jerusalem . I have chosen that city out of all the cities in the tribes of Israel .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	33	I will do these things because the tribes have deserted me . They have worshiped Ashtoreth , the female god of the people of Sidon . They have worshiped Chemosh , the god of the people of Moab . And they have worshiped Molek , the god of the people of Ammon . They have not lived the way I wanted them to . They have not done what is right in my eyes . They have not obeyed my rules and laws as Solomon ’ s father David did .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	34	“ ‘ But I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon ’ s hand . I have made him ruler all the days of his life . I have done it because of my servant David . I chose him , and he obeyed my commands and rules .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	35	I will take the kingdom out of his son ’ s hands . And I will give you ten of the tribes .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	36	I will give one of the tribes to David ’ s son . Then my servant David will always have a son on his throne in Jerusalem . The lamp of David ’ s kingdom will always burn brightly in my sight . Jerusalem is the city I chose for my Name .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	37	But I will make you king over Israel . You will rule over everything your heart desires . So you will be the king of Israel .
NIRV	1%20Kings	11	38	Do everything I command you to do . Live the way I want you to . Do what is right in my eyes . Obey my rules and commands . That is what my servant David did .

NIRV	1%20Kings	12	1	Kings
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	12	Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam . That ’ s because the king had said , “ Come back to me in three days. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	2	Jeroboam heard about it . He was the son of Nebat . Jeroboam was still in Egypt at that time . He had gone there for safety . He wanted to get away from King Solomon . But now he returned from Egypt .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	3	So the people sent for Jeroboam . He and the whole community of Israel went to Rehoboam . They said to him ,
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	4	“ Your father put a heavy load on our shoulders . But now make our hard work easier . Make the heavy load on us lighter . Then we ’ ll serve you. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	5	Rehoboam answered , “ Go away for three days . Then come back to me. ” So the people went away .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	6	King Rehoboam asked the elders for advice . They had served his father Solomon while he was still living . Rehoboam asked them , “ What advice can you give me ? How should I answer these people ? ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	7	They replied , “ Serve them today . Give them what they are asking for . Then they ’ ll always serve you. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	8	But Rehoboam didn ’ t accept the advice the elders gave him . Instead , he asked for advice from the young men . They had grown up with him and were now serving him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	9	He asked them , “ What ’ s your advice ? How should I answer these people ? They say to me , ‘ Make the load your father put on our shoulders lighter. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	10	The young men who had grown up with him gave their answer . They replied , “ These people have said to you , ‘ Your father put a heavy load on our shoulders . Make it lighter. ’ Now tell them , ‘ My little finger is stronger than my father ’ s legs .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	11	My father put a heavy load on your shoulders . But I ’ ll make it even heavier . My father beat you with whips . But I ’ ll beat you with bigger whips. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	13	The king answered the people in a mean way . He didn ’ t accept the advice the elders had given him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	14	Instead , he followed the advice of the young men . He said , “ My father put a heavy load on your shoulders . But I ’ ll make it even heavier . My father beat you with whips . But I ’ ll beat you with bigger whips. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	15	So the king didn ’ t listen to the people . That ’ s because the Lord had planned it that way . What he had said through Ahijah came true . Ahijah had spoken the Lord ’ s message to Jeroboam , the son of Nebat . Ahijah was from Shiloh .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	16	All the Israelites saw that the king refused to listen to them . So they answered the king . They said , “ We don ’ t have any share in David ’ s royal family . We don ’ t have any share in Jesse ’ s son . People of Israel , let ’ s go back to our homes . David ’ s royal family , take care of your own kingdom ! ” So the Israelites went home .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	17	But Rehoboam still ruled over the Israelites living in the towns of Judah .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	18	Adoniram was in charge of those who were forced to work hard for King Rehoboam . The king sent him out among all the Israelites . But they killed Adoniram by throwing stones at him . King Rehoboam was able to get away in his chariot . He escaped to Jerusalem .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	19	Israel has refused to follow the royal family of David to this day .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	20	All the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned . They sent for him . They wanted him to meet with the whole community . Then they made him king over the entire nation of Israel . Only the tribe of Judah remained true to David ’ s royal family .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	21	Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem . He brought together 180,000 capable young men from Judah and the tribe of Benjamin . He had decided to go to war against Israel . Solomon ’ s son Rehoboam wanted his fighting men to get the kingdom of Israel back for him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	22	But a message from God came to Shemaiah . He was a man of God . God said to him ,
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	23	“ Speak to Solomon ’ s son Rehoboam , the king of Judah . Speak to all Judah and the tribe of Benjamin . Also speak to the rest of the people . Tell all of them ,
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	24	‘ The Lord says , “ Do not go up to fight against the Israelites . They are your relatives . I want every one of you to go back home . Things have happened exactly the way I planned them. ” ’ ” So the fighting men obeyed the Lord ’ s message . They went home again , just as he had ordered . Golden Calves at Bethel and Dan
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	25	Jeroboam built up the walls of Shechem . It was in the hill country of Ephraim . Jeroboam made Shechem his home . From there he went out and built up Peniel .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	26	Jeroboam thought , “ My kingdom still isn ’ t secure . It could very easily go back to the royal family of David .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	27	Suppose the Israelites go up to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices at the Lord ’ s temple . If they do , they will again decide to follow Rehoboam as their master . Then they ’ ll kill me . They ’ ll return to King Rehoboam . He is king of Judah. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	28	So King Jeroboam asked for advice . Then he made two golden statues that looked like calves . He said to the people , “ It ’ s too hard for you to go up to Jerusalem . Israel , here are your gods who brought you up out of Egypt. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	29	He set up one statue in Bethel . He set up the other one in Dan .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	30	What Jeroboam did was sinful . And it caused Israel to sin . The people came to worship the statue at Bethel . They went all the way to Dan to worship the statue that was there .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	31	Jeroboam built temples for worshiping gods on high places . He appointed all kinds of people as priests . They didn ’ t even have to be Levites .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	32	He established a feast . It was on the 15th day of the eighth month . He wanted to make it like the Feast of Booths that was held in Judah . Jeroboam built an altar at Bethel . He offered sacrifices on it . He sacrificed to the calves he had made . He also put priests in Bethel . He did it at the high places he had made .
NIRV	1%20Kings	12	33	He offered sacrifices on the altar he had built at Bethel . It was on the 15th day of the eighth month . That ’ s the month he had chosen for it . So he established the feast for the Israelites . And he went up to the altar to sacrifice offerings . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Kings	13	1	Kings
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	13	So he said to his sons , “ Put a saddle on the donkey for me. ” When they had done it , he got on the donkey .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	2	The man cried out . He shouted a message from the Lord against the altar . He said , “ Altar ! Altar ! The Lord says , ‘ A son named Josiah will be born into the royal family of David . Altar , listen to me ! Josiah will sacrifice the priests of the high places on you . They will be the children of the priests who are offering sacrifices here . So human bones will be burned on you. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	3	That same day the man of God spoke about a miraculous sign . He said , “ Here is the sign the Lord has announced . This altar will be broken to pieces . The ashes on it will be spilled out. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	4	The man of God announced that message against the altar at Bethel . When King Jeroboam heard it , he reached out his hand from the altar . He said , “ Grab him ! ” But as he reached out his hand toward the man , it dried up . He couldn ’ t even pull it back .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	5	Also , the altar broke into pieces . Its ashes spilled out . That happened in keeping with the miraculous sign the man of God had announced . He had received a message from the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	6	King Jeroboam spoke to the man of God . He said , “ Pray to the Lord your God for me . Pray that my hand will be as good as new again. ” So the man of God prayed to the Lord for the king . And the king ’ s hand became as good as new . It was just as healthy as it had been before .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	7	The king said to the man of God , “ Come home with me for a meal . I ’ ll give you a gift. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	8	But the man of God replied to the king . He said , “ What if you were to give me half of what you own ? Even then I wouldn ’ t go with you . I wouldn ’ t eat bread or drink water here .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	9	The Lord gave me a command . He said , ‘ Do not eat bread or drink water there . Do not return the same way you came. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	10	So he took another road . He didn ’ t go back on the same road he had taken when he came to Bethel .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	11	An old prophet was living in Bethel . His sons came and spoke to him . They told him everything the man of God had done there that day . They also told their father what the man had said to the king .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	12	Their father asked them , “ Which way did he go ? ” His sons showed him the road the man of God from Judah had taken .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	14	He traveled on the same road the man of God had taken . He found the man sitting under an oak tree . He asked him , “ Are you the man of God who came from Judah ? ” “ I am , ” he replied .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	15	So the prophet said to him , “ Come home with me . I ’ ll give you something to eat. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	16	The man of God said , “ I can ’ t go back to Bethel with you . I can ’ t eat bread or drink water with you there .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	17	I ’ ve received a message from the Lord . He told me , ‘ Do not eat bread or drink water there . Do not return the same way you came. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	18	The old prophet answered , “ I ’ m also a prophet , just like you . An angel gave me a message from the Lord . The message said , ‘ Bring the man of God back with you to your house . Then he can eat bread and drink water with you. ’ ” But the old prophet was telling him a lie .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	19	The man of God returned with him . He ate and drank in his house .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	20	They were sitting at the table . The Lord gave a message to the old prophet who had brought the man of God back .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	21	He cried out to the man who had come from Judah . He told him , “ The Lord says , ‘ You have not done what I told you to do . You have not obeyed the command I gave you . I am the Lord your God .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	22	You came back here and ate bread and drank water . You did it in the place where I told you not to . So your body will not be buried in your family tomb. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	23	The man of God finished eating and drinking . Then the old prophet who had brought him back put a saddle on the man ’ s donkey for him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	24	And the man went on his way . A lion attacked him on the road and killed him . His body was left lying on the road . The donkey and the lion were standing beside it .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	25	Some people passed by . They saw the body lying on the road . They saw the lion standing beside the body . Then they went and reported it in the city where the old prophet lived .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	26	The prophet who had brought the man back from his journey heard about what had happened . He said , “ It ’ s the man of God . He didn ’ t do what the Lord told him to do . So the Lord has given him over to the lion . The lion has attacked him and killed him . Everything has happened just as the Lord ’ s message had warned him it would. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	27	The old prophet said to his sons , “ Put a saddle on the donkey for me. ” So they did .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	28	Then he went out . He found the body of the man of God lying on the road . The donkey and the lion were standing beside it . The lion hadn ’ t eaten the body . It hadn ’ t attacked the donkey either .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	29	So the prophet picked up the man ’ s body . He put it on the donkey . He brought it back to his own city . He wanted to mourn for him and bury him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	30	Then he placed the body in his own tomb . People mourned for him . They said , “ Oh , no , my friend ! My dear friend ! ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	31	After the old prophet had buried the the man of God , he spoke to his sons . He said , “ When I die , bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried . Put my bones next to his bones .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	32	I want you to do that because he announced a message from the Lord . He spoke against the altar in Bethel . He also spoke against all the temples that are on the high places . They are in the towns of Samaria . What the man of God said will certainly come true. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	33	Even after all of that happened , Jeroboam still didn ’ t change his evil ways . Once more he appointed priests for the high places . He made priests out of all kinds of people . In fact , he let anyone become a priest who wanted to . He set them apart to serve at the high places .
NIRV	1%20Kings	13	34	All of that was the great sin the royal family of Jeroboam committed . It led to their fall from power . Because of it , they were destroyed from the face of the earth . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Kings	14	3	Take ten loaves of bread with you . Take some cakes and a jar of honey . Go to him . He ’ ll tell you what will happen to our son. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	14	4	So Jeroboam ’ s wife did what he said . She went to Ahijah ’ s house in Shiloh . Ahijah couldn ’ t see . He was blind because he was so old .
NIRV	1%20Kings	14	5	But the Lord had told Ahijah , “ Jeroboam ’ s wife is coming . Her son is sick . She ’ ll ask you about him . Give her the answer I give you . When she arrives , she ’ ll pretend to be someone else. ”

NIRV	1%20Kings	14	13	All the Israelites will mourn for him . Then he will be buried . He is the only one who belongs to Jeroboam who will be buried . That is because he is the only one in Jeroboam ’ s royal house in whom I have found anything good . I am the Lord , the God of Israel .
NIRV	1%20Kings	14	15	I , the Lord , will strike down Israel . Israel will be like tall grass swaying in the water . I will pull Israel up from this good land by the roots . I gave it to their people who lived long ago . I will scatter Israel to the east side of the Euphrates River . That is because they made the Lord very angry . They made poles used to worship the female god named Asherah .

NIRV	1%20Kings	17	4	You will drink water from the brook . I have directed some ravens to supply you with food there. ”

NIRV	1%20Kings	17	9	“ Go right away to Zarephath in the region of Sidon . Stay there . I have directed a widow there to supply you with food. ”

NIRV	1%20Kings	17	13	Elijah said to her , “ Don ’ t be afraid . Go home . Do what you have said . But first make a small loaf of bread for me . Make it out of what you have . Bring it to me . Then make some for yourself and your son .
NIRV	1%20Kings	17	14	The Lord is the God of Israel . He says , ‘ The jar of flour will not be used up . The jug will always have oil in it . You will have flour and oil until the day the Lord sends rain on the land. ’ ”

NIRV	1%20Kings	17	18	The woman said to Elijah , “ You are a man of God . What do you have against me ? Did you come to bring my sin out into the open ? Did you come to kill my son ? ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	17	19	“ Give me your son , ” Elijah replied . He took him from her arms . He carried him to the upstairs room where he was staying . He put him down on his bed .

NIRV	1%20Kings	18	18	“ I haven ’ t made trouble for Israel , ” Elijah replied . “ But you and your father ’ s family have . You have turned away from the Lord ’ s commands . You have followed gods that are named Baal .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	2	So Elijah went to speak to Ahab . There wasn ’ t enough food in Samaria . The people there were very hungry .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	3	Ahab had sent for Obadiah . He was in charge of Ahab ’ s palace . Obadiah had great respect for the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	4	Ahab ’ s wife Jezebel had been killing off the Lord ’ s prophets . So Obadiah had hidden
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	100	of them in two caves . I put
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	50	in each cave . I supplied them with food and water .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	5	Ahab had said to Obadiah , “ Go through the land . Go to all the valleys and springs of water . Maybe we can find some grass there . It will keep the horses and mules alive . Then we won ’ t have to kill any of our animals. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	6	So they decided where each of them would look . Ahab went in one direction . Obadiah went in another .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	7	As Obadiah was walking along , Elijah met him . Obadiah recognized him . He bowed down to the ground . He said , “ My master Elijah ! Is it really you ? ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	8	“ Yes , ” he replied . “ Go and tell your master Ahab , ‘ Elijah is here. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	9	“ What have I done wrong ? ” asked Obadiah . “ Why are you handing me over to Ahab to be put to death ?
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	10	My master has sent people to look for you everywhere . There isn ’ t a nation or kingdom where he hasn ’ t sent someone to look for you . Suppose a nation or kingdom would claim you weren ’ t there . Then Ahab would make them give their word that they couldn ’ t find you . And that ’ s just as sure as the Lord your God is alive .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	11	But now you are telling me to go to my master . You want me to say , ‘ Elijah is here. ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	12	stones . There was one for each tribe in the family line of Jacob . The Lord ’ s message had come to Jacob . It had said , “ Your name will be Israel. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	13	My master , haven ’ t you heard what I did ? Jezebel was killing the Lord ’ s prophets . But I hid
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	14	And now you are telling me to go to my master Ahab . You want me to say to him , ‘ Elijah is here. ’ Ahab will kill me ! ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	15	Elijah said , “ I serve the Lord who rules over all . You can be sure that he lives . And you can be just as sure that I will speak to Ahab today. ” Elijah on Mount Carmel
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	16	Obadiah went back to Ahab . He told Ahab that Elijah wanted to see him . So Ahab went to where Elijah was .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	17	When he saw Elijah , he said to him , “ Is that you ? You are always stirring up trouble in Israel. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	19	Now send for people from all over Israel . Tell them to meet me on Mount Carmel . And bring the
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	450	prophets .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	400	prophets of the female god named Asherah . All of them eat at Jezebel ’ s table. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	20	So Ahab sent that message all through Israel . He gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	21	Elijah went there and stood in front of the people . He said , “ How long will it take you to make up your minds ? If the Lord is the one and only God , worship him . But if Baal is the one and only God , worship him. ” The people didn ’ t say anything .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	22	Then Elijah said to them , “ I ’ m the only one of the Lord ’ s prophets left . But Baal has
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	23	Get two bulls for us . Let Baal ’ s prophets choose one for themselves . Let them cut it into pieces . Then let them put it on the wood . But don ’ t let them set fire to it . I ’ ll prepare the other bull . I ’ ll put it on the wood . But I won ’ t set fire to it .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	24	pounds of seeds .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	25	Elijah said to the prophets of Baal , “ Choose one of the bulls . There are many of you . So prepare your bull first . Pray to your god . But don ’ t light the fire. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	26	So they prepared the bull they had been given . They prayed to Baal from morning until noon . “ Baal ! Answer us ! ” they shouted . But there wasn ’ t any reply . No one answered . Then they danced around the altar they had made .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	27	At noon Elijah began to tease them . “ Shout louder ! ” he said . “ I ’ m sure Baal is a god ! Perhaps he has too much to think about . Or maybe he has gone to the toilet . Or perhaps he ’ s away on a trip . Maybe he ’ s sleeping . You might have to wake him up. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	28	So they shouted louder . They cut themselves with swords and spears until their blood flowed . That ’ s what they usually did when things really looked hopeless .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	29	It was now past noon . The prophets of Baal continued to prophesy with all their might . They did it until the time came to offer the evening sacrifice . But there wasn ’ t any reply . No one answered . No one paid any attention .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	30	Then Elijah said to all the people , “ Come here to me. ” So they went to him . He rebuilt the altar of the Lord . It had been torn down .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	31	Elijah got
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	32	Elijah used the stones to build an altar to honor the Lord . He dug a ditch around it . The ditch was large enough to hold
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	33	He arranged the wood for the fire . He cut the bull into pieces . He placed the pieces on the wood . Then he said to some of the people , “ Fill four large jars with water . Pour it on the offering and the wood. ” So they did .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	34	“ Do it again , ” he said . So they did it again . “ Do it a third time , ” he ordered . And they did it the third time .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	35	The water ran down around the altar . It even filled the ditch .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	36	When it was time to offer the evening sacrifice , the prophet Elijah stepped forward . He prayed , “ Lord , you are the God of Abraham , Isaac and Israel . Today let everyone know that you are God in Israel . Let them know I ’ m your servant . Let them know I ’ ve done all these things because you commanded me to .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	37	Answer me . Lord , answer me . Then these people will know that you are the one and only God . They ’ ll know that you are turning their hearts back to you again. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	38	The fire of the Lord came down . It burned up the sacrifice . It burned up the wood and the stones and the soil . It even dried up the water in the ditch .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	39	All the people saw it . Then they fell down flat with their faces toward the ground . They cried out , “ The Lord is the one and only God ! The Lord is the one and only God ! ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	40	Then Elijah commanded them , “ Grab the prophets of Baal . Don ’ t let a single one of them get away ! ” So they grabbed them . Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley . There he had them put to death .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	41	Elijah said to Ahab , “ Go . Eat and drink . I can hear the sound of a heavy rain. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	42	So Ahab went off to eat and drink . But Elijah climbed to the top of Mount Carmel . He bent down toward the ground . Then he put his face between his knees .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	43	“ Go and look toward the sea , ” he told his servant . So he went up and looked . “ I don ’ t see anything there , ” he said . Seven times Elijah said , “ Go back. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	44	The seventh time the servant said , “ I see a cloud . It ’ s as small as a man ’ s hand . It ’ s coming up over the sea. ” Elijah said , “ Go to Ahab . Tell him , ‘ Tie your chariot to your horse . Go down to Jezreel before the rain stops you. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	45	Black clouds filled the sky . The wind came up , and a heavy rain began to fall . Ahab rode off to Jezreel .
NIRV	1%20Kings	18	46	The power of the Lord came on Elijah . He tucked his coat into his belt . And he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Kings	19	3	Elijah was afraid . So he ran for his life . He came to Beersheba in Judah . He left his servant there .
NIRV	1%20Kings	19	4	Then he traveled for one day into the desert . He came to a small bush . He sat down under it . He prayed that he would die . “ Lord , I ’ ve had enough , ” he said . “ Take my life . I ’ m no better than my people of long ago. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	19	5	Then he lay down under the bush . And he fell asleep . Suddenly an angel touched him . The angel said , “ Get up and eat. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	19	6	Elijah looked around . Near his head he saw some bread . It had been baked over hot coals . A jar of water was also there . So Elijah ate and drank . Then he lay down again .
NIRV	1%20Kings	19	7	The angel of the Lord came to him a second time . He touched him and said , “ Get up and eat . Your journey will be long and hard. ”

It broke up the rocks . But the Lord wasn ’ t in the wind . After the wind there was an earthquake . But the Lord wasn ’ t in the earthquake .

NIRV	1%20Kings	19	20	Then Elisha left his oxen . He ran after Elijah . “ Let me kiss my father and mother goodbye , ” he said . “ Then I ’ ll come with you. ” “ Go back , ” Elijah replied . “ What have I done to you ? ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	19	21	So Elisha left him and went back . He got his two oxen and killed them . He burned the plow to cook the meat . He gave it to the people , and they ate it . Then he started to follow Elijah . He became Elijah ’ s servant . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Kings	20	1	Kings
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	20	Each man struck down the one fighting against him . When that happened , the army of Aram ran away . The Israelites chased them . But Ben-Hadad , the king of Aram , escaped on a horse . Some of his horsemen escaped with him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	32	So they wore rough clothing . They tied ropes around their heads . Then they went to the king of Israel . They told him , “ Your servant Ben-Hadad says , ‘ Please let me live. ’ ” The king answered , “ Is he still alive ? He used to be my friend. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	2	Ben-Hadad sent messengers into the city . They spoke to Ahab , the king of Israel . They told him , “ Ben-Hadad says ,
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	3	‘ Your silver and gold belong to me . The best of your wives and children also belong to me. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	4	The king of Israel replied , “ What you say is true . You are my king and master . I belong to you . And everything I have belongs to you. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	5	The messengers came again . They told Ahab , “ Ben-Hadad says , ‘ I commanded you to give me your silver and gold . I also commanded you to give me your wives and children .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	6	But now I ’ m going to send my officials to you . They will come about this time tomorrow . They ’ ll search your palace . They ’ ll search the houses of your officials . They ’ ll take everything you value . And they ’ ll carry it all away. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	7	The king of Israel sent for all the elders of the land . He said to them , “ This man is really looking for trouble ! He sent for my wives and children . He sent for my silver and gold . And I agreed to give them to him. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	8	All the elders and people answered , “ Don ’ t listen to him . Don ’ t agree to give him what he wants. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	9	So Ahab replied to Ben-Hadad ’ s messengers . He said , “ Tell my king and master , ‘ I will do everything you commanded me to do the first time . But this time , I can ’ t do what you want me to do. ’ ” They took Ahab ’ s answer back to Ben-Hadad .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	10	Then Ben-Hadad sent another message to Ahab . Ben-Hadad said , “ There won ’ t be enough dust left in Samaria to give each of my followers even a handful . If there is , may the gods punish me greatly. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	11	The king of Israel replied . He said , “ Tell him , ‘ Someone who puts his armor on shouldn ’ t brag like someone who takes it off. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	12	Ben-Hadad and the kings were in their tents drinking . That ’ s when he heard the message . He ordered his men , “ Get ready to attack. ” So they prepared to attack the city . Ahab Wins the Battle Over Ben-Hadad
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	13	During that time a prophet came to Ahab , the king of Israel . He announced , “ The Lord says , ‘ Do you see this huge army ? I will hand it over to you today . Then you will know that I am the Lord. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	14	“ But who will do it ? ” Ahab asked . The prophet answered , “ The Lord says , ‘ The junior officers who are under the area commanders will do it. ’ ” “ And who will start the battle ? ” Ahab asked . The prophet answered , “ You will. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	15	So Ahab sent for the junior officers who were under the area commanders . The total number of officers was
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	232	. Ahab gathered together the rest of the Israelites . The total number of them was 7,000 .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	16	They started out at noon . At that time Ben-Hadad and the
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	17	The junior officers who were under Ahab ’ s area commanders marched out first . Ben-Hadad had sent out scouts . They came back and reported , “ Men are marching against us from Samaria. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	18	Ben-Hadad said , “ They might be coming to make peace . If they are , take them alive . Or they might be coming to make war . If they are , take them alive. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	19	The junior officers marched out of the city . The army was right behind them .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	21	The king of Israel attacked them . He overpowered the horses and chariots . Large numbers of the men of Aram were wounded or killed .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	22	After that , the prophet came to the king of Israel again . The prophet said , “ Make your position stronger . Do what needs to be done . Next spring the king of Aram will attack you again. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	23	During that time , the officials of the king of Aram gave him advice . They said , “ The gods of Israel are gods of the hills . That ’ s why they were too strong for us . But suppose we fight them on the plains . Then we ’ ll certainly be stronger than they are .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	24	Here ’ s what you should do . Don ’ t let any of the kings continue as military leaders . Have other officers take their places .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	25	You must also put another army together . It should be just like the one you lost . It should have the same number of horses and chariots . Then we ’ ll be able to fight against Israel on the plains . And we ’ ll certainly be stronger than they are. ” Ben-Hadad agreed with their advice . He did what they suggested .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	26	The next spring Ben-Hadad brought together the men of Aram . They went up to the city of Aphek to fight against Israel .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	27	The Israelites were also brought together . They were given supplies . They marched out to fight against their enemies . Israel ’ s army camped across from Aram ’ s army . The Israelites looked like two small flocks of goats that had become separated from the others . But the men of Aram covered the countryside .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	28	The man of God came up to the king of Israel again . He told him , “ The Lord says , ‘ The men of Aram think the Lord is a god of the hills . They do not think he is a god of the valleys . So I , the Lord , will hand their huge army over to you . Then you will know that I am the Lord. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	29	For seven days the two armies camped across from each other . On the seventh day the battle began . The Israelites wounded or killed 100,000 Aramean soldiers who were on foot . That happened in a single day .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	30	The rest of the men of Aram escaped to the city of Aphek . Its wall fell down on 27,000 of them . Ben-Hadad ran to the city . He hid in a secret room .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	31	His officials said to him , “ Look , we ’ ve heard that the kings of Israel often show mercy . So let ’ s go to the king of Israel . Let ’ s wear the rough clothing people wear when they ’ re sad . Let ’ s tie ropes around our heads . Perhaps Ahab will spare your life. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	33	The men thought that was good news . So they quickly used the word Ahab had used . “ Yes ! Your friend Ben-Hadad ! ” they said . “ Go and get him , ” the king said . Ben-Hadad came out of the secret room . Then Ahab had him get into his chariot .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	34	“ I ’ ll return the cities my father took from your father , ” Ben-Hadad offered . “ You can set up your own market areas in Damascus . That ’ s what my father did in Samaria. ” Ahab said , “ If we sign a peace treaty , I ’ ll set you free. ” So Ben-Hadad made a treaty with him . Then Ahab let him go . A Prophet Accuses Ahab
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	35	There was a group of people called the group of the prophets . A message from the Lord came to one of their members . He said to his companion , “ Strike me down with your weapon. ” But he wouldn ’ t do it .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	36	The prophet said , “ You haven ’ t obeyed the Lord . So as soon as you leave me , a lion will kill you. ” The companion went away . And a lion found him and killed him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	37	The prophet found another man . He said , “ Please strike me down. ” So the man struck him down and wounded him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	38	Then the prophet went and stood by the road . He waited for the king to come by . He pulled his headband down over his eyes so no one would recognize him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	39	The king passed by . Then the prophet called out to him . He said , “ I went into the middle of the battle . Someone came to me with a prisoner . He said , ‘ Guard this man . Don ’ t let him get away . If he does , you will pay for his life with yours . Or you can pay
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	75	pounds of silver. ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	40	While I was busy here and there , the man disappeared. ” The king of Israel spoke to him . He told him , “ What you ’ ve just said is what will happen to you. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	41	Then the prophet quickly removed the headband from his eyes . The king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets .
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	42	He told the king , “ The Lord says , ‘ You have set a man free . But I had said he should be set apart to the Lord in a special way to be destroyed . So you must pay for his life with yours . You must pay for his people ’ s lives with the lives of your people. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	20	43	The king of Israel was angry . He was in a bad mood . He went back to his palace in Samaria . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Kings	21	1	Kings
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	21	So the Lord says , ‘ I am going to bring horrible trouble on you . I will destroy your children after you . I will destroy every male in Israel who is related to you . It does not matter whether they are slaves or free .
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	2	Ahab said to Naboth , “ Let me have your vineyard . It ’ s close to my palace . I want to use it for a vegetable garden . I ’ ll trade you a better vineyard for it . Or , if you prefer , I ’ ll pay you what it ’ s worth. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	3	But Naboth replied , “ May the Lord keep me from giving you the land my family handed down to me. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	4	So Ahab went home . He was angry . He was in a bad mood because of what Naboth from Jezreel had said . He had told Ahab , “ I won ’ t give you the land my family handed down to me. ” So Ahab lay on his bed . He was in a very bad mood . He wouldn ’ t even eat anything .
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	5	His wife Jezebel came in . She asked him , “ Why are you in such a bad mood ? Why won ’ t you eat anything ? ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	6	He answered her , “ Because I spoke to Naboth from Jezreel . I said , ‘ Sell me your vineyard . Or , if you prefer , I ’ ll give you another vineyard in its place. ’ But he said , ‘ I won ’ t sell you my vineyard. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	7	His wife Jezebel said , “ Is this how the king of Israel acts ? Get up ! Eat something ! Cheer up . I ’ ll get you the vineyard of Naboth from Jezreel. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	8	So she wrote some letters in Ahab ’ s name . She stamped them with his royal seal . Then she sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in the city where Naboth lived .
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	9	In those letters she wrote , “ Announce a day when people are supposed to go without eating . Have Naboth sit in an important place among the people .
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	10	But put two worthless and evil men in seats across from him . Have them bring charges that he has cursed God and the king . Then take him out of the city . Kill him by throwing stones at him. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	11	So the elders and nobles who lived in that city did what Jezebel wanted . They did everything she directed in the letters she had written to them .
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	12	They announced a day of fasting . They had Naboth sit in an important place among the people .
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	13	Then two worthless and evil men came and sat across from him . They brought charges against Naboth in front of the people . The two men said , “ Naboth has cursed God and the king. ” So they took him outside the city . They killed him by throwing stones at him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	14	Then they sent a message to Jezebel . They said , “ Naboth is dead . We killed him by throwing stones at him. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	15	Jezebel heard that Naboth had been killed . As soon as she heard it , she said to Ahab , “ Get up . Take over the vineyard of Naboth from Jezreel . It ’ s the one he wouldn ’ t sell to you . He isn ’ t alive anymore . He ’ s dead. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	16	Ahab heard that Naboth was dead . So Ahab got up and went down to take over Naboth ’ s vineyard .
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	17	Then a message from the Lord came to Elijah , who was from Tishbe . The Lord said ,
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	18	“ Go down to see Ahab , the king of Israel . He rules in Samaria . You will find him in Naboth ’ s vineyard . Ahab has gone there to take it over .
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	19	Tell him , ‘ The Lord says , “ Haven ’ t you murdered a man ? Haven ’ t you taken over his property ? ” ’ Then tell Ahab , ‘ The Lord says , “ Dogs licked up Naboth ’ s blood . In that same place dogs will lick up your blood . Yes , I said your blood ! ” ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	20	Ahab said to Elijah , “ My enemy ! You have found me ! ” “ I have found you , ” he answered . “ That ’ s because you gave yourself over to do evil things . You did what was evil in the sight of the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	22	I will make your royal house like the house of Jeroboam , the son of Nebat . I will make it like the house of Baasha , the son of Ahijah . You have made me very angry . You have caused Israel to sin. ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	23	“ The Lord also says , ‘ Dogs will eat up Jezebel near the wall of Jezreel. ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	24	“ Some of the people who belong to Ahab will die in the city . Dogs will eat them up . Others will die in the country . The birds will eat them. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	25	There was never anyone like Ahab . He gave himself over to do what was evil in the sight of the Lord . His wife Jezebel talked him into it .
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	26	He acted in the most evil way . He worshiped statues of gods . He was like the Amorites . The Lord drove them out to make room for Israel .
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	27	When Ahab heard what Elijah had said , he tore his clothes . He put on the rough clothing people wear when they ’ re sad . He went without eating . He even slept in his clothes . He went around looking sad .
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	28	Then a message from the Lord came to Elijah , who was from Tishbe . The Lord said ,
NIRV	1%20Kings	21	29	“ Have you seen how Ahab has made himself humble in my sight ? Because he has done that , I will not bring trouble on him while he lives . But I will bring it on his royal house when his son is king. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Kings	22	22	“ ‘ How ? ’ the Lord asked . “ The spirit said , ‘ I ’ ll go out and put lies in the mouths of all his prophets. ’ “ ‘ You will have success in getting Ahab to attack Ramoth Gilead , ’ said the Lord . ‘ Go and do it. ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	2	In the third year Jehoshaphat went down to see Ahab , the king of Israel . Jehoshaphat was king of Judah .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	3	The king of Israel had spoken to his officials . He had said , “ Don ’ t you know that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us ? And we aren ’ t even doing anything to take it back from the king of Aram. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	4	So Ahab asked Jehoshaphat , “ Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead ? ” Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel , “ Yes . I ’ ll go with you . My men will go with you . My horses will also go with you. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	5	Jehoshaphat continued , “ First ask the Lord for advice. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	6	So the king of Israel brought about
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	400	prophets together . He asked them , “ Should I go to war against Ramoth Gilead ? Or should I stay here ? ” “ Go , ” they answered . “ The Lord will hand it over to you. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	7	But Jehoshaphat asked , “ Is there no longer a prophet of the Lord here ? If there is , ask him what we should do. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	8	The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat . He said , “ There is still one other man we can go to . We can ask the Lord for advice through him . But I hate him . He never prophesies anything good about me . He only prophesies bad things . His name is Micaiah . He ’ s the son of Imlah. ” “ You shouldn ’ t say bad things about him , ” Jehoshaphat replied .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	9	So the king of Israel called for one of his officials . He told him , “ Bring Micaiah , the son of Imlah , right away. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	10	The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat , the king of Judah , were wearing their royal robes . They were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor . It was near the entrance of the gate of Samaria . All the prophets were prophesying in front of them .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	11	Zedekiah was the son of Kenaanah . Zedekiah had made horns out of iron . They looked like animal horns . He announced , “ The Lord says , ‘ With these horns you will drive back the men of Aram until they are destroyed. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	12	All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing . “ Attack Ramoth Gilead , ” they said . “ Win the battle over it . The Lord will hand it over to you. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	13	A messenger went to get Micaiah . He said to him , “ Look . The other prophets agree . All of them are saying the king will have success . So agree with them . Say the same thing they do. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	14	But Micaiah said , “ You can be sure that the Lord lives . And here is something you can be just as sure of . I can only tell the king what the Lord tells me to say. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	15	When Micaiah arrived , the king spoke to him . He asked , “ Should we go to war against Ramoth Gilead , or not ? ” “ Attack , ” he answered . “ You will win . The Lord will hand Ramoth Gilead over to you. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	16	The king said to him , “ I ’ ve made you promise to tell the truth many times before . So don ’ t tell me anything but the truth in the name of the Lord. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	17	Then Micaiah answered , “ I saw all the Israelites scattered on the hills . They were like sheep that didn ’ t have a shepherd . The Lord said , ‘ These people do not have a master . Let each of them go home in peace. ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	18	The king of Israel spoke to Jehoshaphat . He said , “ Didn ’ t I tell you he never prophesies anything good about me ? He only prophesies bad things. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	19	Micaiah continued , “ Listen to the Lord ’ s message . I saw the Lord sitting on his throne . All the angels of heaven were standing around him . Some were standing at his right side . The others were standing at his left side .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	20	The Lord said , ‘ Who will get Ahab to attack Ramoth Gilead ? I want him to die there. ’ “ One angel suggested one thing . Another suggested something else .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	21	Finally , a spirit came forward and stood in front of the Lord . The spirit said , ‘ I ’ ll get Ahab to do it. ’
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	23	“ So the Lord has put lies in the mouths of all your prophets . He has said that great harm will come to you. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	24	Then Zedekiah , the son of Kenaanah , went up and slapped Micaiah in the face . Zedekiah asked Micaiah , “ Do you think the spirit sent by the Lord left me ? Do you think that spirit went to speak to you ? ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	25	years . His mother ’ s name was Azubah . She was the daughter of Shilhi .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	26	Then the king of Israel gave an order . He said , “ Take Micaiah away . Send him back to Amon . Amon is the ruler of the city of Samaria . And send him back to Joash . Joash is a member of the royal court .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	27	Tell him , ‘ The king says , “ Put this fellow in prison . Don ’ t give him anything but bread and water until I return safely. ” ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	28	Micaiah announced , “ Do you really think you will return safely ? If you do , the Lord hasn ’ t spoken through me. ” He continued , “ All of you people , remember what I ’ ve said ! ” Ahab Is Killed at Ramoth Gilead
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	29	So the king of Israel went up to Ramoth Gilead . Jehoshaphat , the king of Judah , went there too .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	30	The king of Israel spoke to Jehoshaphat . He said , “ I ’ ll go into battle wearing different clothes . Then people won ’ t recognize me . But you wear your royal robes. ” So the king of Israel put on different clothes . Then he went into battle .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	31	The king of Aram had given an order to his
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	32	The chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat . They thought , “ That has to be the king of Israel. ” So they turned to attack him . But Jehoshaphat cried out .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	33	Then the commanders saw he wasn ’ t the king of Israel after all . So they stopped chasing him .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	34	But someone shot an arrow without taking aim . The arrow hit the king of Israel between the parts of his armor . The king told his chariot driver , “ Turn the chariot around . Get me out of this battle . I ’ ve been wounded. ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	35	years old when he became king . He ruled in Jerusalem for
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	36	As the sun was setting , a cry spread through the army . “ Every man must go to his own town ! ” they said . “ Every man must go to his own land ! ”
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	37	So the king died . He was brought to Samaria . They buried him there .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	38	They washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria . It was where the prostitutes took baths . The dogs licked up Ahab ’ s blood . It happened exactly as the Lord had said it would .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	39	The other events of Ahab ’ s rule are written down . Everything he did is written down . That includes the palace he built and decorated with ivory . It also includes the cities he built up and put high walls around . All these things are written in the official records of the kings of Israel .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	40	Ahab joined the members of his family who had already died . Ahab ’ s son Ahaziah became the next king after him . Jehoshaphat King of Judah
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	41	Jehoshaphat began to rule over Judah . It was in the fourth year that Ahab was king of Israel . Jehoshaphat was the son of Asa .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	42	Jehoshaphat was
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	43	Jehoshaphat followed all the ways of his father Asa . He didn ’ t wander away from them . He did what was right in the sight of the Lord . But the high places weren ’ t removed . The people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense at them .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	44	Jehoshaphat was also at peace with the king of Israel .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	45	The other events of Jehoshaphat ’ s rule are written down . The brave things he did in battle and everything else he accomplished are written down . All these things are written in the official records of the kings of Judah .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	46	Jehoshaphat got rid of the rest of the male prostitutes who were at the temples . They had remained in the land even after the rule of his father Asa .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	47	At that time Edom didn ’ t have a king . An area governor was in charge .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	48	Jehoshaphat built many ships that he used to carry goods to be traded . The ships were supposed to go to Ophir for gold . But they never had a chance to sail . They were wrecked at Ezion Geber .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	49	At that time Ahaziah , the son of Ahab , spoke to Jehoshaphat . He said , “ Let my men sail with yours. ” But Jehoshaphat refused .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	50	Jehoshaphat joined the members of his family who had already died . He was buried in the family tomb in the city of King David . Jehoshaphat ’ s son Jehoram became the next king after him . Ahaziah King of Israel
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	51	Ahaziah became king of Israel in Samaria . It was in the 17th year that Jehoshaphat was king of Judah . Ahaziah ruled over Israel for two years . He was the son of Ahab .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	52	Ahaziah did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . He lived the way his father and mother had lived . He lived the way Jeroboam , the son of Nebat , had lived . Jeroboam had caused Israel to sin .
NIRV	1%20Kings	22	53	Ahaziah served and worshiped the god named Baal . He made the Lord , the God of Israel , very angry . That ’ s exactly what Ahaziah ’ s father had done . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Kings	1	2	Ahaziah had fallen through the window of his upstairs room in Samaria . He had hurt himself . So he sent messengers to ask the god named Baal-Zebub for advice . Baal-Zebub was the god of the city of Ekron . Ahaziah said to the messengers , “ Go and ask Baal-Zebub whether I will get well again. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	1	After King Ahab died , Moab refused to remain under Israel ’ s control .
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	3	But the angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah , who was from Tishbe . The angel said , “ Go up to see the messengers of Ahaziah , the king of Samaria . Tell them , ‘ You are on your way to ask Baal-Zebub for advice . He is the god of Ekron . Are you going there to pray to that god ? Do you think there is no God in Israel ? ’
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	4	The Lord says to Ahaziah , ‘ You will never leave the bed you are lying on . You can be sure that you will die ! ’ ” So Elijah went to see the messengers .
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	5	They returned to the king . He asked them , “ Why have you come back ? ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	6	“ A man met us on our way there , ” they replied . “ He said to us , ‘ Go back to the king who sent you . Tell him , “ The Lord says , ‘ You are sending messengers to ask Baal-Zebub for advice . He is the god of Ekron . Are you going there to pray to that god ? Do you think there is no God in Israel ? You will never leave the bed you are lying on . You can be sure that you will die ! ’ ” ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	7	The king asked the messengers , “ What kind of man came to see you ? Who told you these things ? ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	8	They replied , “ He was wearing clothes made out of hair . He had a leather belt around his waist. ” The king said , “ That was Elijah from Tishbe. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	9	Then Ahaziah sent a captain to Elijah . The captain had his group of
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	50	men !
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	10	Elijah answered the captain , “ If I ’ m really a man of God , may fire come down from heaven ! May it burn up you and your
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	11	After that happened , the king sent another captain to Elijah . The captain had his
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	12	Elijah replied , “ If I ’ m really a man of God , may fire come down from heaven ! May it burn up you and your
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	13	So the king sent a third captain with his
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	14	Fire has come down from heaven . It has burned up the first two captains and all their men . But please have respect for my life ! ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	15	The angel of the Lord said to Elijah , “ Go down along with him . Don ’ t be afraid of him. ” So Elijah got up and went down to the king with the captain .
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	16	Elijah told the king , “ The Lord says , ‘ You have sent messengers to ask Baal-Zebub for advice . He is the god of Ekron . Did you go there to pray to that god for advice ? Do you think there is no God in Israel ? You will never leave the bed you are lying on . You can be sure that you will die ! ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	1	17	So King Ahaziah died . It happened just as the Lord had said it would . He had spoken that message through Elijah . Ahaziah didn ’ t have any sons . So Joram , his younger brother , became the next king after him . It was the second year of Jehoram , the king of Judah . Jehoram was the son of Jehoshaphat .

NIRV	2%20Kings	2	2	Elijah said to Elisha , “ Stay here . The Lord has sent me to Bethel. ” But Elisha said , “ I won ’ t leave you . And that ’ s just as sure as the Lord and you are alive. ” So they went down to Bethel .
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	3	There was a group of prophets at Bethel . They came out to where Elisha was . They asked him , “ Do you know what the Lord is going to do ? He ’ s going to take your master away from you today. ” “ Yes , I know , ” Elisha replied . “ So be quiet. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	4	Then Elijah said to him , “ Stay here , Elisha . The Lord has sent me to Jericho. ” Elisha replied , “ I won ’ t leave you . And that ’ s just as sure as the Lord and you are alive. ” So they went to Jericho .
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	5	There was a group of prophets at Jericho . They went up to where Elisha was . They asked him , “ Do you know what the Lord is going to do ? He ’ s going to take your master away from you today. ” “ Yes , I know , ” Elisha replied . “ So be quiet. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	6	Then Elijah said to him , “ Stay here . The Lord has sent me to the Jordan River. ” Elisha replied , “ I won ’ t leave you . And that ’ s just as sure as the Lord and you are alive. ” So the two of them walked on .
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	7	Fifty men from the group of prophets followed them . The men stopped and stood not far away from them . They faced the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan River .
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	8	Elijah rolled up his coat . Then he struck the water with it . The water parted to the right and to the left . The two of them went across the river on dry ground .
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	9	After they had gone across , Elijah said to Elisha , “ Tell me . What can I do for you before I ’ m taken away from you ? ” “ Please give me a double share of your spirit , ” Elisha replied .
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	10	“ You have asked me for something that ’ s very hard to do , ” Elijah said . “ But suppose you see me when I ’ m taken away from you . Then you will receive what you have asked for . If you don ’ t see me , you won ’ t receive it. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	11	They kept walking along and talking together . Suddenly there appeared a chariot and horses made of fire . The chariot and horses came between the two men . Then Elijah went up to heaven in a strong wind .
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	12	Elisha saw it and cried out to Elijah , “ My father ! You are like a father to me ! You , Elijah , are the true chariots and horsemen of Israel ! ” Elisha didn ’ t see Elijah anymore . Then Elisha took hold of his own garment and tore it in two .
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	13	He picked up the coat that had fallen from Elijah . He went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan River .
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	14	Then he struck the water with Elijah ’ s coat . “ Where is the power of the Lord ? ” he asked . “ Where is the power of the God of Elijah ? ” When Elisha struck the water , it parted to the right and to the left . He went across the river .
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	15	The group of prophets from Jericho were watching . They said , “ The spirit of Elijah has been given to Elisha. ” They went over to Elisha . They bowed down to him with their faces toward the ground .
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	16	“ Look , ” they said . “ We have
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	50	men . They looked for Elijah for three days . But they didn ’ t find him .
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	17	But they kept asking until he felt he couldn ’ t say no . So he said , “ Send them. ” And they sent
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	18	So they returned to Elisha . He was staying in Jericho . Elisha said to them , “ Didn ’ t I tell you not to go ? ” Elisha Makes Jericho ’ s Water Pure
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	19	The people of Jericho said to Elisha , “ Look . This town has a good location . You can see that for yourself . But the spring of water here is bad . So the land doesn ’ t produce anything. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	20	“ Bring me a new bowl , ” Elisha said . “ Put some salt in it. ” So they brought it to him .
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	21	Then he went out to the spring . He threw the salt into it . He told the people , “ The Lord says , ‘ I have made this water pure . It will never cause death again . It will never keep the land from producing crops again. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	22	The water has stayed pure to this day . That ’ s what Elisha had said would happen . Some Boys Make Fun of Elisha
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	23	Elisha left Jericho and went up to Bethel . He was walking along the road . Some boys came out of the town . They made fun of him . “ Get out of here , baldy ! ” they said . “ Get out of here ! You don ’ t even have any hair on your head ! ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	24	He turned around and looked at them . And he asked for bad things to happen to them . He did it in the name of the Lord . Then two bears came out of the woods . They attacked
NIRV	2%20Kings	2	42	of the boys .

NIRV	2%20Kings	3	2	Joram did what was evil in the sight of the Lord . But he wasn ’ t as bad as his father and mother had been . Joram ’ s father had made a sacred stone used to worship the god named Baal . Joram got rid of it .
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	3	But he kept on committing the sins of Jeroboam , the son of Nebat . Jeroboam had also caused Israel to commit those same sins . Joram didn ’ t turn away from them .
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	12	Jehoshaphat said , “ The Lord speaks through him. ” So the king of Israel went down to see Elisha . Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom also went there .
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	4	Mesha raised sheep . He was king of Moab . He had to pay the king of Israel 100,000 lambs a year . He also had to pay him with the wool of 100,000 rams a year .
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	5	After Ahab died , Moab ’ s king refused to obey the next king of Israel .
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	6	So at that time King Joram started out from Samaria . He gathered together all of Israel ’ s troops .
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	7	He also sent a message to Jehoshaphat , the king of Judah . Joram said , “ The king of Moab is refusing to obey me . Will you go with me to fight against Moab ? ” “ Yes . I ’ ll go with you , ” Jehoshaphat replied . “ My men will go with you . My horses will also go with you. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	8	“ What road should we take to attack Moab ? ” Joram asked . “ The one that goes through the Desert of Edom , ” Jehoshaphat answered .
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	9	So the king of Israel marched out . The king of Judah and the king of Edom went with him . Their armies marched around the southern end of the Dead Sea . After seven days they ran out of water . There wasn ’ t any water for the men or their animals .
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	10	“ What should we do now ? ” exclaimed the king of Israel . “ The Lord has called us three kings together . Did he do it only to hand us over to Moab ? ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	11	But Jehoshaphat asked , “ Isn ’ t there a prophet of the Lord here ? Can ’ t we ask the Lord for advice through him ? ” An officer of the king of Israel answered , “ Elisha is here . He ’ s the son of Shaphat . Elisha used to serve Elijah. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	13	Elisha said to the king of Israel , “ Why do you want to come to me ? Go to your father ’ s prophets . Go to your mother ’ s prophets. ” “ No , ” the king of Israel answered . “ The Lord called us three kings together . He did it to hand us over to Moab. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	14	Elisha said , “ I serve the Lord who rules over all . You can be sure that he lives . And you can be just as sure that I have respect for Jehoshaphat , the king of Judah . If I didn ’ t , I wouldn ’ t pay any attention to you .
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	15	But now bring me someone who plays the harp. ” While that person was playing the harp , the Lord ’ s power came on Elisha .
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	16	Elisha announced , “ The Lord says , ‘ I will fill this valley with pools of water. ’
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	17	This will happen because the Lord says , ‘ You will not see wind or rain . But this valley will be filled with water . Then you , your cattle and your other animals will have water to drink. ’
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	18	This is an easy thing for the Lord to do . He will also hand Moab over to you .
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	19	You will destroy every city that has high walls around it . You will destroy every major town . You will cut down every good tree . You will stop up all the springs of water . And you will cover every good field with stones. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	20	The next day , the time came to offer the morning sacrifice . And then it happened ! Water was flowing from the direction of Edom ! In fact , the land was filled with water !
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	21	Now all the people of Moab had heard that the kings had come to fight against them . So the king of Moab sent for all Moab ’ s fighting men . It didn ’ t matter whether they were young or old . He sent for everyone who could carry a weapon . All of them were stationed at the border .
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	22	They got up early in the morning . The sun was already shining on the water . Across the way , the water looked red to the men of Moab . It looked like blood .
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	23	“ That ’ s blood ! ” they said . “ Those kings must have fought and killed each other . Let ’ s go , Moab ! Let ’ s take everything that has any value. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	24	So the men of Moab went to the camp of Israel . Just as they arrived there , the men of Israel got ready to fight . They fought against the men of Moab until those men ran away . The men of Israel marched into the land and attacked it . They killed the people of Moab .
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	25	They destroyed the towns . Each man threw a large stone on every good field . They did that until the fields were covered . They stopped up all the springs of water . And they cut down every good tree . The only town left with any stones in place was Kir Hareseth . But some of the Israelites armed with slings surrounded it . Then they attacked it .
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	26	The king of Moab saw that the battle had gone against him . So he took with him
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	700	men who had swords . They tried to break through the battle lines to the king of Edom . But they couldn ’ t do it .
NIRV	2%20Kings	3	27	Then the king of Moab took his oldest son . He was the son who would become the next king of Moab . But the king offered his son as a sacrifice on the city wall . That shocked and terrified the men of Israel . So they pulled back and returned to their own land . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Kings	4	2	Elisha replied to her , “ How can I help you ? Tell me . What do you have in your house ? ” “ I don ’ t have anything there at all , ” she said . “ All I have is a small jar of olive oil. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	4	Then go inside your house . Shut the door behind you and your sons . Pour oil into all the jars . As each jar is filled , put it over to one side. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	3	Elisha said , “ Go around to all your neighbors . Ask them for empty jars . Get as many as you can .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	5	The woman left him . Then she shut the door behind her and her sons . They brought the jars to her . And she kept pouring .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	6	When all the jars were full , she spoke to one of her sons . She said , “ Bring me another jar. ” But he replied , “ There aren ’ t any more left. ” Then the oil stopped flowing .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	7	She went and told the man of God about it . He said , “ Go and sell the oil . Pay what you owe . You and your sons can live on what is left. ” The Son of a Woman From Shunem Is Brought Back to Life
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	8	One day Elisha went to the town of Shunem . A rich woman lived there . She begged him to stay and have a meal . So every time he came by , he stopped there to eat .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	9	The woman said to her husband , “ That man often comes by here . I know that he is a holy man of God .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	10	Let ’ s make a small room for him on the roof . We ’ ll put a bed and a table in it . We ’ ll also put a chair and a lamp in it . Then he can stay there when he comes to visit us. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	11	One day Elisha came . He went up to his room and lay down there .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	12	He said to his servant Gehazi , “ Go and get the woman from Shunem. ” So he did . She stood in front of Elisha .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	13	He said to Gehazi , “ Tell her , ‘ You have gone to a lot of trouble for us . Now what can we do for you ? Can we speak to the king for you ? Or can we speak to the commander of the army for you ? ’ ” She replied , “ I live among my own people . I have everything I need here. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	14	After she left , Elisha asked Gehazi , “ What can we do for her ? ” Gehazi said , “ She doesn ’ t have a son . And her husband is old. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	15	Then Elisha said , “ Bring her here again. ” So he did . She stood in the doorway .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	16	“ You will hold a son in your arms , ” Elisha said . “ It will be about this time next year. ” “ No , my master ! ” she objected . “ You are a man of God . So please don ’ t lie to me ! ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	17	But the woman became pregnant . She had a baby boy . It happened the next year about that same time . That ’ s exactly what Elisha had told her would happen .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	18	The child grew . One day he went out to get his father . His father was with the people who were gathering the crops .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	19	The boy said to his father , “ My head hurts ! It really hurts ! ” His father told a servant , “ Carry him to his mother. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	20	loaves of barley bread . They had been baked from the first grain that had ripened . The man also brought some heads of new grain . “ Give this food to the people to eat , ” Elisha said .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	21	She went up to the room on the roof . There she laid him on the bed of the man of God . Then she shut the door and went out .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	22	She sent for her husband . She said , “ Please send me one of the servants and a donkey . Then I can go quickly to the man of God and return. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	23	“ Why do you want to go to him today ? ” he asked . “ It isn ’ t the time for the New Moon feast . It isn ’ t the Sabbath day. ” “ Don ’ t let that bother you , ” she said .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	24	She put a saddle on her donkey . She said to her servant , “ Let ’ s go . Don ’ t slow down for me unless I tell you to. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	25	So she started out . She came to Mount Carmel . That ’ s where the man of God was . When she was still a long way off , he saw her coming . He said to his servant Gehazi , “ Look ! There ’ s the woman from Shunem !
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	26	Run out there to meet her . Ask her , ‘ Are you all right ? Is your husband all right ? Is your child all right ? ’ ” “ Everything is all right , ” she said .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	27	She came to the man of God at the mountain . Then she took hold of his feet . Gehazi came over to push her away . But the man of God said , “ Leave her alone ! She is suffering terribly . But the Lord hasn ’ t told me the reason for it . He has hidden it from me. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	28	“ My master , did I ask you for a son ? ” she said . “ Didn ’ t I tell you , ‘ Don ’ t make me hope for something that won ’ t happen ’ ? ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	29	Elisha said to Gehazi , “ Tuck your coat into your belt . Take my walking stick and run to Shunem . Don ’ t say hello to anyone you see . If anyone says hello to you , don ’ t answer . Lay my walking stick on the boy ’ s face. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	30	But the child ’ s mother said , “ I won ’ t leave you . And that ’ s just as sure as the Lord and you are alive. ” So Elisha got up and followed her .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	31	Gehazi went on ahead . He laid Elisha ’ s walking stick on the boy ’ s face . But there wasn ’ t any sound . The boy didn ’ t move at all . So Gehazi went back to Elisha . He told him , “ The boy hasn ’ t awakened. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	32	Elisha arrived at the house . The boy was dead . He was lying on Elisha ’ s bed .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	33	Elisha went into the room . He shut the door . He was alone with the boy . He prayed to the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	34	Then Elisha got on the bed . He lay down on the boy . His mouth touched the boy ’ s mouth . His eyes touched the boy ’ s eyes . And his hands touched the boy ’ s hands . As Elisha lay on the boy , the boy ’ s body grew warm .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	35	Elisha turned away . He walked back and forth in the room . Then he got on the bed again . He lay down on the boy once more . The boy sneezed seven times . After that , he opened his eyes .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	36	Elisha sent for Gehazi . He said to him , “ Go and get the woman from Shunem. ” So he did . When she came , Elisha said , “ Take your son. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	37	She came in and fell at Elisha ’ s feet . She bowed down with her face toward the ground . Then she took her son and went out . Deadly Food in a Pot
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	38	Elisha returned to Gilgal . There wasn ’ t enough food to eat in that area . The group of the prophets was meeting with Elisha . So he said to his servant , “ Put the large pot over the fire . Cook some stew for these prophets. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	39	One of them went out into the fields to gather herbs . He found a wild vine and picked some of its gourds . He picked as many as he could fit in his coat . Then he cut them up and put them into the pot of stew . But no one knew what they were .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	40	The stew was poured out for the men . They began to eat it . But then they cried out , “ Man of God , the food in that pot will kill us ! ” They couldn ’ t eat it .
NIRV	2%20Kings	4	41	Elisha said , “ Get some flour. ” He put it in the pot . He said , “ Serve it to the men to eat. ” Then there wasn ’ t anything in the pot that could harm them . Elisha Feeds

NIRV	2%20Kings	5	2	Groups of soldiers from Aram had marched out . They had captured a young girl from Israel . She became a servant of Naaman ’ s wife .
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	5	“ I think you should go , ” the king of Aram replied . “ I ’ ll give you a letter to take to the king of Israel. ” So Naaman left . He took
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	3	The young girl spoke to the woman she was serving . She said , “ I wish my master would go and see the prophet who is in Samaria . He would heal my master of his skin disease. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	4	Naaman went to see his own master . He told him what the girl from Israel had said .
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	750	pounds of silver with him . He also took
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	150	pounds of silver in two bags . He also gave Gehazi two sets of clothes . He gave all of it to two of his own servants . They carried it ahead of Gehazi .
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	6	He carried the letter to the king of Israel . It said , “ I ’ m sending my servant Naaman to you with this letter . I want you to heal him of his skin disease. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	7	The king of Israel read the letter . As soon as he did , he tore his royal robes . He said , “ Am I God ? Can I kill people and bring them back to life ? Why does this fellow send someone to me to be healed of his skin disease ? He must be trying to pick a fight with me ! ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	8	Elisha , the man of God , heard that the king of Israel had torn his robes . So he sent the king a message . Elisha said , “ Why have you torn your robes ? Tell the man to come to me . Then he will know there is a prophet in Israel. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	9	So Naaman went to see Elisha . He took his horses and chariots with him . He stopped at the door of Elisha ’ s house .
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	10	Elisha sent a messenger out to him . The messenger said , “ Go ! Wash yourself in the Jordan River seven times . Then your skin will be healed . You will be pure and ‘ clean ’ again. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	11	But Naaman went away angry . He said , “ I was sure Elisha would come out to me . I thought he would stand there and pray to the Lord his God . I thought he would wave his hand over my skin . Then I would be healed .
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	12	And what about the Abana and Pharpar rivers of Damascus ? Aren ’ t they better than all the rivers of Israel ? Couldn ’ t I wash in the rivers of Damascus and be made pure and ‘ clean ’ ? ” So he turned and went away . He was very angry .
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	13	Naaman ’ s servants went over to him . They said , “ You are like a father to us . What if Elisha the prophet had told you to do some great thing ? Wouldn ’ t you have done it ? But he only said , ‘ Wash yourself . Then you will be pure and “ clean. ” ’ You should be even more willing to do that ! ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	14	So Naaman went down to the Jordan River . He dipped himself in it seven times . He did exactly what the man of God had told him to do . Then his skin was made pure again . It became “ clean ” like the skin of a young boy .
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	15	Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God . Naaman stood in front of Elisha . Naaman said , “ Now I know that there is no God anywhere in the whole world except in Israel . So please accept a gift from me. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	16	The prophet answered , “ I serve the Lord . You can be sure that he lives . And you can be just as sure that I won ’ t accept a gift from you. ” Even though Naaman begged him to take it , Elisha wouldn ’ t .
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	17	“ I can see that you won ’ t accept a gift from me , ” said Naaman . “ But please let me have some soil from your land . Give me as much as a pair of mules can carry . Here ’ s why I want it . I won ’ t ever bring burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other god again . I ’ ll bring them only to the Lord . I ’ ll worship him on his own soil .
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	18	But there is one thing I hope the Lord will forgive me for . From time to time my master will enter the temple to bow down to his god Rimmon . When he does , he ’ ll lean on my arm . Then I ’ ll have to bow down there also . I hope the Lord will forgive me for that. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	19	“ Go in peace , ” Elisha said . Naaman started out on his way .
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	20	Gehazi was the servant of Elisha , the man of God . Gehazi said to himself , “ My master was too easy on Naaman from Aram . He should have accepted the gift Naaman brought . I ’ m going to run after him . I ’ m going to get something from him . And that ’ s just as sure as the Lord is alive. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	21	Gehazi hurried after Naaman . Naaman saw him running toward him . So he got down from the chariot to greet him . “ Is everything all right ? ” he asked .
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	22	“ Everything is all right , ” Gehazi answered . “ My master sent me to say , ‘ Two young men from the group of the prophets have just come to me . They ’ ve come from the hill country of Ephraim . Please give them
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	75	pounds of silver and two sets of clothes. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	23	“ I wish you would take twice as much silver , ” said Naaman . He begged Gehazi to accept it . Then Naaman tied up
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	24	Gehazi came to the hill where Elisha lived . Then the servants handed the things over to Gehazi . He put them away in Elisha ’ s house . He sent the men away , and they left .
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	25	Then he went back inside the house . He stood in front of his master Elisha . “ Gehazi , where have you been ? ” Elisha asked . “ I didn ’ t go anywhere , ” Gehazi answered .
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	26	But Elisha said to him , “ Didn ’ t my spirit go with you ? I know that the man got down from his chariot to greet you . Is this the time for you to accept money or clothes ? Is it the time to take olive groves , vineyards , flocks or herds ? Is it the time to accept male and female slaves ?
NIRV	2%20Kings	5	27	You and your children after you will have Naaman ’ s skin disease forever. ” Then Gehazi left Elisha . And he had Naaman ’ s skin disease . His skin had become as white as snow . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Kings	6	2	We would like to go to the Jordan River . Each of us can get some wood there . We want to build a place there for us to meet. ” Elisha said , “ Go. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	6	The man of God asked , “ Where did the blade fall ? ” He showed Elisha the place . Then Elisha cut a stick and threw it there . That made the iron blade float .
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	3	Then one of them said , “ Won ’ t you please come with us ? ” “ I will , ” Elisha replied .
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	4	And he went with them . They went to the Jordan River . There they began to cut down trees .
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	5	One of them was cutting down a tree . The iron blade of his ax fell into the water . “ Oh no , master ! ” he cried out . “ This ax was borrowed ! ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	7	“ Take it out of the water , ” he said . So the man reached out and took it . Elisha Makes the Soldiers of Aram Blind
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	8	The king of Aram was at war with Israel . He talked things over with his officers . Then he said , “ I ’ m going to set up my camp in a certain place. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	9	Elisha , the man of God , sent a message to the king of Israel . Elisha said , “ Try to stay away from that place . Aram ’ s army is going to be down there. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	10	The king of Israel checked on the place the man of God had told him about . Time after time Elisha warned the king . So the king was on guard in those places .
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	11	All of that made the king of Aram very angry . He sent for his officers . He said to them , “ Tell me ! Which of us is on the side of the king of Israel ? ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	12	“ You are my king and master , ” said one of his officers . “ None of us is on Israel ’ s side . But Elisha is a prophet in Israel . He tells the king of Israel even the words you speak in your own bedroom. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	13	“ Go and find out where he is , ” the king ordered . “ Then I can send my men and capture him. ” The report came back . The officers said , “ He ’ s in Dothan. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	14	Then the king sent horses and chariots and a strong army there . They went at night and surrounded the city .
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	15	The servant of the man of God got up the next morning . He went out early . He saw that an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city . “ Oh no , my master ! ” the servant said . “ What can we do ? ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	16	“ Don ’ t be afraid , ” the prophet answered . “ Those who are with us are more than those who are with them. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	17	Elisha prayed , “ Lord , open my servant ’ s eyes so that he can see. ” Then the Lord opened his eyes . Elisha ’ s servant looked up and saw the hills . He saw that Elisha was surrounded by horses and chariots made of fire .
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	18	Aram ’ s army came down toward Elisha . Then he prayed to the Lord , “ Make these soldiers blind. ” So the Lord made them blind , just as Elisha had prayed .
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	19	Elisha told them , “ This isn ’ t the right road . This isn ’ t the right city . Follow me . I ’ ll lead you to the man you are looking for. ” He led them to Samaria .
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	20	They entered the city . Then Elisha said , “ Lord , open the eyes of these men . Help them see again. ” Then the Lord opened their eyes . They looked around . And there they were , inside Samaria !
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	21	The king of Israel saw them . So he asked Elisha , “ Should I kill them ? I need your advice . You are like a father to me . Should I kill them ? ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	22	“ Don ’ t kill them , ” he answered . “ Would you kill people you have captured with your own sword or bow ? Put some food and water in front of them . Then they can eat and drink . They can go back to their master. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	23	So the king of Israel prepared a great feast for them . After they had finished eating and drinking , he sent them away . They returned to their master . So the groups of fighting men from Aram stopped attacking Israel ’ s territory . Aram ’ s Army Attacks Samaria and People Go Hungry
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	24	Some time later , Ben-Hadad gathered his entire army together . Ben-Hadad was the king of Aram . His army marched up and surrounded Samaria . Then they attacked it .
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	25	There wasn ’ t enough food anywhere in the city . It was surrounded for so long that people had to weigh out two pounds of silver for a donkey ’ s head . They had to weigh out two ounces of silver for half a pint of seed pods .
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	26	One day the king of Israel was walking on top of the city wall . A woman cried out to him , “ You are my king and master . Please help me ! ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	27	The king replied , “ If the Lord doesn ’ t help you , where can I get help for you ? From the threshing floor ? From the winepress ? ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	28	He continued , “ What ’ s wrong ? ” She answered , “ A woman said to me , ‘ Give up your son . Then we can eat him today . Tomorrow we ’ ll eat my son. ’
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	29	So we cooked my son . Then we ate him . The next day I said to her , ‘ Give up your son . Then we can eat him. ’ But she had hidden him. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	30	When the king heard the woman ’ s words , he tore his royal robes . As he walked along the wall , the people looked up at him . They saw that under his robes he was wearing the rough clothing people wear when they ’ re sad .
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	31	He said , “ I ’ ll cut the head of Shaphat ’ s son Elisha off his shoulders today . If I don ’ t , may God punish me greatly ! ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	32	Elisha was sitting in his house . The elders were sitting there with him . The king went to see Elisha . He sent a messenger on ahead of him . Before the messenger arrived , Elisha spoke to the elders . He said , “ That murderer is sending someone here to cut off my head . Can ’ t you see that ? When the messenger comes , close the door . Hold it shut against him . Can ’ t you hear his master ’ s footsteps right behind him ? ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	6	33	Elisha was still talking to the elders when the messenger came down to him . The king also arrived . He said , “ The Lord has sent this horrible trouble on us . Why should I wait any longer for him to help us ? ” Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Kings	7	2	The king was leaning on an officer ’ s arm . The officer spoke to the man of God . The officer said , “ Suppose the Lord opens the sky and pours down food on us . Even if he does , could what you are saying really happen ? ” “ You will see it with your own eyes , ” answered Elisha . “ But you won ’ t eat any of it ! ” The Attack on Samaria Ends
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	7	So the soldiers of Aram had run away at sunset . They had left their tents and horses and donkeys behind . They had left the camp just as it was . And they had run for their lives .
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	12	pounds of the finest flour will cost less than half of an ounce of silver . You will also be able to buy
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	20	And that ’ s exactly what happened to the officer . On their way out of the city , the people knocked him down . In the entrance of the gate he was crushed as they walked on top of him . And so he died . Copyright ©
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	3	There were four men who had a skin disease . They were at the entrance of the gate of Samaria . They said to one another , “ Why should we stay here until we die ?
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	4	Suppose we say , ‘ We ’ ll go into the city. ’ There isn ’ t any food there , and we ’ ll die . But if we stay here , we ’ ll die anyway . So let ’ s go over to Aram ’ s army camp . Let ’ s give ourselves up . If they spare us , we ’ ll live . If they kill us , we ’ ll die. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	5	At sunset they got up and went to Aram ’ s army camp . They arrived at the edge of it . But no one was there .
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	6	The Lord had caused the soldiers of Aram to hear a noise . It sounded like chariots and horses and a huge army . So the soldiers said to one another , “ Listen ! The king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings . He has paid them to attack us ! ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	8	The men who had a skin disease arrived at the edge of the camp . They entered one of the tents . They ate and drank . Then they took silver , gold and clothes . They went off and hid them . They returned and entered another tent . They took some things from it and hid them also .
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	9	But then they said to one another , “ What we ’ re doing isn ’ t right . This is a day of good news . And we ’ re keeping it to ourselves . If we wait until sunrise , we ’ ll be punished . Let ’ s go at once . Let ’ s report this to the royal palace. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	10	So they went . They called out to the people who were guarding the city gates . They told them , “ We went into Aram ’ s army camp . No one was there . We didn ’ t hear anyone . The horses and donkeys were still tied up . The tents were left just as they were. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	11	The people who guarded the gates shouted the news . It was reported inside the palace .
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	13	One of the king ’ s officers said , “ A few horses are still left in the city . Have some men get five of them . Those men won ’ t be any worse off than all the other Israelites who are left here . In fact , all of us will soon be dead anyway . So let ’ s send the men to find out what happened. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	14	The men chose two chariots and their horses . The king sent them out to look for Aram ’ s army . He commanded the drivers , “ Go and find out what has happened. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	15	They followed the trail of Aram ’ s soldiers all the way to the Jordan River . They found clothes and supplies all along the road . The soldiers had thrown them down when they ran away . So the men who were sent out returned . They reported to the king what they had seen .
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	16	Then the people went out of the city . They took everything of value from Aram ’ s army camp . So
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	17	The king had put an officer in charge of the city gate . He was the officer on whose arm the king leaned . On their way out of the city , the people knocked the officer down . In the entrance of the gate he was crushed as they walked on top of him . And so he died . That ’ s exactly what the man of God had said would happen . He had said it when the king came down to his house .
NIRV	2%20Kings	7	18	What Elisha , the man of God , had told the king came true . Elisha had said , “ About this time tomorrow , flour won ’ t cost very much . Even

NIRV	2%20Kings	8	2	The woman did just as the man of God told her to . She and her family went away . They stayed in the land of the Philistines for seven years .
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	8	Then the king said to Hazael , “ Take a gift with you . Go and see the man of God . Ask him for the Lord ’ s advice . Ask him whether I will get well again. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	3	The seven years passed . Then she came back from the land of the Philistines . She went to the king of Israel . She wanted to ask him to get her house and land back .
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	4	The king was talking to Gehazi . Gehazi was the servant of the man of God . The king had said , “ Tell me about all the great things Elisha has done. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	5	Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought a dead boy back to life . Just then the woman came to ask the king to get her house and land back . She was the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life . Gehazi said , “ King Joram , this is the woman I ’ ve been telling you about . And this is her son . He ’ s the one Elisha brought back to life. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	6	The king asked the woman about her house and land . And she told him . Then he appointed an official to look into her case . The king told him , “ Give her back everything that belonged to her . That includes all the money that was earned from her land . It was earned from the day she left the country until now. ” Hazael Murders Ben-Hadad
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	7	Elisha went to Damascus . Ben-Hadad was sick . He was king of Aram . The king was told , “ The man of God has come all the way up here. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	9	Hazael went to see Elisha . Hazael took
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	40	camels with him as a gift . The camels were loaded with all the finest goods of Damascus . Hazael went into Elisha ’ s house and stood in front of him . Hazael said , “ Ben-Hadad has sent me . He is the king of Aram . He asks , ‘ Will I get well again ? ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	10	Elisha answered , “ Go and tell him , ‘ Yes . You will get well again. ’ But the Lord has shown me that he will in fact die. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	11	Elisha stared at him without looking away . He did it until Hazael felt uncomfortable . Then the man of God began to weep .
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	12	“ Why are you weeping ? ” asked Hazael . “ Because I know how much harm you will do to the people of Israel , ” Elisha answered . “ You will set fire to their cities that have high walls around them . You will kill their young men with your swords . You will smash their little children on the ground . You will rip open their pregnant women. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	13	Hazael said , “ How could I possibly do a thing like that ? I ’ m nothing but a dog . I don ’ t have that kind of power. ” “ You will become king of Aram , ” Elisha answered . “ That ’ s what the Lord has shown me. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	14	Then Hazael left Elisha and returned to his master . Ben-Hadad asked , “ What did Elisha say to you ? ” Hazael replied , “ He told me you would get well again. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	15	But the next day Hazael got a thick cloth . He soaked it in water . He spread it over the king ’ s face . He held it there until the king died . Then Hazael became the next king after him . Jehoram King of Judah
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	16	Jehoram began to rule as king over Judah . It was in the fifth year that Joram was king of Israel . Joram was the son of Ahab . Jehoram was the son of Jehoshaphat .
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	17	Jehoram was
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	32	years old when he became king . He ruled in Jerusalem for eight years .
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	18	He followed the ways of the kings of Israel , just as the royal family of Ahab had done . In fact , he married a daughter of Ahab . Jehoram did what was evil in the sight of the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	19	But the Lord didn ’ t want to destroy Judah . That ’ s because the Lord had made a covenant with his servant David . The Lord had promised to keep the lamp of David ’ s kingdom burning brightly . The Lord had promised that for him and his children after him forever .
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	20	When Jehoram was king over Judah , Edom refused to remain under Judah ’ s control . Edom set up their own king .
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	21	So Jehoram went to Zair . He took all his chariots with him . The men of Edom surrounded him and his chariot commanders . He got up at night and fought his way out . But his army ran back home .
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	22	years old when he became king . He ruled in Jerusalem for one year . His mother ’ s name was Athaliah . She was a granddaughter of Omri . Omri had been the king of Israel .
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	23	The other events of Jehoram ’ s rule are written down . Everything he did is written in the official records of the kings of Judah .
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	24	Jehoram joined the members of his family who had already died . He was buried in the family tomb in the City of David . Jehoram ’ s son Ahaziah became the next king after him . Ahaziah King of Judah
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	25	Ahaziah began to rule as king over Judah . It was in the 12th year that Joram was king of Israel . Joram was the son of Ahab . Ahaziah was the son of Jehoram .
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	26	Ahaziah was
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	27	Ahaziah followed the ways of the royal family of Ahab . Ahaziah did what was evil in the sight of the Lord , just as the family of Ahab had done . That ’ s because he had married into Ahab ’ s family .
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	28	Ahaziah joined forces with Joram . They went to war against Hazael at Ramoth Gilead . Joram was the son of Ahab . Hazael was king of Aram . The soldiers of Aram wounded King Joram .
NIRV	2%20Kings	8	29	So he returned to Jezreel to give his wounds time to heal . The soldiers of Aram had wounded him at Ramoth in his battle against Hazael , the king of Aram . Ahaziah , the son of Jehoram , went down to Jezreel . He went there to see Joram . That ’ s because Joram had been wounded . Ahaziah was king of Judah . Joram was the son of Ahab . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Kings	9	9	I will make Ahab ’ s royal house like the house of Jeroboam , the son of Nebat . I will make it like the house of Baasha , the son of Ahijah .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	3	Then get the bottle . Pour the oil on his head . Announce to him , ‘ The Lord says , “ I anoint you as king over Israel. ” ’ After that , open the door and run away . Do it quickly ! ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	4	So the young prophet went to Ramoth Gilead .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	5	When he arrived , he found the army officers sitting together . “ Commander , I have a message for you , ” he said . “ For which one of us ? ” asked Jehu . “ For you , commander , ” he replied .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	6	Jehu got up and went into the house . Then the prophet poured the oil on Jehu ’ s head . He announced , “ The Lord is the God of Israel . He says , ‘ I am anointing you as king over the Lord ’ s people Israel .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	7	You must destroy the royal house of your master Ahab . I will pay them back for spilling the blood of my servants the prophets . I will also pay them back for the blood of all the Lord ’ s servants that Jezebel spilled .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	8	The whole house of Ahab will die out . I will destroy every male in Israel who is related to Ahab . It does not matter whether they are slaves or free .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	10	Dogs will eat up Jezebel on a piece of land at Jezreel . No one will bury her. ’ ” Then the prophet opened the door and ran away .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	11	Jehu went out to where the other officers were . One of them asked him , “ Is everything all right ? Why did that crazy man come to you ? ” “ You know the man . You know the kinds of things he says , ” Jehu replied .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	12	“ That ’ s not true ! ” they said . “ Tell us. ” Jehu said , “ Here is what he told me . He announced , ‘ The Lord says , “ I am anointing you as king over Israel. ” ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	13	The officers quickly grabbed their coats . They spread them out under Jehu on the bare steps of the house . Then they blew a trumpet . They shouted , “ Jehu is king ! ” Jehu Kills Joram and Ahaziah
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	14	Jehu was the son of Jehoshaphat , the son of Nimshi . Jehu made plans against Joram . During that time Joram and Israel ’ s whole army had been guarding Ramoth Gilead . They had been guarding it against Hazael , the king of Aram .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	15	But King Joram had returned to Jezreel . He had gone there to give his wounds time to heal . The soldiers of Aram had wounded him in his battle against Hazael , the king of Aram . Jehu said to his men , “ Do you want to make me king ? If you do , don ’ t let anyone sneak out of the city . Don ’ t let them go and tell the news in Jezreel. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	16	Then Jehu got into his chariot . He rode off to Jezreel . Joram was resting there . And Ahaziah , the king of Judah , had gone down to see him .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	17	A lookout was standing on the roof of the tower in Jezreel . He saw Jehu ’ s troops approaching . So he called out , “ I see some troops coming. ” “ Get a horseman , ” Joram ordered . “ Send him to ride out to them . Have him ask , ‘ Are you coming in peace ? ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	18	The horseman rode out to where Jehu was . He said , “ The king asks , ‘ Are you coming in peace ? ’ ” “ What do you know about peace ? ” Jehu answered . “ Get in line behind me. ” The lookout reported , “ The messenger has reached them . But he isn ’ t coming back. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	19	So the king sent out a second horseman . When he came to them , he said , “ The king asks , ‘ Are you coming in peace ? ’ ” Jehu replied , “ What do you know about peace ? Get in line behind me. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	20	The lookout reported , “ The second messenger has reached them . But he isn ’ t coming back either . The one driving the chariot drives like Jehu , the son of Nimshi . He ’ s driving like a crazy person. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	21	“ Get my chariot ready , ” King Joram ordered . When it was ready , he rode out . Ahaziah , the king of Judah , rode out with him . Each of them was in his own chariot . They both went to meet Jehu . They met him at the piece of land that had belonged to Naboth from Jezreel .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	22	When Joram saw Jehu he asked , “ Have you come here in peace , Jehu ? ” “ Your mother Jezebel worships statues of gods , ” Jehu replied . “ She also worships evil powers . The evil things she does have spread everywhere . As long as all of that goes on , how can there be peace ? ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	23	Joram turned around and tried to get away . He called out , “ It ’ s treason , Ahaziah ! ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	24	Then Jehu shot an arrow at Joram . It hit him between the shoulders . It went through his heart . He sank down slowly in his chariot .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	25	Jehu spoke to Bidkar , his chariot officer . Jehu said , “ Pick Joram up . Throw him on the field that belonged to Naboth from Jezreel . Remember how you and I were riding together in chariots behind Joram ’ s father Ahab ? It was when the Lord spoke this prophecy against him . The Lord announced ,
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	26	‘ Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons . You can be sure that I will make you pay for it on this piece of land. ’ So pick Joram up . Throw him on that piece of land . That ’ s what the Lord said would happen. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	27	Ahaziah , the king of Judah , saw what had happened . So he tried to get away . He went up the road toward Beth Haggan . Jehu chased him . He shouted , “ Kill him too ! ” Jehu ’ s men wounded Ahaziah in his chariot . It happened on the way up to Gur near Ibleam . But Ahaziah escaped to Megiddo . And that ’ s where he died .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	28	Ahaziah ’ s servants took him to Jerusalem in his chariot . They buried him in his family tomb in the City of David .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	29	Ahaziah had become king of Judah . It was in the 11th year of Joram , the son of Ahab . Jehu Kills Jezebel
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	30	Jehu went to Jezreel . Jezebel heard about it . So she put makeup on her eyes and fixed her hair . Then she looked out of a window .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	31	Jehu entered the gate below . Jezebel said to him , “ You are just like Zimri . You murdered your master . Have you come here in peace ? ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	32	Jehu looked up at the window . “ Who is on my side ? ” he called out . “ Who ? ” Two or three officials looked down at him .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	33	“ Throw her down ! ” Jehu said . So they threw her down . Some of her blood splashed on the wall . Some of it splashed on Jehu ’ s chariot horses as they ran over her .
NIRV	2%20Kings	9	34	Jehu went inside . He ate and drank . “ The Lord put a curse on that woman , ” he said . “ Take proper care of her body . Bury her . After all , she was a king ’ s daughter. ”

NIRV	2%20Kings	10	10	I want you to know that the Lord has spoken against Ahab ’ s royal house . Not a word of what he has said will fail . The Lord has done exactly what he announced through his servant Elijah. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	70	of them . They put their heads in baskets . Then they sent them to Jehu in Jezreel .
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	3	Choose the best and most respected son of your master . Place him on his father Joram ’ s throne . Then fight for your master ’ s royal house. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	4	The leaders of Samaria were terrified . They said , “ King Joram and King Ahaziah couldn ’ t stand up against Jehu . So how can we ? ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	5	The city governor and the person in charge of the palace sent a message to Jehu . The message was also from the elders and the people who took care of Ahab ’ s children . In the message , they said , “ We will serve you . We ’ ll do anything you say . We won ’ t appoint anyone to be king . Do what you think is best. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	6	Then Jehu wrote them a second letter . He said , “ You say you are on my side . You say you will obey me . If you really mean it , bring me the heads of your master ’ s sons . Meet me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow. ” There were
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	7	When Jehu ’ s letter arrived , the men went and got the princes . They killed all
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	8	When the messenger arrived , he spoke to Jehu . He told him , “ The heads of the princes have been brought here. ” Then Jehu ordered his men , “ Put them in two piles . Stack them up at the entrance of the city gate until morning. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	9	The next morning Jehu went out . He stood in front of all the people . He said , “ You aren ’ t guilty of doing anything wrong . I ’ m the one who made plans against my master Joram . I killed him . But who killed all these ?
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	11	So Jehu killed everyone from Ahab ’ s family who was in Jezreel . He also killed all Ahab ’ s chief men . And he killed Ahab ’ s close friends and his priests . He didn ’ t leave anyone alive in Ahab ’ s family .
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	12	Then Jehu started out for Samaria . At Beth Eked of the Shepherds ,
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	13	he saw some people . They were relatives of Ahaziah , the king of Judah . Jehu asked them , “ Who are you ? ” They said , “ We are Ahaziah ’ s relatives . We ’ ve come down to visit the families of the king and of his mother. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	14	“ Take them alive ! ” Jehu ordered . So his men took them alive . Then they killed them by the well of Beth Eked . They killed a total of
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	42	of them . Jehu didn ’ t leave anyone alive .
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	15	Jehu left there . On the way he met Jehonadab . He was the son of Rekab . Jehonadab was on his way to see Jehu . Jehu greeted him . He asked , “ Are you my friend ? You know I ’ m your friend. ” “ I am , ” Jehonadab answered . “ If that ’ s true , ” said Jehu , “ hold out your hand. ” So he did . Then Jehu helped him up into the chariot .
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	16	Jehu said , “ Come along with me . See how committed I am to serve the Lord. ” Jehu had Jehonadab ride along in his chariot .
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	17	Jehu came to Samaria . He killed everyone there who was left from Ahab ’ s family . And so he completely destroyed Ahab ’ s royal house . That ’ s what the Lord had said would happen . He had spoken that message to Elijah . Jehu Kills the People Who Serve Baal
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	18	Then Jehu brought together all the people . He said to them , “ Ahab served the god named Baal a little . I will serve him a lot .
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	19	Send for all of Baal ’ s prophets . Also send for all his priests and the others who serve him . Make sure that not a single one is missing . I ’ m going to hold a great sacrifice to honor Baal . Anyone who doesn ’ t come will be killed. ” But Jehu was lying to them . He was planning to destroy everyone who served Baal .
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	20	Jehu said , “ Call everyone together to honor Baal. ” So they did .
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	21	Then he sent a message all through Israel . All those who served Baal came . Not a single one of them stayed away . They crowded into Baal ’ s temple . It was full from one end to the other .
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	22	Jehu spoke to the one who took care of the sacred robes . He told him , “ Bring robes for everyone who serves Baal. ” So he brought the robes out for them .
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	23	Then Jehu went into Baal ’ s temple . Jehonadab , the son of Rekab , went with him . Jehu said to those who served Baal , “ Look around . Make sure that no one who serves the Lord is here with you . Make sure only those who serve Baal are here. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	24	So they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings . Jehu had stationed
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	80	men outside . He warned them , “ I ’ m placing some men in your hands . Don ’ t let a single one of them escape . If you do , you will pay for his life with yours. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	25	Jehu finished sacrificing the burnt offering . As soon as he did , he gave an order to the guards and officers . He commanded them , “ Go inside and kill everyone . Don ’ t let a single one of them escape. ” So they cut them down with their swords . The guards and officers threw the bodies outside . Then they entered the most sacred area inside Baal ’ s temple .
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	26	They brought the sacred stone of Baal outside . They burned it up .
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	27	So they destroyed Baal ’ s sacred stone . They also tore down Baal ’ s temple . People have used it as a public toilet to this day .

NIRV	2%20Kings	10	29	But he didn ’ t turn away from the sins of Jeroboam , the son of Nebat . Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit those same sins . Jehu worshiped the golden calves at Bethel and Dan .
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	30	The Lord said to Jehu , “ You have done well . You have accomplished what is right in my eyes . You have done to Ahab ’ s royal house everything I wanted you to do . So your sons after you will sit on the throne of Israel . They will rule until the time of your children ’ s grandchildren. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	31	But Jehu wasn ’ t careful to obey the law of the Lord . He didn ’ t obey the God of Israel with all his heart . He didn ’ t turn away from the sins of Jeroboam . Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit those same sins .
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	32	In those days the Lord began to make the kingdom of Israel smaller . Hazael gained control over many parts of Israel . He gained control over all their territory
NIRV	2%20Kings	10	33	east of the Jordan River . It included the whole land of Gilead from Aroer by the Arnon River valley all the way to Bashan . That was the territory of Gad , Reuben and Manasseh .

NIRV	2%20Kings	11	2	But Jehosheba went and got Joash , the son of Ahaziah . Jehosheba was the daughter of King Jehoram and the sister of Ahaziah . She stole Joash away from among the royal princes . All of them were about to be murdered . She put Joash and his nurse in a bedroom . That ’ s how she hid him from Athaliah . And that ’ s why Athaliah didn ’ t kill him .
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	11	The guards stationed themselves around the new king . Each of them had his weapon in his hand . They were near the altar and the temple . They stood from the south side of the temple to its north side .
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	3	The child remained hidden with his nurse at the Lord ’ s temple for six years . Athaliah ruled over the land during that time .
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	4	In the seventh year Jehoiada the priest sent for the commanders of military groups of
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	100	men . They were the commanders over the Carites and the guards . He also took with him all the people of the land . All of them brought the new king down from the Lord ’ s temple . They went into the palace . They entered it by going through the gate of the guards . Then the king sat down on the royal throne .
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	5	He gave them a command . He said , “ Here ’ s what you must do . There are five groups of you . Some of you are in the three groups that are going on duty on the Sabbath day . A third of you must guard the royal palace .
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	6	A third of you must guard the Sur Gate . And a third of you must guard the gate that is behind the guard . All of you must take turns guarding the temple .
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	7	The rest of you are in the other two groups . Normally you are not on duty on the Sabbath day . But you also must guard the temple for the king .
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	8	Station yourselves around the king . Each of you must have his weapon in his hand . Anyone else who approaches your groups must be put to death . Stay close to the king no matter where he goes. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	9	The commanders of the military groups did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered . Each commander got his men and came to Jehoiada . Some of the men were going on duty on the Sabbath day . Others were going off duty .
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	10	Then Jehoiada gave weapons to the commanders . He gave them spears and shields . The weapons had belonged to King David . They had been in the Lord ’ s temple .
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	12	Jehoiada brought out Ahaziah ’ s son . He put the crown on him . He gave him a copy of the covenant . And he announced that Joash was king . Jehoiada and his sons anointed him . The people clapped their hands . Then they shouted , “ May the king live a long time ! ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	13	Athaliah heard the noise the guards and the people were making . So she went to the people at the Lord ’ s temple .
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	14	She looked , and there was the king ! He was standing next to the pillar . That was the usual practice . The officers and trumpet players were standing beside the king . All the people of the land were filled with joy . They were blowing trumpets . Then Athaliah tore her royal robes . She called out , “ Treason ! It ’ s treason ! ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	15	Jehoiada the priest gave an order to the commanders of the military groups of
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	16	So they grabbed her as she reached the place where the horses enter the palace grounds . There she was put to death .
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	17	Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the Lord and the king and people . He had the king and people promise that they would be the Lord ’ s people . Jehoiada also made a covenant between the king and the people .
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	18	All the people of the land went to Baal ’ s temple . They tore it down . They smashed to pieces the altars and the statues of gods . They killed Mattan in front of the altars . He was the priest of Baal . Then Jehoiada the priest stationed guards at the temple of the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	19	Jehoiada took with him the commanders of groups of
NIRV	2%20Kings	11	20	All the people of the land were filled with joy . And the city was calm . That ’ s because Athaliah had been killed with a sword at the palace .

NIRV	2%20Kings	12	2	Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord . Joash lived that way as long as Jehoiada the priest was teaching him .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	12	They paid those who cut stones and those who laid them . They bought lumber and blocks of stone . So they used the money to repair the Lord ’ s temple . They also paid all the other costs to make the temple like new again .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	40	years . His mother ’ s name was Zibiah . She was from Beersheba .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	3	But the high places weren ’ t removed . The people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	4	Joash spoke to the priests . He said , “ Collect all the money the people bring as sacred offerings to the Lord ’ s temple . That includes the money collected when the men who are able to serve in the army are counted . It includes the money received from people who make a special promise to the Lord . It also includes the money people bring to the temple just because they want to .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	5	Let each priest receive the money from one of the people in charge of the temple ’ s treasures . Then use all of that money to repair the temple where it needs it. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	6	It was now the 23rd year of the rule of King Joash . And the priests still hadn ’ t repaired the temple .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	7	So the king sent for Jehoiada the priest and the other priests . He asked them , “ Why aren ’ t you repairing the temple where it needs it ? Don ’ t take any more money from the people in charge of the treasures . Instead , hand it over so the temple can be repaired. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	8	The priests agreed that they wouldn ’ t collect any more money from the people . They also agreed that they wouldn ’ t repair the temple themselves .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	9	Jehoiada the priest got a chest . He drilled a hole in its lid . He placed the chest beside the altar for burnt offerings . The chest was on the right side as people enter the Lord ’ s temple . Some priests guarded the entrance . They put into the chest all the money the people brought to the temple .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	10	From time to time there was a large amount of money in the chest . When that happened , the royal secretary and the high priest came . They counted the money the people had brought to the temple . Then they put it into bags .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	11	After they added it all up , they used it to repair the temple . They gave it to the men who had been put in charge of the work . Those men used it to pay the workers . They paid the builders and those who worked with wood .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	13	The money the people brought to the Lord ’ s temple wasn ’ t used to make silver bowls . It wasn ’ t used for wick cutters , sprinkling bowls or trumpets . And it wasn ’ t used for any other things made out of gold or silver .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	14	Instead , it was paid to the workers . They used it to repair the temple .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	15	The royal secretary and the high priest didn ’ t require a report from those who were in charge of the work . That ’ s because they were completely honest . They always paid the workers .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	16	Money was received from people who brought guilt offerings and sin offerings . But it wasn ’ t taken to the Lord ’ s temple . It belonged to the priests .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	17	About that time Hazael , the king of Aram , went up and attacked Gath . Then he captured it . After that , he turned back to attack Jerusalem .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	18	But Joash , the king of Judah , didn ’ t want to go to war . So he took all the sacred objects . They had been set apart to the Lord by the kings who had ruled over Judah before him . Those kings were Jehoshaphat , Jehoram and Ahaziah . Joash took the gifts he himself had set apart . He took all the gold that was among the temple treasures . He also took all the gold from the royal palace . He sent all those things to Hazael , the king of Aram . Then Hazael pulled his army back from Jerusalem .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	19	The other events of the rule of Joash are written down . Everything he did is written in the official records of the kings of Judah .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	20	The officials of Joash made evil plans against him . They killed him at Beth Millo . It happened on the road that goes down to Silla .
NIRV	2%20Kings	12	21	The officials who murdered him were Jozabad and Jehozabad . Jozabad was the son of Shimeath . Jehozabad was the son of Shomer . After Joash died , he was buried in the family tomb in the City of David . Joash ’ s son Amaziah became the next king after him . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Kings	13	13	Jehoash joined the members of his family who had already died . He was buried in the royal tombs in Samaria . Jeroboam became the next king on Israel ’ s throne after him .
NIRV	2%20Kings	13	17	“ Open the east window , ” Elisha said . So he did . “ Shoot ! ” Elisha said . So he shot . “ That ’ s the Lord ’ s arrow ! ” Elisha announced . “ It means you will win the battle over Aram ! You will completely destroy the men of Aram at Aphek. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	13	3	So the Lord was very angry with Israel . For a long time he kept them under the power of Hazael , the king of Aram . The Lord also kept them under the power of his son Ben-Hadad .
NIRV	2%20Kings	13	4	Then Jehoahaz asked the Lord for help . The Lord listened to him . The Lord saw how badly the king of Aram was treating Israel .
NIRV	2%20Kings	13	5	The Lord provided someone to save Israel . And they escaped from the power of Aram . So the Israelites lived in their own homes , just as they had before .
NIRV	2%20Kings	13	6	But the people didn ’ t turn away from the sins of the royal house of Jeroboam . He had caused Israel to commit those same sins . The people continued to commit them . And the pole used to worship the female god named Asherah remained standing in Samaria .

NIRV	2%20Kings	13	14	Elisha had been suffering from a sickness . Later he would die from it . Jehoash , the king of Israel , went down to see him . Jehoash wept over him . “ My father ! ” he cried . “ You are like a father to me ! You , Elisha , are the true chariots and horsemen of Israel ! ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	13	15	Elisha said to Jehoash , “ Get a bow and some arrows. ” So he did .
NIRV	2%20Kings	13	18	Elisha continued , “ Get some arrows. ” So the king did . Elisha told him , “ Strike the ground. ” Jehoash struck it three times . Then he stopped .
NIRV	2%20Kings	13	19	The man of God was angry with him . He said , “ You should have struck the ground five or six times . Then you would have won the war over Aram . You would have completely destroyed them . But now you will win only three battles over them. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	13	20	Elisha died and was buried . Some robbers from Moab used to enter the country of Israel every spring .
NIRV	2%20Kings	13	21	One day some Israelites were burying a man . Suddenly they saw a group of robbers . So they threw the man ’ s body into Elisha ’ s tomb . The body touched Elisha ’ s bones . When it did , the man came back to life again . He stood up on his feet .
NIRV	2%20Kings	13	22	Hazael , the king of Aram , treated Israel badly . He did it the whole time Jehoahaz was king .
NIRV	2%20Kings	13	23	But the Lord helped Israel . He was tender and kind to them . He showed concern for them . He did all these things because of the covenant he had made with Abraham , Isaac and Jacob . To this day he hasn ’ t been willing to destroy Israel . And he hasn ’ t driven them out of his land .
NIRV	2%20Kings	13	24	Hazael , the king of Aram , died . His son Ben-Hadad became the next king after him .
NIRV	2%20Kings	13	25	Then Jehoash won back some towns from Ben-Hadad , the son of Hazael . Ben-Hadad had captured them in battle from Jehoahaz , the father of Jehoash . Jehoash won three battles over Ben-Hadad . So Jehoash won back the Israelite towns . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Kings	17	8	The Lord had driven out other nations to make room for Israel . But they followed the evil practices of those nations . They also followed the practices that the kings of Israel had started .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	9	The Israelites did things in secret against the Lord their God . What they did wasn ’ t right . They built high places for worship in all their towns . They built them at lookout towers . They also built them at cities that had high walls around them .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	10	They set up sacred stones . And they set up poles used to worship the female god named Asherah . They did that on every high hill and under every green tree .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	11	The Lord had driven out nations to make room for Israel . But the Israelites burned incense at every high place , just as those nations had done . The Israelites did evil things that made the Lord very angry .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	12	They worshiped statues of gods . They did it even though the Lord had said , “ Do not do that. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	13	The Lord warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and seers . He said , “ Turn from your evil ways . Keep my commands and rules . Obey every part of my Law . I commanded your people who lived long ago to obey it . And I gave it to you through my servants the prophets. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	14	But the people wouldn ’ t listen . They were as stubborn as their people of long ago had been . Those people didn ’ t trust in the Lord their God .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	15	They refused to obey his rules . They broke the covenant he had made with them . They didn ’ t pay any attention to the rules he had warned them to keep . They worshiped worthless statues of gods . Then they themselves became worthless . They followed the example of the nations around them . They did it even though the Lord had ordered them not to . He had said , “ Do not do as they do. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	16	They turned away from all the commands of the Lord their God . They made two statues of gods for themselves . The statues were shaped like calves . They made a pole used to worship the female god named Asherah . They bowed down to all the stars . And they worshiped the god named Baal .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	18	So the Lord was very angry with Israel . He removed them from his land . Only the tribe of Judah was left .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	19	And even Judah didn ’ t obey the commands of the Lord their God . They followed the practices Israel had started .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	20	So the Lord turned his back on all the people of Israel . He made them suffer . He handed them over to people who stole everything they had . And finally he threw them out of his land .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	21	The Lord took control of Israel away from the royal house of David . The Israelites made Jeroboam , the son of Nebat , their king . Jeroboam tried to get Israel to stop following the Lord . He caused them to commit a terrible sin .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	22	The Israelites were stubborn . They continued to commit all the sins Jeroboam had committed . They didn ’ t turn away from them .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	23	So the Lord removed them from his land . That ’ s what he had warned them he would do . He had given that warning through all his servants the prophets . So the people of Israel were taken away from their country . They were forced to go to Assyria . And that ’ s where they still are . Assyria Makes Other People Live in Samaria
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	24	The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon , Kuthah , Avva , Hamath and Sepharvaim . He made all of them live in the towns of Samaria . They took the place of the people of Israel . They lived in all the towns of Samaria .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	25	When they first lived there , they didn ’ t worship the Lord . So he sent lions among them . And the lions killed some of the people .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	26	A report was given to the king of Assyria . He was told , “ You forced people to leave their own homes and live in the towns of Samaria . But they don ’ t know what the god of that country requires . So he has sent lions among them . And the lions are killing the people off . That ’ s because the people don ’ t know what that god requires. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	27	Then the king of Assyria gave an order . He said , “ Get one of the priests you captured from Samaria . Send him back to live there . Have him teach the people what the god of that land requires. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	28	So a priest went back to live in Bethel . He was one of the priests who had been forced to leave Samaria . He taught the people of Bethel how to worship the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	29	In spite of that , the people from each nation made statues of their own gods . They made them in all the towns where they had been forced to live . They set up those statues in small temples . The people of Samaria had built the temples at the high places .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	30	The people from Babylon made statues of the god named Sukkoth Benoth . Those from Kuthah made statues of the god named Nergal . Those from Hamath made statues of the god named Ashima .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	31	The Avvites made statues of the gods named Nibhaz and Tartak . The Sepharvites sacrificed their children in the fire to the gods named Adrammelek and Anammelek . They were the gods of Sepharvaim .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	32	So the people of Samaria worshiped the Lord . But they also appointed all kinds of their own people to be their priests . The priests served in the small temples at the high places .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	33	The people worshiped the Lord . But they also served their own gods . They followed the evil practices of the nations they had been taken from .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	34	The people of Samaria are still stubborn . They continue in their old practices to this day . And now they don ’ t even worship the Lord . They don ’ t follow his directions and rules . They don ’ t obey his laws and commands . The Lord had given all these laws to the family of Jacob . He gave the name Israel to Jacob .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	35	The Lord made a covenant with the Israelites . At that time he commanded them , “ Do not worship any other gods . Do not bow down to them . Do not serve them or sacrifice to them .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	36	The Lord is the one you must worship . The Lord brought you up out of Egypt by his great power . He saved you by reaching out his mighty arm . You must bow down only to him . You must offer sacrifices only to him .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	37	You must always be careful to follow his directions and rules . You must obey the laws and commands he wrote for you . Do not worship other gods .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	38	Do not forget the covenant I made with you . And remember , you must not worship other gods .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	39	Instead , worship the Lord your God . He will save you from the powerful hand of all your enemies. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	40	But the people wouldn ’ t listen . Instead , they were stubborn . They continued in their old practices .
NIRV	2%20Kings	17	41	They worshiped the Lord . But at the same time , they served the statues of their gods . And to this day their children and grandchildren continue to do what their people before them did . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Kings	18	21	Look , I know you are depending on Egypt . Why are you doing that ? Egypt is nothing but a broken papyrus stem . Try leaning on it . It will only cut your hand . Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , is just like that to everyone who depends on him .

NIRV	2%20Kings	18	28	Then the commander stood up and spoke in the Hebrew language . He called out , “ Pay attention to what the great king of Assyria is telling you .
NIRV	2%20Kings	18	30	Don ’ t let Hezekiah talk you into trusting in the Lord . Don ’ t believe him when he says , “ You can be sure that the Lord will save us . This city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria. ” ’
NIRV	2%20Kings	18	31	“ Don ’ t listen to Hezekiah . The king of Assyria says , ‘ Make a peace treaty with me . Come over to my side . Then each one of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig tree . Each one of you will drink water from your own well .
NIRV	2%20Kings	18	32	You will do that until I come back . Then I ’ ll take you to a land just like yours . It ’ s a land that has a lot of grain and fresh wine . It has plenty of bread and vineyards . It has olive trees and honey . So choose life ! Don ’ t choose death ! ’ “ Don ’ t pay any attention to Hezekiah . He ’ s telling you a lie when he says , ‘ The Lord will save us. ’
NIRV	2%20Kings	18	33	Has the god of any nation ever saved his land from the power of the king of Assyria ?
NIRV	2%20Kings	18	34	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim , Hena and Ivvah ? Have they saved Samaria from my power ?
NIRV	2%20Kings	18	35	Which one of all the gods of those countries has been able to save his land from me ? So how can the Lord save Jerusalem from my power ? ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	18	36	But the people remained silent . They didn ’ t say anything . That ’ s because King Hezekiah had commanded , “ Don ’ t answer him. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	18	37	Then Eliakim , the son of Hilkiah , went to Hezekiah . Eliakim was in charge of the palace . Shebna the secretary went with him . So did Joah , the son of Asaph . Joah kept the records . All of them went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn . They told him what the field commander had said . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Kings	19	3	They told Isaiah , “ Hezekiah says , ‘ Today we ’ re in great trouble . The Lord is warning us . He ’ s bringing shame on us . Sometimes babies come to the moment when they should be born . But their mothers aren ’ t strong enough to allow them to be born . Today we are like those mothers . We aren ’ t strong enough to save ourselves .
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	4	Perhaps the Lord your God will hear everything the field commander has said . His master , the king of Assyria , has sent him to make fun of the living God . Maybe the Lord your God will punish him for what he has heard him say . So pray for the remaining people who are still alive here. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	5	King Hezekiah ’ s officials came to Isaiah .
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	6	Then Isaiah said to them , “ Tell your master , ‘ The Lord says , “ Do not be afraid of what you have heard . The officers of the king of Assyria have spoken evil things against me .
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	7	Listen ! I will send him news from his own country . It will make him want to return home . There I will have him killed by a sword. ” ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	8	The field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish . So the commander pulled his troops back from Jerusalem . He went to join the king . He found out that the king was fighting against Libnah .
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	9	During that time Sennacherib received a report . He was told that Tirhakah was marching out to fight against him . Tirhakah was the king of Cush . Sennacherib sent messengers again to Hezekiah with a letter . Sennacherib said ,

NIRV	2%20Kings	19	11	I ’ m sure you have heard about what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries . They have destroyed them completely . So do you think you will be saved ?
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	12	The kings who ruled before me destroyed many nations . Did the gods of those nations save them ? Did the gods of Gozan , Harran or Rezeph save them ? What about the gods of the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar ?
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	13	Where is the king of Hamath ? Where is the king of Arpad ? Where are the kings of Lair , Sepharvaim , Hena and Ivvah ? ’ ” Hezekiah ’ s Prayer
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	14	When Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers , he read it . Then he went up to the Lord ’ s temple . There he spread the letter out in front of the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	15	Hezekiah prayed to the Lord . He said , “ Lord , you are the God of Israel . You sit on your throne between the cherubim . You alone are God over all the kingdoms on earth . You have made heaven and earth .

NIRV	2%20Kings	19	17	“ Lord , it ’ s true that the kings of Assyria have completely destroyed many nations and their lands .
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	18	They have thrown the statues of the gods of those nations into the fire . And they have destroyed them . That ’ s because they weren ’ t really gods at all . They were nothing but statues made out of wood and stone . They were made by human hands .
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	20	Isaiah sent a message to Hezekiah . Isaiah was the son of Amoz . Isaiah said , “ The Lord is the God of Israel . The Lord says , ‘ I have heard your prayer about Sennacherib , the king of Assyria. ’
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	21	Here is the message the Lord has spoken against him . The Lord says , “ ‘ You will not win the battle over Zion . Its people hate you and make fun of you . The people of Jerusalem lift up their heads proudly as you run away .
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	22	Who have you laughed at ? Who have you spoken evil things against ? Who have you raised your voice against ? Who have you looked at so proudly ? You have done it against me . I am the Holy One of Israel !
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	23	Through your messengers you have dared to make fun of the Lord . And you have said , “ I have many chariots . With them I have gone to the tops of the mountains . I ’ ve climbed the highest mountains in Lebanon . I ’ ve cut down its tallest cedar trees . I ’ ve cut down the best of its juniper trees . I ’ ve reached its farthest parts .

NIRV	2%20Kings	19	24	I ’ ve dug wells in strange lands . I ’ ve drunk the water from them . I ’ ve walked through all of Egypt ’ s streams . I ’ ve dried up every one of them. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	25	“ ‘ But I , the Lord , say , “ Haven ’ t you heard what I have done ? Long ago I arranged for you to do all of that . In days of old I planned it . Now I have made it happen . You have turned cities with high walls into piles of stone .

NIRV	2%20Kings	19	27	“ ‘ “ But I know where you are . I know when you come and go . I know how very angry you are with me .
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	28	You roar against me and brag . And I have heard your bragging . So I will put my hook in your nose . I will put my bit in your mouth . And I will make you go home by the same way you came. ” ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	29	The Lord said , “ Hezekiah , here is a miraculous sign for you . “ This year you will eat what grows by itself . In the second year you will eat what grows from that . But in the third year you will plant your crops and gather them in . You will plant your grapevines and eat their fruit .

NIRV	2%20Kings	19	33	By the same way he came he will go home . He will not enter this city , ’ announces the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	34	“ ‘ I will guard this city and save it . I will do it for myself . And I will do it for my servant David. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	19	35	That night the angel of the Lord went into the camp of the Assyrians . He put to death 185,000 people there . The people of Jerusalem got up the next morning and looked out at the camp . There were all the dead bodies !

NIRV	2%20Kings	20	20	The other events of the rule of Hezekiah are written down . That includes how he made the pool and the tunnel . He used them to bring water into Jerusalem . Everything he accomplished is written in the official records of the kings of Judah .

NIRV	2%20Kings	20	4	Isaiah was leaving the middle courtyard . Before he had left it , a message came to him from the Lord . He said ,
NIRV	2%20Kings	20	5	“ Go back and speak to Hezekiah . He is the ruler of my people . Tell him , ‘ The Lord , the God of King David , says , “ I have heard your prayer . I have seen your tears . And I will heal you . On the third day from now you will go up to my temple .

NIRV	2%20Kings	20	15	The prophet asked , “ What did they see in your palace ? ” “ They saw everything in my palace , ” Hezekiah said . “ I showed them all my treasures. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	20	7	Then Isaiah said , “ Press some figs together . Spread them on a piece of cloth. ” So that ’ s what they did . Then they applied it to Hezekiah ’ s boil . And he got well again .
NIRV	2%20Kings	20	8	Hezekiah had said to Isaiah , “ You say the Lord will heal me . You say that I ’ ll go up to his temple on the third day from now . What will the sign be to prove he ’ ll really do that ? ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	20	9	Isaiah answered , “ The Lord will do what he has promised . Here is his sign to you . Do you want the shadow the sun makes to go forward ten steps ? Or do you want it to go back ten steps ? ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	20	10	“ It ’ s easy for the shadow to go forward ten steps , ” said Hezekiah . “ So have it go back ten steps. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	20	11	Then Isaiah the prophet called out to the Lord . And the Lord made the shadow go back ten steps . It went back the ten steps it had gone down on the stairway Ahaz had made . Messengers Come From Babylon to Hezekiah

NIRV	2%20Kings	20	13	Hezekiah received the messengers . He showed them everything in his storerooms . He showed them the silver and gold . He showed them the spices and the fine olive oil . He showed them where he kept his weapons . And he showed them all his treasures . In fact , he showed them everything in his palace and in his whole kingdom .
NIRV	2%20Kings	20	14	Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah . He asked him , “ What did those men say ? Where did they come from ? ” “ They came from a land far away , ” Hezekiah said . “ They came from Babylon. ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	20	16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah , “ Listen to the Lord ’ s message . He says ,
NIRV	2%20Kings	20	17	‘ You can be sure the time will come when everything in your palace will be carried off to Babylon . Everything the kings before you have stored up until this day will be taken away . There will not be anything left , ’ says the Lord .

NIRV	2%20Kings	21	12	I am the Lord , the God of Israel . I tell you , ‘ I am going to bring trouble on Jerusalem and Judah . It will be so horrible that the ears of everyone who hears about it will tingle .
NIRV	2%20Kings	21	55	years . His mother ’ s name was Hephzibah .
NIRV	2%20Kings	21	3	Manasseh rebuilt the high places . His father Hezekiah had destroyed them . Manasseh also set up altars to the god named Baal .

NIRV	2%20Kings	21	5	In the two courtyards of the Lord ’ s temple Manasseh built altars to honor all the stars .

NIRV	2%20Kings	21	9	But the people didn ’ t pay any attention . Manasseh led them astray . They did more evil things than the nations the Lord had destroyed . He had destroyed them to make room for the Israelites .
NIRV	2%20Kings	21	10	The Lord spoke through his servants the prophets . He said ,
NIRV	2%20Kings	21	11	“ Manasseh , the king of Judah , has committed terrible sins . I hate them . Manasseh has done more evil things than the Amorites who were in the land before him . And he has led Judah to commit sin by worshiping his statues of gods .
NIRV	2%20Kings	21	13	I will measure out punishment against Jerusalem , just as I did against Samaria . I used a plumb line against the royal family of Ahab . I used it to prove that they did not measure up to my standards . I will use the same plumb line against Jerusalem . I will wipe out Jerusalem , just as someone wipes a dish . I will wipe it and turn it upside down .
NIRV	2%20Kings	21	14	I will desert those who remain among my people . I will hand them over to their enemies . All their enemies will rob them .
NIRV	2%20Kings	21	15	That ’ s because my people have done what is evil in my sight . They have made me very angry . They have done that from the day their own people came out of Egypt until this day. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Kings	21	16	Manasseh also spilled the blood of many people who weren ’ t guilty of doing anything wrong . He spilled so much blood that he filled Jerusalem with it from one end of the city to the other . And he caused Judah to commit sin . So they also did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord .

NIRV	2%20Kings	22	8	Hilkiah the high priest spoke to Shaphan the secretary . Hilkiah said , “ I ’ ve found the Book of the Law in the Lord ’ s temple. ” Hilkiah gave it to Shaphan , who read it .

NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	6	But Joab didn ’ t include the tribes of Levi and Benjamin in the total number . The king ’ s command was sickening to Joab .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	7	It was also evil in the sight of God . So he punished Israel .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	8	Then David said to God , “ I committed a great sin when I counted Israel ’ s men . I beg you to take away my guilt . I ’ ve done a very foolish thing. ”
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	9	The Lord spoke to Gad , David ’ s prophet . The Lord said ,
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	10	“ Go and tell David , ‘ The Lord says , “ I could punish you in three different ways . Choose one of them for me to punish you with. ” ’ ”
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	11	So Gad went to David . Gad said to him , “ The Lord says , ‘ Take your choice .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	12	You can have three years when there will not be enough food in the land . You can have three months when your enemies will sweep you away . They will catch up with you . They will destroy you with their swords . Or you can have three days when the sword of the Lord will punish you . That means there would be three days of plague in the land . My angel would strike down people in every part of Israel. ’ So take your pick . Tell me how to answer the one who sent me. ”
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	13	David said to Gad , “ I ’ m suffering terribly . Let me fall into the hands of the Lord . His mercy is very great . But don ’ t let me fall into human hands. ”
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	14	So the Lord sent a plague on Israel . And 70,000 Israelites died .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	15	pounds of gold for the property .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	16	David looked up . He saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth . The angel was holding out a sword over Jerusalem . David and the elders fell with their faces to the ground . They were wearing the rough clothing people wear when they ’ re sad .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	17	David said to God , “ I ordered the fighting men to be counted . I ’ m the one who has sinned . I am the shepherd of these people . I ’ m the one who has done what is wrong . These people are like sheep . What have they done ? Lord my God , punish me and my family . But don ’ t let this plague continue to strike your people. ” David Builds an Altar
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	18	Then the angel of the Lord ordered Gad to tell David to go up to the threshing floor of Araunah , the Jebusite . He wanted David to build an altar there to honor the Lord .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	19	So David went up and did it . He obeyed the message that Gad had spoken in the Lord ’ s name .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	20	Araunah was threshing wheat . He turned and saw the angel . Araunah ’ s four children were with him . They hid themselves .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	22	David said to him , “ Let me have the property your threshing floor is on . I want to build an altar there to honor the Lord . When I do , the plague on the people will be stopped . Sell the threshing floor to me for the full price. ”
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	23	Araunah said to David , “ Take it ! King David , you are my master . Do what you please . I ’ ll even provide the oxen for the burnt offerings . Use boards from the threshing sleds for the wood . Use the wheat for the grain offering . I ’ ll give it all to you. ”
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	24	But King David replied to Araunah , “ No ! I want to pay the full price . I won ’ t take what belongs to you and give it to the Lord . I won ’ t sacrifice a burnt offering that hasn ’ t cost me anything. ”
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	25	So David paid Araunah
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	26	David built an altar there to honor the Lord . He sacrificed burnt offerings and friendship offerings . He called out to the Lord . The Lord answered him by sending fire from heaven on the altar for burnt offerings .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	27	Then the Lord spoke to the angel . And the angel put his sword away .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	28	When the angel did that , David was still at the threshing floor of Araunah , the Jebusite . David saw that the Lord had answered him . So he offered sacrifices there .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	29	At that time , the Lord ’ s holy tent was at the high place in Gibeon . The altar for burnt offerings was there too . Moses had made the holy tent in the desert .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	21	30	David couldn ’ t go to the tent to pray to God . That ’ s because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the Lord . Copyright ©

NIRV	1%20Chronicles	22	2	David gave orders to bring together the outsiders who were living in Israel . He appointed some of them to cut stones . He wanted them to prepare blocks of stone for building the house of God .

All the nations should consider it to be famous and beautiful . I ’ ll get things ready for it. ” So David got many things ready before he died .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	22	6	Then he sent for his son Solomon . He told him to build a house for the Lord , the God of Israel .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	22	7	David said to Solomon , “ My son , with all my heart I wanted to build a house for the Lord my God . That ’ s where his Name will be .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	22	8	But a message from the Lord came to me . It said , ‘ You have spilled the blood of many people . You have fought many wars . You are not the one who will build a house for my Name . That is because I have seen you spill the blood of many people on the earth .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	22	9	But you are going to have a son . He will be a man of peace . And I will give him peace and rest from all his enemies on every side . His name will be Solomon . I will give Israel peace and quiet while he is king .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	22	10	He will build a house for my Name . He will be my son . And I will be his father . I will make his kingdom secure over Israel . It will last forever. ’
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	22	11	“ My son , may the Lord be with you . May you have success . May you build the house of the Lord your God , just as he said you would .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	22	12	May the Lord give you good sense . May he give you understanding when he makes you king over Israel . Then you will keep the law of the Lord your God .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	22	13	Be careful to obey the rules and laws the Lord gave Moses for Israel . Then you will have success . Be strong and brave . Don ’ t be afraid . Don ’ t lose hope .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	22	14	“ I ’ ve tried very hard to provide for the Lord ’ s temple . I ’ ve provided 3,750 tons of gold and 37,500 tons of silver . I ’ ve provided more bronze and iron than anyone can weigh . I ’ ve also given plenty of wood and stone . You can add to it .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	22	15	You have a lot of workers . You have people who can cut stones and people who can lay the stones . You have people who can work with wood . You also have people who are skilled in every other kind of work .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	22	16	Some of them can work with gold and silver . Others can work with bronze and iron . There are more workers than anyone can count . So begin the work . May the Lord be with you. ”
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	22	17	Then David ordered all Israel ’ s leaders to help his son Solomon .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	22	18	He said to them , “ The Lord your God is with you . He ’ s given you peace and rest on every side . He ’ s handed over to me the people who are living in the land . The land has been brought under the control of the Lord and his people .
NIRV	1%20Chronicles	22	19	So be committed to the Lord your God with all your heart and soul . Start building the temple of the Lord God . Then bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord into it . Also bring in the sacred objects that belong to God . The temple will be built for the Name of the Lord. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	2	6	So who is able to build a temple for him ? After all , the heavens can ’ t hold him . In fact , not even the highest heavens can hold him . So who am I to build a temple for him ? It will only be a place to burn sacrifices in front of him .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	2	7	“ Send me a man skilled at working with gold , silver , bronze and iron . He must also be able to work with purple , blue and bright red yarn . He must be skilled in the art of carving . Send him to work in Judah and Jerusalem with my skilled workers . My father David provided them to help me .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	2	9	They ’ ll provide me with plenty of lumber . That ’ s because the temple I ’ m building must be large and beautiful .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	2	10	I ’ ll pay your servants . They will cut the wood . I ’ ll pay them 3,600 tons of wheat that has been ground up . I ’ ll pay them 3,000 tons of barley . I ’ ll also pay them 120,000 gallons of wine and 120,000 gallons of olive oil. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	2	11	King Hiram of Tyre replied to Solomon . He wrote a letter to him . In it Hiram said , “ The Lord loves his people . That ’ s why he has made you their king. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	2	12	Hiram continued , “ I praise the Lord . He is the God of Israel . He made heaven and earth . He has given King David a wise son . You have good sense . You understand what is right . You will build a temple for the Lord . You will also build a palace for yourself .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	2	13	“ I ’ m sending Huram-Abi to you . He is very skillful .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	2	14	His mother was from Dan . His father was from Tyre . He is trained to work with gold , silver , bronze and iron . He knows how to work with stone and wood . He can also work with purple , blue and bright red yarn and fine linen . He ’ s skilled in all kinds of carving . He can follow any pattern you give him . He ’ ll work with your skilled workers . He ’ ll also work with those of your father David . David was my master .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	2	15	“ Now please send us what you promised . Send us the wheat , barley , olive oil and wine .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	2	16	And we ’ ll cut all the logs from Lebanon that you need . We ’ ll make rafts out of them . We ’ ll float them by sea down to Joppa . Then you can take them up to Jerusalem. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	2	17	Solomon counted all the outsiders who were living in Israel . He did it after his father David had counted them . There were 153,600 of them .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	5	5	They brought up the ark . They also brought up the tent of meeting and all the sacred things in the tent . The priests , who were Levites , carried up everything .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	5	8	The cherubim ’ s wings were spread out over the place where the ark was . They covered the ark . They also covered the poles used to carry it .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	5	9	The poles reached out from the ark . They were so long that their ends could be seen from in front of the Most Holy Room . But they couldn ’ t be seen from outside the Holy Room . They are still there to this day .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	5	10	There wasn ’ t anything in the ark except the two tablets . Moses had placed them in it at Mount Horeb . That ’ s where the Lord had made a covenant with the Israelites . He made it after they came out of Egypt .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	5	11	The priests left the Holy Room . All the priests who were there had set themselves apart to the Lord . It didn ’ t matter what group they were in .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	6	But now I have chosen Jerusalem . I will put my Name there . And I have chosen David to rule over my people Israel. ’
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	3	The whole community of Israel was standing there . The king turned around and gave them his blessing .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	4	Then he said , “ I praise the Lord . He is the God of Israel . With his mouth he made a promise to my father David . With his powerful hands he made it come true . He said ,
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	5	‘ I brought my people out of Egypt . Since then , a temple for my Name has not been built . I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel for that purpose . And I have not chosen anyone to be ruler over my people Israel .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	7	“ With all his heart my father David wanted to build a temple . He wanted to do it so the Name of the Lord could be there . The Lord is the God of Israel .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	8	But the Lord spoke to my father David . He said , ‘ With all your heart you wanted to build a temple for my Name . It is good that you wanted to do that .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	9	But you will not build the temple . Instead , your son will build the temple for my Name . He is your own flesh and blood. ’
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	10	“ The Lord has kept the promise he made . I ’ ve become the next king after my father David . Now I ’ m sitting on the throne of Israel . That ’ s exactly what the Lord promised would happen . I ’ ve built the temple for the Name of the Lord . He is the God of Israel .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	11	I ’ ve placed the ark there . The tablets of the Lord ’ s covenant are inside it . He made that covenant with the people of Israel. ” Solomon Prays to Set the Temple Apart to the Lord
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	12	Then Solomon stood in front of the Lord ’ s altar . He stood in front of the whole community of Israel . He spread out his hands to pray .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	13	He had made a bronze stage . It was seven and a half feet long and seven and a half feet wide . It was four and a half feet high . He had placed it in the center of the outer courtyard . He stood on the stage . Then he got down on his knees in front of the whole community of Israel . He spread out his hands toward heaven .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	14	He said , “ Lord , you are the God of Israel . There is no God like you in heaven or on earth . You keep the covenant you made with us . You show us your love . You do that when we follow you with all our hearts .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	15	You have kept your promise to my father David . He was your servant . With your mouth you made a promise . With your powerful hand you have made it come true . And today we can see it .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	16	“ Lord , you are the God of Israel . Keep the promises you made to my father David . Do it for him . He was your servant . You said to him , ‘ You will always have a son from your family line to sit on Israel ’ s throne . He will sit in front of the Most Holy Room , where my own throne is . That will be true only if your children after you are careful in everything they do . They must live the way my law tells them to . That is the way you have lived. ’
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	17	Lord , you are the God of Israel . So let your promise to your servant David come true .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	18	“ But will God really live on earth with human beings ? After all , the heavens can ’ t hold you . In fact , even the highest heavens can ’ t hold you . So this temple I ’ ve built certainly can ’ t hold you !
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	19	But please pay attention to my prayer . Lord my God , be ready to help me as I make my appeal to you . Listen to my cry for help . Hear the prayer I ’ m praying to you .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	23	When they do , listen to them from heaven . Take action . Judge between the person and their neighbor . Pay back the guilty one . Do to them what they have done to their neighbor . Deal with the one who isn ’ t guilty in a way that shows they are free from blame . That will prove they aren ’ t guilty .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	30	Then listen to them from heaven . It ’ s the place where you live . Forgive them . Deal with everyone in keeping with everything they do . You know their hearts . In fact , you are the only one who knows every human heart .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	31	Your people will have respect for you . They will live the way you want them to . They ’ ll live that way as long as they are in the land you gave our people long ago .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	32	“ Suppose an outsider who doesn ’ t belong to your people Israel has come from a land far away . They have come because they ’ ve heard about your great name .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	6	38	And they turn back to you with all their heart and soul . Suppose it happens in the land where they were taken as prisoners . There they pray toward the land you gave their people long ago . They pray toward the city you have chosen . And they pray toward the temple I ’ ve built for your Name .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	2	The priests couldn ’ t enter the temple of the Lord because his glory filled it .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	7	Solomon set the middle area of the courtyard apart to the Lord . It was in front of the Lord ’ s temple . There Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings . He also sacrificed the fat of the friendship offerings there . He did it there because the bronze altar he had made couldn ’ t hold it all . It couldn ’ t hold the burnt offerings , the grain offerings and the fat parts .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	3	All the Israelites saw the fire coming down . They saw the glory of the Lord above the temple . So they got down on their knees in the courtyard with their faces toward the ground . They worshiped the Lord . They gave thanks to him and said , “ The Lord is good . His faithful love continues forever. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices to the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	5	King Solomon sacrificed 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep and goats . So the king and all the people set the temple of God apart .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	6	The priests and Levites took their positions . The Levites played the Lord ’ s musical instruments . King David had made them for praising the Lord . They were used when he gave thanks to the Lord . He said , “ His faithful love continues forever. ” Across from where the Levites were , the priests blew their trumpets . All the people of Israel were standing .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	8	At that time Solomon celebrated the Feast of Booths for seven days . The whole community of Israel was with him . It was a huge crowd . People came from as far away as Lebo Hamath and the Wadi of Egypt .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	9	On the eighth day they held a special service . For seven days they had celebrated by setting the altar apart to honor God . The feast continued for seven more days .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	10	Then Solomon sent the people home . It was the 23rd day of the seventh month . The people were glad . Their hearts were full of joy . That ’ s because the Lord had done good things for David and Solomon and his people Israel . The Lord Appears to Solomon
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	11	Solomon finished the Lord ’ s temple and the royal palace . He had done everything he had planned to do in the Lord ’ s temple and his own palace .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	12	The Lord appeared to him at night . The Lord said , “ I have heard your prayer . I have chosen this place for myself . It is a temple where sacrifices will be offered .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	13	“ Suppose I close up the sky and there isn ’ t any rain . Suppose I command locusts to eat up the crops . And I send a plague among my people .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	14	But they make themselves humble in my sight . They pray and look to me . And they turn from their evil ways . Then I will listen to them from heaven . I will forgive their sin . And I will heal their land . After all , they are my people .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	15	Now my eyes will see them . My ears will pay attention to the prayers they offer in this place .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	16	I have chosen this temple . I have set it apart for myself . My Name will be there forever . My eyes and my heart will always be there .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	17	“ But you must walk faithfully with me , just as your father David did . Do everything I command you to do . Obey my rules and laws .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	18	Then I will set up your royal throne . I made a covenant with your father David to do that . I said to him , ‘ You will always have a son from your family line to rule over Israel. ’
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	19	“ But suppose all of you turn away from me . You refuse to obey the rules and commands I have given you . And you go off to serve other gods and worship them .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	20	Then I will remove Israel from my land . It is the land I gave them . I will turn my back on this temple . I will do it even though I have set it apart for my Name to be there . I will make all the nations hate it . They will laugh and joke about it .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	21	This temple will become a pile of stones . All those who pass by it will be shocked . They will say , ‘ Why has the Lord done a thing like this to this land and temple ? ’
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	7	22	People will answer , ‘ Because they have deserted the Lord . He is the God of their people who lived long ago . He brought them out of Egypt . But they have been holding on to other gods . They ’ ve been worshiping them . They ’ ve been serving them . That ’ s why the Lord has brought all this horrible trouble on them. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	10	2	Jeroboam heard about it . He was the son of Nebat . Jeroboam was in Egypt at that time . He had gone there for safety . He wanted to get away from King Solomon . But now he returned from Egypt .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	10	10	The young men who had grown up with him gave their answer . They replied , “ The people have said to you , ‘ Your father put a heavy load on our shoulders . Make it lighter. ’ Now tell them , ‘ My little finger is stronger than my father ’ s legs .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	10	3	So the people sent for Jeroboam . He and all the people went to Rehoboam . They said to him ,
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	10	4	“ Your father put a heavy load on our shoulders . But now make our hard work easier . Make the heavy load on us lighter . Then we ’ ll serve you. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	10	5	Rehoboam answered , “ Come back to me in three days. ” So the people went away .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	10	6	Then King Rehoboam asked the elders for advice . They had served his father Solomon while he was still living . Rehoboam asked them , “ What advice can you give me ? How should I answer these people ? ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	10	7	They replied , “ Be kind to them . Please them . Give them what they are asking for . Then they ’ ll always serve you. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	10	8	But Rehoboam didn ’ t accept the advice the elders gave him . He asked for advice from the young men who had grown up with him and were now serving him .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	10	13	The king answered them in a mean way . He didn ’ t accept the advice of the elders .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	10	14	Instead , he followed the advice of the young men . He said , “ My father put a heavy load on your shoulders . But I ’ ll make it even heavier . My father beat you with whips . But I ’ ll beat you with bigger whips. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	10	15	So the king didn ’ t listen to the people . That ’ s because God had planned it that way . What the Lord had said through Ahijah came true . Ahijah had spoken the Lord ’ s message to Jeroboam , the son of Nebat . Ahijah was from Shiloh .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	10	16	All the Israelites saw that the king refused to listen to them . So they answered the king . They said , “ We don ’ t have any share in David ’ s royal family . We don ’ t have any share in Jesse ’ s son . People of Israel , let ’ s go back to our homes . David ’ s royal family , take care of your own kingdom ! ” So all the Israelites went home .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	10	17	But Rehoboam still ruled over the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	12	6	The king and the leaders of Israel made themselves humble in the Lord ’ s sight . They said , “ The Lord does what is right and fair. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	12	7	The Lord saw they had made themselves humble . So he gave a message to Shemaiah . The Lord said , “ They have made themselves humble in my sight .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	2	Azariah went out to meet Asa . He said to him , “ Asa and all you people of Judah and Benjamin , listen to me . The Lord is with you when you are with him . If you really look for him , you will find him . But if you desert him , he will desert you .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	15	All the people of Judah were happy about the promise they had made . They turned to God with all their heart . When they did , they found him . So the Lord gave them peace and rest on every side .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	3	For a long time Israel didn ’ t worship the true God . They didn ’ t have a priest who taught them . So they didn ’ t know God ’ s law .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	4	But when they were in trouble , they turned to the Lord , the God of Israel . When they did , they found him .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	5	In those days it wasn ’ t safe to travel around . The people who lived in all the areas of the land were having a lot of trouble .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	6	One nation was crushing another . One city was crushing another . That ’ s because God was causing them to suffer terribly .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	7	But be strong . Don ’ t give up . God will reward you for your work. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	8	Asa heard that prophecy . He paid attention to the words of Azariah the prophet , the son of Oded . So Asa became bolder than ever . He removed the statues of gods from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin . He also removed them from the towns he had captured in the hills of Ephraim . He did it because the Lord hated those gods . Asa repaired the altar of the Lord . It was in front of the porch of the Lord ’ s temple .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	9	Then Asa gathered together all the people of Judah and Benjamin . He also gathered together the people from Ephraim , Manasseh and Simeon who were living among them . Large numbers of people had come over to him from Israel . They came because they saw that the Lord his God was with him .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	10	They gathered in Jerusalem . It was the third month of the 15th year of Asa ’ s rule .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	11	At that time they sacrificed to the Lord
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	700	oxen and 7,000 sheep and goats . The animals were among the things they had taken after the battle .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	12	They made a covenant to obey the Lord , the God of their people . They would obey him with all their heart and soul .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	13	All those who wouldn ’ t obey the Lord , the God of Israel , would be killed . It wouldn ’ t matter how important they were . It wouldn ’ t matter whether they were men or women .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	14	They made a promise to the Lord . They praised him out loud . They shouted . They blew trumpets and horns .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	16	King Asa also removed his grandmother Maakah from her position as queen mother . That ’ s because she had made a pole used to worship the female god named Asherah . The Lord hated it . So Asa cut it down . He broke it up . He burned it in the Kidron Valley .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	17	Asa didn ’ t remove the high places from Israel . But he committed his whole life completely to the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	18	He and his father had set apart silver , gold and other things to the Lord . Asa brought them into God ’ s temple .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	15	19	There weren ’ t any more wars until the 35th year of Asa ’ s rule . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	16	2	Asa took the silver and gold from among the treasures of the Lord ’ s temple and his own palace . He sent it to Ben-Hadad . Ben-Hadad was king of Aram . He was ruling in Damascus .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	16	16	Baasha was king of Israel . He marched out against Judah . It was in the 36th year of Asa ’ s rule over Judah . Baasha built up the walls of Ramah . He did it to keep people from leaving or entering the territory of Asa , the king of Judah .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	16	3	“ Let ’ s make a peace treaty between us , ” Asa said . “ My father and your father had made a peace treaty between them . Now I ’ m sending you silver and gold . So break your treaty with Baasha , the king of Israel . Then he ’ ll go back home. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	16	4	Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa . He sent his army commanders against the towns of Israel . His army captured Ijon , Dan , Abel Maim and all the cities in Naphtali where Baasha stored things .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	16	5	Baasha heard about it . So he stopped building up Ramah and left that place .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	16	6	Then King Asa brought all the men of Judah to Ramah . They carried away the stones and wood Baasha had been using . Asa used them to build up Geba and Mizpah .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	16	7	At that time Hanani the prophet came to Asa , the king of Judah . He said to him , “ You trusted the king of Aram . You didn ’ t trust in the Lord your God . So the army of the king of Aram has escaped from you .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	16	8	The people of Cush and Libya had a strong army . They had large numbers of chariots and horsemen . But you trusted in the Lord . So he handed them over to you .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	16	9	The Lord looks out over the whole earth . He gives strength to those who commit their lives completely to him . You have done a foolish thing . From now on you will be at war. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	16	10	Asa was angry with the prophet because of what he had said . In fact , he was so angry he put him in prison . At the same time , Asa treated some of his own people very badly .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	16	11	The events of Asa ’ s rule from beginning to end are written down . They are written in the records of the kings of Judah and Israel .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	16	12	In the 39th year of Asa ’ s rule his feet began to hurt . The pain was terrible . But even though he was suffering , he didn ’ t look to the Lord for help . All he did was go to the doctors .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	16	13	In the 41st year of Asa ’ s rule he joined the members of his family who had already died .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	16	14	He was buried in a tomb . He had cut it out for himself in the City of David . His body was laid on a wooden frame . It was covered with spices and different mixes of perfume . A huge fire was made to honor him . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	17	3	The Lord was with Jehoshaphat . That ’ s because he lived the way King David had lived . He didn ’ t ask for advice from the gods that were named Baal .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	17	4	Instead , Jehoshaphat obeyed the God of his father . He obeyed the Lord ’ s commands instead of the practices of Israel .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	17	5	The Lord made the kingdom secure under Jehoshaphat ’ s control . All the people of Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat . So he had great wealth and honor .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	17	6	His heart was committed to living the way the Lord wanted him to . He removed the high places from Judah . He also removed the poles used to worship the female god named Asherah .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	17	9	They taught people all through Judah . They took the Book of the Law of the Lord with them . They went around to all the towns of Judah . And they taught the people .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	17	10	All the kingdoms of the lands around Judah became afraid of the Lord . So they didn ’ t go to war against Jehoshaphat .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	17	11	Some Philistines brought to Jehoshaphat the gifts and silver he required of them . The Arabs brought him their flocks . They brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	17	12	Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful . He built forts in Judah . He also built cities in Judah where he could store things .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	17	13	He had large supplies in the towns of Judah . In Jerusalem he kept men who knew how to fight well .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	17	14	Here is a list of them , family by family . From Judah there were commanders of groups of 1,000 . One of them was Adnah . He commanded 300,000 fighting men .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	17	15	Another was Jehohanan . He commanded 280,000 .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	2	Some years later he went down to see Ahab in Samaria . Ahab killed a lot of sheep and cattle for Jehoshaphat and the people with him . Ahab tried to get Jehoshaphat to attack Ramoth Gilead .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	18	Micaiah continued , “ Listen to the Lord ’ s message . I saw the Lord sitting on his throne . Some of the angels of heaven were standing at his right side . The others were standing at his left side .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	3	Ahab was the king of Israel . He spoke to Jehoshaphat , the king of Judah . He asked , “ Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead ? ” Jehoshaphat replied , “ Yes . I ’ ll go with you . My men will also go with your men . We ’ ll join you in the war. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	4	He continued , “ First ask the Lord for advice. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	5	So the king of Israel brought
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	400	prophets together . He asked them , “ Should we go to war against Ramoth Gilead , or not ? ” “ Go , ” they answered . “ God will hand it over to you. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	6	But Jehoshaphat asked , “ Is there no longer a prophet of the Lord here ? If there is , ask him what we should do. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	7	The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat . He said , “ There is still one prophet we can go to . We can ask the Lord for advice through him . But I hate him . He never prophesies anything good about me . He only prophesies bad things . His name is Micaiah . He ’ s the son of Imlah. ” “ You shouldn ’ t say bad things about him , ” Jehoshaphat replied .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	8	So the king of Israel called for one of his officials . He told him , “ Bring Micaiah , the son of Imlah , right away. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	9	The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat , the king of Judah , were wearing their royal robes . They were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor . It was near the entrance of the gate of Samaria . All the prophets were prophesying in front of them .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	10	Zedekiah was the son of Kenaanah . Zedekiah had made horns out of iron . They looked like animal horns . He announced , “ The Lord says , ‘ With these horns you will drive back the men of Aram until they are destroyed. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	11	All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing . “ Attack Ramoth Gilead , ” they said . “ Win the battle over it . The Lord will hand it over to you. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	12	A messenger went to get Micaiah . He said to him , “ Look . The other prophets agree . All of them are saying the king will have success . So agree with them . Say the same thing they do. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	13	But Micaiah said , “ You can be sure that the Lord lives . And you can be just as sure that I can only tell the king what my God says. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	14	When Micaiah arrived , the king spoke to him . He asked , “ Should we go to war against Ramoth Gilead , or not ? ” “ Attack , ” he answered . “ You will win . The people of Ramoth Gilead will be handed over to you. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	15	The king said to him , “ I ’ ve made you promise to tell the truth many times before . So don ’ t tell me anything but the truth in the name of the Lord. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	16	Then Micaiah answered , “ I saw all the Israelites scattered on the hills . They were like sheep that didn ’ t have a shepherd . The Lord said , ‘ These people do not have a master . Let each of them go home in peace. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	17	The king of Israel spoke to Jehoshaphat . He said , “ Didn ’ t I tell you he never prophesies anything good about me ? He only prophesies bad things. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	19	The Lord said , ‘ Who will get Ahab , the king of Israel , to attack Ramoth Gilead ? I want him to die there. ’ “ One angel suggested one thing . Another suggested something else .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	20	Finally , a spirit came forward and stood in front of the Lord . The spirit said , ‘ I ’ ll get Ahab to do it. ’ “ ‘ How ? ’ the Lord asked .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	21	“ The spirit said , ‘ I ’ ll go and put lies in the mouths of all his prophets. ’ “ ‘ You will have success in getting Ahab to attack Ramoth Gilead , ’ said the Lord . ‘ Go and do it. ’
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	22	“ So the Lord has put lies in the mouths of your prophets . He has said that great harm will come to you. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	23	Then Zedekiah , the son of Kenaanah , went up and slapped Micaiah in the face . Zedekiah asked Micaiah , “ Do you think the spirit sent by the Lord left me ? Do you think that spirit went to speak to you ? ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	24	Micaiah replied , “ You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inside room to save your life. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	25	Then the king of Israel gave an order . He said , “ Take Micaiah away . Send him back to Amon . Amon is the ruler of the city of Samaria . And send Micaiah back to Joash . Joash is a member of the royal court .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	26	Tell them , ‘ The king says , “ Put this fellow in prison . Don ’ t give him anything but bread and water until I return safely. ” ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	27	Micaiah announced , “ Do you really think you will return safely ? If you do , the Lord hasn ’ t spoken through me. ” He continued , “ All you people , remember what I ’ ve said ! ” Ahab Is Killed at Ramoth Gilead
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	28	So the king of Israel went up to Ramoth Gilead . Jehoshaphat , the king of Judah , went there too .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	29	The king of Israel spoke to Jehoshaphat . He said , “ I ’ ll go into battle wearing different clothes . Then people won ’ t recognize me . But you wear your royal robes. ” So the king of Israel put on different clothes . Then he went into battle .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	30	The king of Aram had given an order to his chariot commanders . He had said , “ Fight only against the king of Israel . Don ’ t fight against anyone else. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	31	The chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat . They thought , “ That ’ s the king of Israel. ” So they turned to attack him . But Jehoshaphat cried out . And the Lord helped him . God drew the commanders away from him .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	32	They saw he wasn ’ t the king of Israel after all . So they stopped chasing him .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	33	But someone shot an arrow without taking aim . The arrow hit the king of Israel between the parts of his armor . The king told the chariot driver , “ Turn the chariot around . Get me out of this battle . I ’ ve been wounded. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	18	34	All day long the battle continued . The king of Israel kept himself standing up by leaning against the inside of his chariot . He kept his face toward the men of Aram until evening . At sunset he died . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	19	4	Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem . He went out again among the people . He went from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim . He turned the people back to the Lord , the God of Israel .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	19	5	Jehoshaphat appointed judges in the land . He put them in all the cities of Judah that had high walls around them .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	19	6	He told the judges , “ Think carefully about what you do . After all , you aren ’ t judging for human beings . You are judging for the Lord . He ’ s with you every time you make a decision .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	19	7	Have respect for the Lord . Judge carefully . He is always right . He treats everyone the same . Our God doesn ’ t want his judges to take money from people who want special favors. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	19	8	In Jerusalem , Jehoshaphat chose some Levites and priests . He also chose some leaders of Israelite families . He appointed all of them to apply the law of the Lord fairly . He wanted them to decide cases . He wanted them to settle matters between people . All those judges lived in Jerusalem .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	19	9	Here are the orders Jehoshaphat gave them . He said , “ Have respect for the Lord . Serve him faithfully . Do it with all your heart .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	19	10	Cases will come to you from your people who live in the other cities . The cases might be about murder or other matters dealt with by the law , commands , directions and rules . Warn the people not to sin against the Lord . If you don ’ t warn them , he will be angry with you and your people . Do what I say . Then you won ’ t sin .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	19	11	“ Amariah the chief priest will be over you in any matter that concerns the Lord . Zebadiah is the leader of the tribe of Judah . He is the son of Ishmael . Zebadiah will be over you in any matter that concerns the king . The Levites will serve as your officials . Be brave . And may the Lord be with those of you who do well. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	2	Some people came and told him , “ A huge army is coming from Edom to fight against you . They have come across the Dead Sea . They are already in Hazezon Tamar. ” Hazezon Tamar is also called En Gedi .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	20	Early in the morning all the people left for the Desert of Tekoa . As they started out , Jehoshaphat stood up . He said , “ Judah , listen to me ! People of Jerusalem , listen to me ! Have faith in the Lord your God . He ’ ll take good care of you . Have faith in his prophets . Then you will have success. ”

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	7	Our God , you drove out the people who lived in this land . You drove them out to make room for your people Israel . You gave this land forever to those who belong to the family line of your friend Abraham .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	8	They have lived in this land . They ’ ve built a temple here for your Name . They have said ,

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	10	“ But here are men from Ammon , Moab and Mount Seir . You wouldn ’ t allow Israel to march in and attack their territory when the Israelites came from Egypt . So Israel turned away from them . They didn ’ t destroy them .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	13	All the men of Judah stood there in front of the Lord . Their wives , children and little ones were with them .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	18	Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face toward the ground . All the people of Judah and Jerusalem also bowed down . They worshiped the Lord .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	21	Jehoshaphat asked the people for advice . Then he appointed men to sing to the Lord . He wanted them to praise the Lord because of his glory and holiness . They marched out in front of the army . They said , “ Give thanks to the Lord . His faithful love continues forever. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	22	They began to sing and praise him . Then the Lord hid some men and told them to wait . He wanted them to attack the people of Ammon , Moab and Mount Seir . They had gone into Judah and attacked it . But they lost the battle .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	23	The Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the men from Mount Seir . They destroyed them . They put an end to them . When they finished killing the men from Seir , they destroyed one another .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	24	The men of Judah came to the place that looks out over the desert . They turned to look down at the huge army . But all they saw was dead bodies lying there on the ground . No one had escaped .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	25	years . His mother ’ s name was Azubah . She was the daughter of Shilhi .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	26	On the fourth day they gathered together in the Valley of Berakah . There they praised the Lord . That ’ s why it ’ s called the Valley of Berakah to this day .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	27	Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned to Jerusalem . They were filled with joy . Jehoshaphat led them . The Lord had made them happy because all their enemies were dead .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	28	They entered Jerusalem and went to the Lord ’ s temple . They were playing harps , lyres and trumpets .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	29	All the surrounding kingdoms began to have respect for God . They had heard how the Lord had fought against Israel ’ s enemies .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	30	The kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace . His God had given him peace and rest on every side . Jehoshaphat ’ s Rule Comes to an End
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	31	So Jehoshaphat ruled over Judah . He was
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	35	Jehoshaphat king of Judah and Ahaziah king of Israel agreed to be friends . Ahaziah did what was evil .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	20	33	But the high places weren ’ t removed . The people still hadn ’ t worshiped the God of Israel with all their hearts .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	2	Jehoram ’ s brothers , the sons of Jehoshaphat , were Azariah , Jehiel , Zechariah , Azariahu , Michael and Shephatiah . All of them were sons of Jehoshaphat , the king of Israel .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	21	Jehoshaphat joined the members of his family who had already died . He was buried in the family tomb in the City of David . Jehoshaphat ’ s son Jehoram became the next king after him .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	3	Their father had given them many gifts . He had given them silver , gold and other things of value . He had also given them cities in Judah that had high walls around them . But he had made Jehoram king . That ’ s because Jehoram was his oldest son . Jehoram King of Judah
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	4	Jehoram made his position secure over his father ’ s kingdom . Then he killed all his brothers with his sword . He also killed some of the officials of Israel .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	5	Jehoram was
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	32	years old when he became king . He ruled in Jerusalem for eight years . No one was sorry when he passed away . He was buried in the City of David . But he wasn ’ t placed in the tombs of the kings . Copyright ©
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	6	He followed the ways of the kings of Israel , just as the royal family of Ahab had done . In fact , he married a daughter of Ahab . Jehoram did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	7	But the Lord didn ’ t want to destroy the royal family of David . That ’ s because the Lord had made a covenant with him . The Lord had promised to keep the lamp of David ’ s kingdom burning brightly . The Lord had promised that for David and his children after him forever .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	8	When Jehoram was king over Judah , Edom refused to remain under Judah ’ s control . They set up their own king .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	9	So Jehoram went to Edom . He took his officers and all his chariots with him . The men of Edom surrounded him and his chariot commanders . But he got up at night and fought his way out .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	10	To this day Edom has refused to remain under Judah ’ s control . At that same time , Libnah also refused to remain under the control of Judah . That ’ s because Jehoram had deserted the Lord , the God of his people .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	11	Jehoram had also built high places on the hills of Judah . He had caused the people of Jerusalem to worship other gods . They weren ’ t faithful to the Lord . Jehoram had led Judah down the wrong path .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	12	Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet . In it , Elijah said , “ The Lord is the God of your father David . The Lord says , ‘ You have not followed the ways of your own father Jehoshaphat or of Asa , the king of Judah .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	13	Instead , you have followed the ways of the kings of Israel . You have led Judah and the people of Jerusalem to worship other gods , just as the royal family of Ahab did . Also , you have murdered your own brothers . They were members of your own family . They were better men than you are .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	14	So now the Lord is about to strike down your people with a heavy blow . He will strike down your sons , your wives and everything that belongs to you .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	15	And you yourself will be very sick for a long time . The sickness will finally cause your insides to come out. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	16	The Lord stirred up the anger of the Philistines against Jehoram . He also stirred up the anger of the Arabs . They lived near the people of Cush .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	17	The Philistines and Arabs attacked Judah . They went in and carried off all the goods they found in the king ’ s palace . They also took his sons and wives . The only son he had left was Ahaziah . He was the youngest son .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	18	After all of that , the Lord made Jehoram very sick . He couldn ’ t be healed .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	21	19	After he had been sick for two years , the sickness caused his insides to come out . He died in great pain . His people didn ’ t make a funeral fire to honor him . They had made funeral fires to honor the kings who ruled before him .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	22	2	Ahaziah was
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	22	22	years old when he became king . He ruled in Jerusalem for one year . His mother ’ s name was Athaliah . She was a granddaughter of Omri .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	22	3	Ahaziah also followed the ways of the royal family of Ahab . That ’ s because Ahaziah ’ s mother gave him bad advice . She told him to do what was wrong .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	22	4	So he did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord . He did what the family of Ahab had done . After Ahaziah ’ s father died , the members of Ahab ’ s family became his advisers . That ’ s what destroyed him .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	22	5	He also followed their advice when he joined forces with Joram , the king of Israel . They went to war against Hazael at Ramoth Gilead . Joram was the son of Ahab . Hazael was king of Aram . The soldiers of Aram wounded Joram .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	22	6	So he returned to Jezreel to give his wounds time to heal . His enemies had wounded him at Ramoth in his battle against Hazael , the king of Aram . Ahaziah , the son of Jehoram , went down to Jezreel . He went there to see Joram . That ’ s because Joram had been wounded . Ahaziah was king of Judah . Joram was the son of Ahab .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	22	7	Through Ahaziah ’ s visit to Joram , God caused Ahaziah to fall from power . When Ahaziah arrived , he rode out with Joram to meet Jehu , the son of Nimshi . The Lord had anointed Jehu to destroy the royal family of Ahab .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	22	8	So Jehu punished Ahab ’ s family , just as the Lord had told him to . While he was doing it , he found the officials of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah ’ s relatives . They had been serving Ahaziah . So Jehu killed them .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	22	9	Then he went to look for Ahaziah . Jehu ’ s men captured him while he was hiding in Samaria . Ahaziah was brought to Jehu and put to death . People buried him , because they said , “ He was a grandson of Jehoshaphat , who followed the Lord with all his heart. ” So no one in the royal family of Ahaziah was powerful enough to keep the kingdom . Athaliah and Joash
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	22	10	Athaliah was Ahaziah ’ s mother . She saw that her son was dead . So she began to wipe out the whole royal family of Judah .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	22	11	But Jehosheba went and got Joash , the son of Ahaziah . Jehosheba was the daughter of King Jehoram . She stole Joash away from among the royal princes . All of them were about to be murdered . She put Joash and his nurse in a bedroom . Jehosheba , the daughter of King Jehoram , was the wife of Jehoiada the priest . She was also Ahaziah ’ s sister . So Jehosheba hid the child from Athaliah . That ’ s why Athaliah couldn ’ t kill him .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	22	12	The child remained hidden with the priest and his wife at God ’ s temple for six years . Athaliah ruled over the land during that time . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	2	They went all through Judah . They gathered together the Levites and the leaders of Israelite families from all the towns . They came to Jerusalem .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	23	When Joash was seven years old , Jehoiada showed how strong he was . He made a covenant with the commanders of groups of
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	100	men . They were in charge of the troops . He said to them , “ Bring her away from the temple between the line of guards . Use your swords to kill anyone who follows her. ” The priest had said , “ Don ’ t put her to death at the Lord ’ s temple. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	3	The whole community made a covenant with the new king at God ’ s temple . Jehoiada said to them , “ Ahaziah ’ s son will rule over Judah . That ’ s what the Lord promised concerning the family line of David .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	4	Here ’ s what I want you to do . A third of you priests and Levites who are going on duty on the Sabbath day must guard the doors .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	5	A third of you must guard the royal palace . And a third of you must guard the Foundation Gate . All the other men must guard the courtyards of the Lord ’ s temple .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	6	Don ’ t let anyone enter the temple except the priests and Levites who are on duty . They can enter because they are set apart to the Lord . But all the other men must obey the Lord ’ s command not to enter .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	7	The Levites must station themselves around the new king . Each man must have his weapon in his hand . Anyone else who enters the temple must be put to death . Stay close to the king no matter where he goes. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	8	The Levites did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered . So did all the men of Judah . Each commander got his men . Some of the men were going on duty on the Sabbath day . Others were going off duty . Jehoiada didn ’ t let any of the groups go .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	9	Then he gave weapons to the commanders of the groups . He gave them spears , large shields and small shields . The weapons had belonged to King David . They had been in God ’ s temple .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	10	Jehoiada stationed all the men around the new king . Each man had his weapon in his hand . They were standing near the altar and the temple . They stood from the south side of the temple to its north side .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	11	Jehoiada and his sons brought Ahaziah ’ s son out . They put the crown on him . They gave him a copy of the covenant . And they announced that he was king . They anointed him . Then they shouted , “ May the king live a long time ! ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	12	Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and cheering the new king . So she went to them at the Lord ’ s temple .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	13	She looked , and there was the king ! He was standing next to his pillar at the entrance . The officers and trumpet players were standing beside the king . All the people of the land were filled with joy . They were blowing trumpets . Musicians with their musical instruments were leading the songs of praise . Then Athaliah tore her royal robes . She shouted , “ Treason ! It ’ s treason ! ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	14	Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of the groups of
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	15	So they grabbed her as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds . There they put her to death .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	16	Then Jehoiada made a covenant . He promised that he , the people and the king would be the Lord ’ s people .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	17	All the people went to Baal ’ s temple . They tore it down . They smashed the altars and the statues of gods . They killed Mattan in front of the altars . He was the priest of Baal .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	18	Then Jehoiada put the priests , who were Levites , in charge of the Lord ’ s temple . David had given them their duties in the temple . He had appointed them to sacrifice burnt offerings to the Lord . He wanted them to do it in keeping with what was written in the Law of Moses . David wanted them to sing and be full of joy .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	19	Jehoiada stationed guards at the gates of the Lord ’ s temple . No one who was “ unclean ” in any way could enter .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	23	20	Jehoiada took with him the commanders of hundreds , the nobles , the rulers of the people , and all the people of the land . He brought the new king down from the Lord ’ s temple . They went into the palace through the Upper Gate . Then they seated the king on the royal throne .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	2	Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord . Joash lived that way as long as Jehoiada the priest was alive .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	24	The army of Aram had come with only a few men . But the Lord allowed them to win the battle over a much larger army . Judah had deserted the Lord , the God of their people . That ’ s why the Lord punished Joash .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	40	years . His mother ’ s name was Zibiah . She was from Beersheba .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	3	Jehoiada chose two wives for Joash . They had sons and daughters by Joash .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	4	Some time later Joash decided to make the Lord ’ s temple look like new again .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	5	He called together the priests and Levites . He said to them , “ Go to the towns of Judah . Collect the money that the nation of Israel owes every year . Use it to repair the temple of your God . Do it now. ” But the Levites didn ’ t do it right away .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	6	So the king sent for Jehoiada the chief priest . He said to him , “ Why haven ’ t you required the Levites to bring in the tax from Judah and Jerusalem ? It was set up by the Lord ’ s servant Moses and the whole community of Israel . It was used for the tent where the tablets of the covenant law were kept. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	7	The children of that evil woman Athaliah had broken into God ’ s temple . They had used even its sacred objects for the gods that were named Baal .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	8	King Joash commanded that a wooden chest be made . It was placed outside near the gate of the Lord ’ s temple .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	9	Then a message went out in Judah and Jerusalem . It said that the people should bring the tax to the Lord . God ’ s servant Moses had required Israel to pay that tax when they were in the desert .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	10	All the officials and people gladly brought their money . They dropped it into the chest until it was full .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	11	The chest was brought in by the Levites to the king ’ s officials . Every time the officials saw there was a large amount of money in the chest , it was emptied out . The royal secretary and the officer of the chief priest came and emptied it . Then they carried it back to its place . They did it regularly . They collected a great amount of money .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	12	The king and Jehoiada gave it to the people who were doing the work on the Lord ’ s temple . They hired people who could lay the stones and people who could work with wood . They also hired people who could work with iron and bronze . They hired all of them to repair the temple .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	13	The men in charge of the work did their best . The repairs went very well under them . They rebuilt God ’ s temple . They did it in keeping with its original plans . They made the temple even stronger .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	14	So they finished the work . Then they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada . It was used to pay for the objects that were made for the Lord ’ s temple . The objects were used for serving at the temple . They were also used for the burnt offerings . The objects included dishes and other things made out of gold and silver . As long as Jehoiada lived , burnt offerings were sacrificed continually at the Lord ’ s temple .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	15	Jehoiada had become very old . He died at the age of
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	130	.
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	16	He was buried with the kings in the City of David . That ’ s because he had done so many good things in Israel for God and his temple . The Evil Things Joash Did
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	17	After Jehoiada died , the officials of Judah came to King Joash . They bowed down to him . He listened to them .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	18	They turned their backs on the temple of the Lord , the God of their people . They worshiped poles made to honor the female god named Asherah . They also worshiped statues of other gods . Because Judah and Jerusalem were guilty of sin , God became angry with them .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	19	The Lord sent prophets to the people to bring them back to him . The prophets told the people what they were doing wrong . But the people wouldn ’ t listen .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	20	Then the Spirit of God came on Zechariah the priest . He was the son of Jehoiada . Zechariah stood in front of the people . He told them , “ God says , ‘ Why do you refuse to obey my commands ? You will not have success . You have deserted me . So I have deserted you. ’ ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	21	But the people made evil plans against Zechariah . The king ordered them to kill Zechariah by throwing stones at him . They did it in the courtyard of the Lord ’ s temple .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	22	King Joash didn ’ t remember how kind Zechariah ’ s father Jehoiada had been to him . So he killed Jehoiada ’ s son . As Zechariah was dying he said , “ May the Lord see this . May he hold you responsible. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	23	In the spring , the army of Aram marched into Judah and Jerusalem against Joash . They killed all the leaders of the people . They took a large amount of goods from Judah . They sent it to their king in Damascus .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	25	The army of Aram pulled back . They left Joash badly wounded . His officials planned to do evil things to him . That ’ s because he murdered the son of Jehoiada the priest . They killed Joash in his bed . So he died . He was buried in the City of David . But he wasn ’ t placed in the tombs of the kings .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	26	Those who made the plans against Joash were Zabad and Jehozabad . Zabad was the son of Shimeath . She was from Ammon . Jehozabad was the son of Shimrith . She was from Moab .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	24	27	The story of the sons of Joash is written in the notes on the records of the kings . The many prophecies about him are written there too . So is the record of how he made God ’ s temple look like new again . Joash ’ s son Amaziah became the next king after him . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	25	Amaziah king of Judah lived for
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	29	years . His mother ’ s name was Jehoaddan . She was from Jerusalem .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	3	The kingdom was firmly under his control . So he put to death the officials who had murdered his father , the king .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	4	But he didn ’ t put their children to death . He obeyed what is written in the Law , the Book of Moses . There the Lord commanded , “ Parents must not be put to death because of what their children do . And children must not be put to death because of what their parents do . People must die because of their own sins. ” ( Deuteronomy 24:16 )
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	5	Amaziah called the people of Judah together . He arranged them by families under commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds . He did it for all the people of Judah and Benjamin . Then he brought together the men who were
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	20	But Amaziah wouldn ’ t listen . That ’ s because God had planned to hand Judah over to Jehoash . After all , they had asked the gods of Edom for advice .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	6	He also hired 100,000 fighting men from Israel . He had to pay them almost four tons of silver .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	7	But a man of God came to him . He said , “ Your Majesty , these troops from Israel must not march out with you . The Lord is not with Israel . He isn ’ t with any of the people of Ephraim .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	8	Go and fight bravely in battle if you want to . But God will destroy you right in front of your enemies . God has the power to help you or destroy you. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	9	Amaziah asked the man of God , “ But what about all that silver I paid for these Israelite troops ? ” The man of God replied , “ The Lord can give you much more than that. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	10	So Amaziah let the troops go who had come to him from Ephraim . He sent them home . They were very angry with Judah . They were still very angry when they went home .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	11	Then Amaziah showed how strong he was . He led his army to the Valley of Salt . There he killed 10,000 men of Seir .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	12	The army of Judah also captured 10,000 men alive . The army of Judah took them to the top of a cliff . Then they threw them down . All of them were smashed to pieces .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	13	The troops Amaziah had sent back attacked some towns that belonged to Judah . Amaziah hadn ’ t allowed the troops to take part in the war . They attacked towns from Samaria to Beth Horon . They killed 3,000 people . They carried off huge amounts of goods .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	14	Amaziah returned from killing the men of Edom . He brought back the statues of the gods of Seir . He set them up as his own gods . He bowed down to them . He burned sacrifices to them .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	15	years after Jehoash king of Israel died . Amaziah was the son of Joash . Jehoash was the son of Jehoahaz .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	16	While the prophet was still speaking , the king spoke to him . He said , “ Did I ask you for advice ? Stop ! If you don ’ t , you will be struck down. ” So the prophet stopped . But then he said , “ I know that God has decided to destroy you . That ’ s because you have worshiped other gods . You haven ’ t listened to my advice. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	17	Amaziah , the king of Judah , spoke to his advisers . Then he sent a message to Jehoash , the king of Israel . Jehoash was the son of Jehoahaz . Jehoahaz was the son of Jehu . Amaziah dared Jehoash , “ Come on ! Let us face each other in battle ! ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	18	But Jehoash , the king of Israel , answered Amaziah , the king of Judah . Jehoash said , “ A thorn bush in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar tree there . The thorn bush said , ‘ Give your daughter to be married to my son. ’ Then a wild animal in Lebanon came along . It crushed the thorn bush by walking on it .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	19	You brag that you have won the battle over Edom . You are very proud . But stay home ! Why ask for trouble ? Why bring yourself crashing down ? Why bring Judah down with you ? ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	21	So Jehoash , the king of Israel , attacked . He and Amaziah , the king of Judah , faced each other in battle . The battle took place at Beth Shemesh in Judah .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	22	Israel drove Judah away . Every man ran home .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	23	Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah at Beth Shemesh . Amaziah was the son of Joash . Joash was the son of Ahaziah . Jehoash brought Amaziah to Jerusalem . Jehoash broke down part of its wall . It ’ s the part that went from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate . That part of the wall was
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	600	feet long .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	24	Jehoash took all the gold and silver . He took all the objects he found in God ’ s temple . Obed-Edom had been in charge of them . Jehoash also took the palace treasures and the prisoners . Then he returned to Samaria .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	26	The other events of Amaziah ’ s rule from beginning to end are written down . They are written in the records of the kings of Judah and Israel .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	25	27	Amaziah turned away from obeying the Lord . From that time on , some people made evil plans against him in Jerusalem . So he ran away to Lachish . But they sent men after him to Lachish . There they killed him .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	28	Ahaz was
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	20	Tiglath-Pileser came to Ahaz . But he gave Ahaz trouble instead of help . Tiglath-Pileser was king of Assyria .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	16	At that time King Ahaz sent men to the king of Assyria to get help .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	3	He burned sacrifices in the Valley of Ben Hinnom . He sacrificed his children in the fire to other gods . He followed the practices of the nations . The Lord hates these practices . The Lord had driven out those nations to make room for the people of Israel .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	4	Ahaz offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places . He also did it on the tops of hills and under every green tree .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	5	So the Lord his God handed him over to the king of Aram . The men of Aram won the battle over him . They took many of his people as prisoners . They brought them to Damascus . God also handed Ahaz over to Pekah . Pekah was king of Israel . His army wounded or killed many of the troops of Ahaz .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	6	In one day Pekah , the son of Remaliah , killed 120,000 soldiers in Judah . That ’ s because Judah had deserted the Lord , the God of their people .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	7	Zikri was a fighting man from Ephraim . He killed Maaseiah , Azrikam and Elkanah . Maaseiah was the king ’ s son . Azrikam was the officer who was in charge of the palace . And Elkanah was next in command after the king .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	8	The men of Israel captured 200,000 wives , sons and daughters from their relatives in Judah . They also took a large amount of goods . They carried all of it back to Samaria .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	9	But a prophet of the Lord was there . His name was Oded . When the army returned to Samaria , he went out to meet them . He said to them , “ The Lord is the God of your people . He was very angry with Judah . So he handed them over to you . But you have killed them . Your anger reached all the way to heaven .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	10	Now you are planning to make the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves . But aren ’ t you also guilty of sins against the Lord your God ?
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	11	Listen to me ! You have taken your relatives from Judah as prisoners . The Lord is very angry with you . So send your relatives back. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	12	Then some of the leaders in Ephraim stood up to those who were returning from the war . The leaders were Azariah , Berekiah , Jehizkiah and Amasa . Azariah was the son of Jehohanan . Berekiah was the son of Meshillemoth . Jehizkiah was the son of Shallum . And Amasa was the son of Hadlai .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	13	“ Don ’ t bring those prisoners here , ” they said . “ If you do , we ’ ll be guilty in the sight of the Lord . Do you really want to add to our sin and guilt ? We ’ re already very guilty . The Lord is very angry with Israel. ”

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	18	At the same time the Philistines had attacked towns in the western hills and in the Negev Desert of Judah . They had captured Beth Shemesh , Aijalon and Gederoth . They had also captured Soko , Timnah and Gimzo and the villages around them . They had settled down in all of them .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	19	The Lord had made Judah less powerful because of Ahaz , their king . Ahaz had stirred up the people of Judah to do evil things . He hadn ’ t been faithful to the Lord at all .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	21	Ahaz took some things from the Lord ’ s temple . He also took some from the royal palace and from the officials . He gave all of them to the king of Assyria . But that didn ’ t help Ahaz .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	23	Ahaz offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus . They had won the battle over him . Ahaz thought , “ The gods of the kings of Aram have helped them . So I ’ ll sacrifice to those gods . Then they ’ ll help me. ” But those gods only caused his ruin . In fact , those gods caused the ruin of the whole nation of Israel .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	24	Ahaz gathered together everything that belonged to God ’ s temple . He cut all of it in pieces . Ahaz shut the doors of the Lord ’ s temple . He set up altars at every street corner in Jerusalem .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	25	In every town in Judah he built high places . Sacrifices were burned there to other gods . That made the Lord , the God of his people , very angry .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	26	The other events of the rule of Ahaz and all his evil practices from beginning to end are written down . They are written in the records of the kings of Judah and Israel .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	28	27	Ahaz joined the members of his family who had already died . He was buried in the city of Jerusalem . But he wasn ’ t placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel . Ahaz ’ s son Hezekiah became the next king after him . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	5	He said , “ Levites , listen to me ! Set yourselves apart to the Lord . Set apart the temple of the Lord . He ’ s the God of your people who lived long ago . Remove anything ‘ unclean ’ from the temple .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	6	Our people weren ’ t faithful . They did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord our God . They deserted him . They turned their faces away from the place where he lives . They turned their backs on him .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	7	They also shut the doors of the temple porch . They put the lamps out . They didn ’ t burn incense at the temple . They didn ’ t sacrifice burnt offerings there to the God of Israel .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	8	So the Lord has become angry with Judah and Jerusalem . He has made them look so bad that everyone is shocked when they see them . They laugh at them . You can see it with your own eyes .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	9	That ’ s why our fathers have been killed by swords . That ’ s why our sons and daughters and wives have become prisoners .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	10	So I ’ m planning to make a covenant with the Lord , the God of Israel . Then he ’ ll stop being angry with us .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	11	My sons , don ’ t fail to obey the Lord . He has chosen you to stand in front of him and work for him . He wants you to serve him and burn incense to him. ”

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	16	The priests went into the Lord ’ s temple to make it pure . They brought out to the temple courtyard everything that was “ unclean. ” They had found “ unclean ” things in the Lord ’ s temple . The Levites took them and carried them out to the Kidron Valley .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	17	On the first day of the first month they began to set everything in the temple apart to the Lord . By the eighth day of the month they reached the Lord ’ s porch . For eight more days they set the Lord ’ s temple itself apart to him . They finished on the 16th day of the first month .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	18	Then they went to King Hezekiah . They reported , “ We ’ ve purified the whole temple of the Lord . That includes the altar for burnt offerings and all its tools . It also includes the table for the holy bread and all its objects .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	19	We ’ ve prepared all the things King Ahaz had removed . We ’ ve set them apart to the Lord . Ahaz had removed them while he was king . He wasn ’ t faithful to the Lord . Those things are now in front of the Lord ’ s altar. ”

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	21	They brought seven bulls , seven rams , seven male lambs and seven male goats with them . They sacrificed the animals as a sin offering for the kingdom , for the temple and for Judah . The king commanded the priests to offer them on the Lord ’ s altar . The priests were from the family line of Aaron .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	22	They killed the bulls . Then they splashed the blood against the altar . Next they killed the rams and splashed the blood against the altar . Then they killed the lambs and splashed the blood against the altar .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	23	The goats for the sin offering were brought to the king and the whole community . They placed their hands on them .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	26	So the Levites stood ready with David ’ s musical instruments . And the priests had their trumpets ready .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	27	Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar . The offering began . Singing to the Lord also began . The singing was accompanied by the trumpets and by the instruments of David . He had been king of Israel .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	31	Then Hezekiah said , “ You have set yourselves apart to the Lord . Come and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to his temple. ” So the whole community brought sacrifices and thank offerings . Everyone who wanted to brought burnt offerings .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	32	The whole community brought
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	70	bulls ,
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	100	rams and

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	33	The total number of animals set apart as sacrifices to the Lord was
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	600	bulls and 3,000 sheep and goats .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	34	But there weren ’ t enough priests to skin all the burnt offerings . So their relatives , the Levites , helped them . They worked until the task was finished . By that time other priests had been set apart to the Lord . The Levites had been more careful than the priests when they set themselves apart .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	29	35	There were large numbers of burnt offerings , along with the drink offerings and the fat from the friendship offerings . They were offered along with the burnt offerings . So the service of the Lord ’ s temple was started up again .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	30	3	They hadn ’ t been able to celebrate it at the regular time . That ’ s because there weren ’ t enough priests who had set themselves apart to the Lord . Also , the people hadn ’ t gathered together in Jerusalem .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	30	4	The plan seemed good to the king and the whole community .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	30	5	They decided to send a message all through Israel . It was sent out from Beersheba all the way to Dan . The message invited the people to come to Jerusalem . It invited them to celebrate the Passover Feast to honor the Lord , the God of Israel . The Passover Feast hadn ’ t been celebrated by large numbers of people for a long time .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	30	6	Messengers went all through Israel and Judah . They carried letters from the king and his officials . The king had ordered them to do that . The letters said , “ People of Israel , return to the Lord . He is the God of Abraham , Isaac and Israel . Return to him . Then he will return to you who are left in the land .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	30	11	In spite of that , some people from Asher , Manasseh and Zebulun made themselves humble . They went to Jerusalem .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	30	12	God helped the people of Judah . He helped them agree with one another . So they did what the king and his officials had ordered . They did what the Lord told them to do .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	30	17	Many people in the crowd hadn ’ t set themselves apart to the Lord . They weren ’ t “ clean. ” They couldn ’ t set apart their lambs to him . So the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all of them .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	30	18	Many people came from Ephraim , Manasseh , Issachar and Zebulun . Most of them hadn ’ t made themselves pure and “ clean. ” But they still ate the Passover meal . That was against what was written in the law . But Hezekiah prayed for them . He said , “ The Lord is good . May he forgive everyone
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	30	19	who wants to worship God with all their heart . God is the Lord , the God of their people . May God forgive them even if they aren ’ t ‘ clean ’ in keeping with the rules of the temple. ”

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	32	Hezekiah did many things that showed he was faithful to the Lord . Those things and the other events of his rule are written down . They are written in the record of the vision of the prophet Isaiah , the son of Amoz . That record is part of the records of the kings of Judah and Israel .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	3	So he asked his officials and military leaders for advice . He asked them about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city . They gave him the advice he asked for .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	4	They gathered together a large group of people . They blocked all the springs . They also blocked the stream that flowed through the land . “ Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water ? ” they asked .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	5	Then Hezekiah worked hard repairing all the broken parts of the wall . He built towers on it . He built another wall outside that one . He built up the areas that had been filled in around the City of David . He also made large numbers of weapons and shields .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	6	He appointed military officers over the people . He gathered the officers together in front of him in the open area at the city gate . He gave them words of hope . He said ,
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	7	“ Be strong . Be brave . Don ’ t be afraid . Don ’ t lose hope . The king of Assyria has a huge army with him . But there ’ s a greater power with us than there is with him .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	8	The only thing he has is human strength . But the Lord our God is with us . He will help us . He ’ ll fight our battles. ” The people had great faith in what Hezekiah , the king of Judah , said .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	9	Later Sennacherib , the king of Assyria , and all his forces surrounded Lachish . They prepared to attack it . At that time , Sennacherib sent his officers to Jerusalem .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	11	Hezekiah says , “ The Lord our God will save us from the power of the king of Assyria. ” But he isn ’ t telling you the truth . If you listen to him , you will die of hunger and thirst .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	12	Didn ’ t Hezekiah himself remove your god ’ s high places and altars ? Didn ’ t Hezekiah say to the people of Judah and Jerusalem , “ You must worship at one altar . You must burn sacrifices on it ” ?
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	13	“ ‘ Don ’ t you know what I and the kings who ruled before me have done ? Don ’ t you know what we ’ ve done to all the peoples of the other lands ? Were the gods of those nations ever able to save their lands from my power ?
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	14	The kings who ruled before me destroyed many nations . Which one of the gods of those nations has been able to save his people from me ? So how can your god save you from my power ?

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	17	The king also wrote letters against the Lord . His letters made fun of the God of Israel . They said , “ The peoples of other lands have their gods . But those gods didn ’ t save their people from my power . So the god of Hezekiah won ’ t save his people from my power either. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	18	Then the officers called out in the Hebrew language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall . They were trying to scare them and make them afraid . That ’ s because they wanted to capture the city .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	19	They were comparing the God of Jerusalem to the gods of the other nations of the world . But those gods were only statues . They had been made by human hands .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	20	King Hezekiah cried out in prayer to God in heaven . He prayed about the problem Jerusalem was facing . So did Isaiah the prophet . He was the son of Amoz .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	21	The Lord sent an angel . The angel wiped out all the enemy ’ s fighting men , commanders and officers . He put an end to them right there in the camp of the Assyrian king . So Sennacherib went back to his own land in shame . He went into the temple of his god . There some of his own sons , the people closest to him , killed him with their swords .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	22	So the Lord saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem . He saved them from the power of Sennacherib , the king of Assyria . He also saved them from all their other enemies . He took care of them on every side .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	23	Many people brought offerings to Jerusalem for the Lord . They brought expensive gifts for Hezekiah , the king of Judah . From then on , all the nations thought well of him . Hezekiah ’ s Pride , Success and Death
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	24	In those days Hezekiah became sick . He knew he was about to die . So he prayed to the Lord . And the Lord answered him . He gave him a miraculous sign .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	25	But Hezekiah ’ s heart was proud . He didn ’ t give thanks for the many kind things the Lord had done for him . So the Lord became angry with him . He also became angry with Judah and Jerusalem .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	26	Then Hezekiah had a change of heart . He was sorry he had been proud . The people of Jerusalem were also sorry they had sinned . So the Lord wasn ’ t angry with them as long as Hezekiah was king .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	27	Hezekiah was very rich . He received great honor . He made storerooms for his silver and gold . He also made them for his jewels , spices , shields and all kinds of expensive things .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	30	Hezekiah blocked up the upper opening of the Gihon spring . He directed the water to flow down to the west side of the City of David . He had success in everything he did .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	31	The rulers of Babylon sent messengers to him . They asked him about the miraculous sign that had taken place in the land . Then God left Hezekiah to test him . God wanted to know everything in Hezekiah ’ s heart .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	32	33	Hezekiah joined the members of his family who had already died . He was buried on the hill where the tombs of David ’ s family are . The whole nation of Judah honored him when he died . So did the people of Jerusalem . Hezekiah ’ s son Manasseh became the next king after him . Copyright ©

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	33	10	The Lord spoke to Manasseh and his people . But they didn ’ t pay any attention to him .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	35	15	Those who played music were from the family line of Asaph . They were in the places that had been set up by David , Asaph , Heman and Jeduthun . Jeduthun had been the king ’ s prophet . The guards at each gate didn ’ t have to leave their places . That ’ s because their brother Levites got things ready for them .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	35	16	So at that time the entire service to honor the Lord was carried out . The Passover Feast was celebrated . The burnt offerings were sacrificed on the Lord ’ s altar . That ’ s what King Josiah had ordered .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	35	17	The Israelites who were there celebrated the Passover Feast at that time . They observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	35	18	The Passover Feast hadn ’ t been observed like that in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet . None of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated a Passover Feast like Josiah ’ s . He celebrated it with the priests and Levites . All the people of Judah and Israel were there along with the people of Jerusalem . He celebrated it with them too .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	35	19	That Passover Feast was celebrated in the 18th year of Josiah ’ s rule . Josiah Dies
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	35	20	Josiah had put the temple in order . After all of that , Necho went up to fight at Carchemish . He was king of Egypt . Carchemish was on the Euphrates River . Josiah marched out to meet Necho in battle .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	35	21	But Necho sent messengers to him . They said , “ Josiah king of Judah , there isn ’ t any trouble between you and me . I ’ m not attacking you at this time . I ’ m at war with another country . God told me to hurry . He ’ s with me . So stop opposing him . If you don ’ t , he ’ ll destroy you. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	35	22	But Josiah wouldn ’ t turn away from Necho . Josiah wore different clothes so people wouldn ’ t recognize him . He wanted to go to war against Necho . He wouldn ’ t listen to what God had commanded Necho to say . Instead , Josiah went out to fight him on the plains of Megiddo .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	35	23	Men who had bows shot arrows at King Josiah . After he was hit , he told his officers , “ Take me away . I ’ m badly wounded. ”
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	35	24	So they took him out of his chariot . They put him in his other chariot . They brought him to Jerusalem . There he died . He was buried in the tombs of his family . All the people of Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	35	25	Jeremiah wrote songs of sadness about Josiah . To this day all the male and female singers remember Josiah by singing those songs . That became a practice in Israel . The songs are written down in the Book of the Songs of Sadness .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	35	26	Josiah did many things that showed he was faithful to the Lord . Those things and the other events of Josiah ’ s rule were in keeping with what is written in the Law of the Lord .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	36	14	And that ’ s not all . The people and all the leaders of the priests became more and more unfaithful . They followed all the practices of the nations .

NIRV	2%20Chronicles	36	15	The Lord , the God of Israel , sent word to his people through his messengers . He sent it to them again and again . He took pity on his people . He also took pity on the temple where he lived .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	36	16	But God ’ s people made fun of his messengers . They hated his words . They laughed at his prophets . Finally the Lord ’ s great anger was stirred up against his people . Nothing could save them .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	36	17	The Lord brought the king of the Babylonians against them . The Babylonian army killed their young people with their swords at the temple . They didn ’ t spare young men or young women . They didn ’ t spare the old people or weak people either . God handed all of them over to Nebuchadnezzar .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	36	19	The Babylonians set God ’ s temple on fire . They broke down the wall of Jerusalem . They burned all the palaces . They destroyed everything of value there .
NIRV	2%20Chronicles	36	20	Nebuchadnezzar took the rest of the people to Babylon as prisoners . They had escaped from being killed by swords . They served him and those who ruled after him . That lasted until the kingdom of Persia came to power .

NIRV	Ezra	3	3	The people who built the altar were afraid of the nations around them . But they built it anyway . They set it up where it had stood before . They sacrificed burnt offerings on it to the Lord . They offered the morning and evening sacrifices on it .
NIRV	Ezra	3	2	Then Joshua began to build the altar for burnt offerings to honor the God of Israel . Joshua was the son of Jozadak . The other priests helped Joshua . So did Zerubbabel and his men . They built the altar according to what is written in the Law of Moses . Moses was a man of God . Zerubbabel was the son of Shealtiel .
NIRV	Ezra	3	4	Then they celebrated the Feast of Booths . They did it according to what is written in the Law . They sacrificed the number of burnt offerings required for each day .
NIRV	Ezra	3	5	After they celebrated the Feast of Booths , they sacrificed the regular burnt offerings . They offered the New Moon sacrifices . They also offered the sacrifices for all the appointed sacred feasts of the Lord . And they sacrificed the offerings the people chose to give him .
NIRV	Ezra	3	6	On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the Lord . They did it even though the foundation of the Lord ’ s temple hadn ’ t been laid yet . The People Begin to Rebuild the Temple
NIRV	Ezra	3	7	The people gave money to those who worked with stone and those who worked with wood . They gave food and drink and olive oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre . Then those people brought cedar logs down from Lebanon to the Mediterranean Sea . They floated them down to Joppa . Cyrus , the king of Persia , authorized them to do it .
NIRV	Ezra	3	8	It was the second month of the second year after they had arrived at the house of God in Jerusalem . Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , began the work . Joshua , the son of Jozadak , helped him . So did everyone else . That included the priests and Levites . It also included the rest of those who had returned to Jerusalem . They had been prisoners in the land of Babylon . Levites who were
NIRV	Ezra	3	20	years old or more were appointed to be in charge of building the Lord ’ s house .
NIRV	Ezra	3	9	Those who joined together to direct the work included Joshua and his sons and brothers . They also included Kadmiel and his sons . And they included the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothers . All those men were Levites . Kadmiel and his sons were members of the family line of Hodaviah .
NIRV	Ezra	3	10	The builders laid the foundation of the Lord ’ s temple . Then the priests came . They were wearing their special clothes . They brought their trumpets with them .

NIRV	Ezra	3	12	But many of the older priests and Levites and family leaders wept out loud . They had seen the first temple . So when they saw the foundation of the second temple being laid , they wept . Others shouted with joy .
NIRV	Ezra	3	13	No one could tell the difference between the shouts of joy and the sounds of weeping . That ’ s because the people made so much noise . The sound was heard far away . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezra	4	4	Then the nations around Judah tried to make its people lose hope . They wanted to make them afraid to go on building .
NIRV	Ezra	4	2	Then those enemies came to Zerubbabel . The family leaders of Israel were with him . The enemies said , “ We want to help you build . We ’ re just like you . We worship your God . We offer sacrifices to him . We ’ ve been doing that ever since the time of Esarhaddon . He was king of Assyria . He brought our people here. ”
NIRV	Ezra	4	3	Zerubbabel and Joshua answered them . So did the rest of the family leaders of Israel . They said , “ You can ’ t help us build a temple to honor our God . You aren ’ t part of us . We ’ ll build it ourselves . We ’ ll do it to honor the Lord , the God of Israel . Cyrus , the king of Persia , commanded us to build it. ”
NIRV	Ezra	4	5	So those nations paid some of the Jewish officials to work against the people of Judah . They wanted their plans to fail . They did it during the whole time Cyrus was king of Persia . They kept doing it until Darius became king . Later Enemies Also Oppose the Jews
NIRV	Ezra	4	6	The enemies of the Jews brought charges against the people of Judah and Jerusalem . It happened when Xerxes began to rule over Persia .
NIRV	Ezra	4	7	Then Artaxerxes became king of Persia . During his rule , Bishlam , Mithredath , Tabeel and their friends wrote a letter to Artaxerxes . It was written in the Aramaic language . And it used the Aramaic alphabet .
NIRV	Ezra	4	8	Rehum and Shimshai also wrote a letter to King Artaxerxes . Rehum was the commanding officer . Shimshai was the secretary . Their letter was against the people of Jerusalem . It said ,
NIRV	Ezra	4	9	We , Rehum and Shimshai , are writing this letter . Rehum is the commanding officer . Shimshai is the secretary . Our friends join us in writing . They include the judges , officials and managers in charge of the people from Persia , Uruk and Babylon . They are also over the Elamites from Susa .
NIRV	Ezra	4	10	And they are over those who were forced to leave their countries . The great King Ashurbanipal , who is worthy of honor , forced them to leave . He moved them to the city of Samaria . He also moved them to other places west of the Euphrates River .
NIRV	Ezra	4	11	Here is a copy of the letter sent to Artaxerxes . We are sending this letter to you , King Artaxerxes . It is from your servants who live west of the Euphrates River .
NIRV	Ezra	4	12	We want you to know about the people who left you and have come up to us . They have gone to Jerusalem and are rebuilding that evil city . It has caused trouble for a long time . Those people are making its walls like new again . They are repairing the foundations .
NIRV	Ezra	4	13	Here is something else we want you to know . Suppose this city is rebuilt . And suppose its walls are made like new again . Then no more taxes , gifts or fees will be collected . And sooner or later there will be less money for you .
NIRV	Ezra	4	14	We owe a lot to you . We don ’ t want to see dishonor brought on you . So we ’ re sending this letter to tell you what is going on .
NIRV	Ezra	4	15	Then you can have a search made in the official records . Have someone check the records of the kings who ruled before you . If you do , you will find out that Jerusalem is an evil city . It causes trouble for kings and countries . For a long time the city has refused to let anyone rule over it . That ’ s why it was destroyed .
NIRV	Ezra	4	16	We want you to know that this city shouldn ’ t be rebuilt . Its walls shouldn ’ t be made like new again . If that happens , you won ’ t have anything left west of the Euphrates River .
NIRV	Ezra	4	17	The king replied , I am writing this letter to Rehum , the commanding officer . I am also writing it to Shimshai the secretary . And I am writing it to your friends living in Samaria and in other places west of the Euphrates River . I give you my greetings .
NIRV	Ezra	4	18	The letter you sent us has been read to me . It has been explained to me in my language .
NIRV	Ezra	4	19	I gave an order . I had a search made . Here is what we found out . Jerusalem has a long history of turning against the kings of the countries that have ruled over it . It has refused to remain under their control . It is always stirring up trouble .
NIRV	Ezra	4	20	Jerusalem has had powerful kings . Some of them ruled over everything west of the Euphrates . Taxes , gifts and fees were paid to them .
NIRV	Ezra	4	21	So give an order to those men . Make them stop their work . Then the city won ’ t be rebuilt until I give the order .
NIRV	Ezra	4	22	Pay careful attention to this matter . Why should we let this danger grow ? That would not be in our best interests .
NIRV	Ezra	4	23	The copy of the letter of King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum and Shimshai the secretary . It was also read to their friends . Right away they went to the Jews in Jerusalem . They forced them to stop their work .
NIRV	Ezra	4	24	And so the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a stop . No more work was done on it until the second year that Darius was king of Persia . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezra	5	2	Zerubbabel , the son of Shealtiel , began to work . So did Joshua , the son of Jozadak . They began to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem . The prophets of God were right there with them . They were helping them .
NIRV	Ezra	5	3	At that time Tattenai was governor of the land west of the Euphrates River . He and Shethar-Bozenai and their friends went to the Jews . They asked them , “ Who authorized you to rebuild this temple ? Who told you that you could finish it ? ”
NIRV	Ezra	5	4	They also asked , “ What are the names of the people who are putting up this building ? ”
NIRV	Ezra	5	6	Here is a copy of the letter sent to King Darius . It was from Tattenai , the governor of the land west of the Euphrates . Shethar-Bozenai joined him in writing it . So did their friends . They were officials of that land .
NIRV	Ezra	5	7	The report they sent to the king said , We are sending this letter to you , King Darius . We give you our most friendly greetings .
NIRV	Ezra	5	8	We want you to know that we went to the land of Judah . We went to the temple of the great God . The people are building it with large stones . They are putting wooden beams in the walls . The people are working hard . The work is moving ahead very quickly under the direction of the people .
NIRV	Ezra	5	9	We asked the elders some questions . We said to them , “ Who authorized you to rebuild this temple ? Who told you that you could finish it ? ”
NIRV	Ezra	5	10	We also asked them what their names were . We wanted to write down the names of their leaders for your information .
NIRV	Ezra	5	11	Here is the answer they gave us . They said , “ We serve the God of heaven and earth . We are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago . The great King Solomon built it and finished it .
NIRV	Ezra	5	12	But our people made the God of heaven angry . So he handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar from Chaldea . He was king of Babylon . He destroyed this temple . He forced the Jews to leave their own country . He took them away to Babylon .
NIRV	Ezra	5	13	“ But King Cyrus gave an order to rebuild this house of God . He gave it in the first year he was king of Babylon .
NIRV	Ezra	5	14	He even removed some gold and silver objects from the temple of Babylon . Nebuchadnezzar had brought them there from the house of God in Jerusalem . He had taken them to the temple in Babylon . Then King Cyrus brought the objects out . He gave them to a man named Sheshbazzar . Cyrus had appointed him as governor .
NIRV	Ezra	5	15	Cyrus told him , ‘ Take these objects with you . Go and put them in the temple in Jerusalem . Rebuild the house of God in the same place where it stood before. ’
NIRV	Ezra	5	16	“ So Sheshbazzar made the trip to Jerusalem . He laid the foundations of the house of God there . From that day until now the people have been working on it . But they haven ’ t finished it yet. ”
NIRV	Ezra	5	17	If it pleases you , King Darius , let a search be made in the royal records . Search the official records of the kings of Babylon . Find out whether King Cyrus really did give an order to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem . Then tell us what you decide to do . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezra	6	6	Tattenai , you are governor of the land west of the Euphrates River . I want you to stay away from the temple in Jerusalem . I also want you , Shethar-Bozenai , and you other officials of that area to stay away from it .
NIRV	Ezra	6	2	A book was found in a safe storeroom at Ecbatana in the land of Media . Here is what was written on it . This is my official reply to your letter .
NIRV	Ezra	6	3	In the first year that Cyrus was king , he gave an order . It concerned God ’ s temple in Jerusalem . King Cyrus said , Rebuild the temple . Then the Jews can offer sacrifices there . Lay its foundations . The temple must be
NIRV	Ezra	6	90	feet wide .
NIRV	Ezra	6	4	Its walls must have three layers of large stones . They must also have a layer of beautiful wood . Use money from the royal treasures to pay for everything .
NIRV	Ezra	6	5	The gold and silver objects from the house of God must be returned . Nebuchadnezzar had taken them from the first temple in Jerusalem . And he had brought them to Babylon . Now they must be returned to their places in the temple at Jerusalem . They must be put in the house of God there .
NIRV	Ezra	6	7	Don ’ t try to stop the work on the temple of God . Let the governor of the Jews and their elders rebuild the house of their God . Let them build it in the same place where it stood before .
NIRV	Ezra	6	8	Here is what I want you to do for the elders of the Jews . Here is how you must help them to build the house of their God . Pay all their expenses from the royal treasures . Use the money you collect from the people who live west of the Euphrates . Don ’ t let the work on the temple stop .
NIRV	Ezra	6	9	Don ’ t fail to give the priests in Jerusalem what they ask for each day . Give them what they need . Give them young bulls , rams and male lambs . The priests can use them to sacrifice burnt offerings to the God of heaven . Also give them wheat , salt , wine and olive oil .
NIRV	Ezra	6	10	Give them those things so they can offer sacrifices that please the God of heaven . And I want them to pray that things will go well for me and my sons .
NIRV	Ezra	6	11	Don ’ t change this order . If anyone tries to change it , they must be put to death . A pole must be pulled from their house . The pole must be stuck through their body . Because that person tried to change my royal order , their house must be broken to pieces .
NIRV	Ezra	6	12	male goats . One goat was sacrificed for each tribe in Israel .
NIRV	Ezra	6	13	The governor Tattenai and Shethar-Bozenai carried out King Darius ’ s order . And so did their friends .
NIRV	Ezra	6	14	The elders of the Jews continued to build the temple . They enjoyed great success because of the preaching of Haggai and Zechariah , the prophets . Zechariah belonged to the family line of Iddo . The people finished building the temple . That ’ s what the God of Israel had commanded them to do . Cyrus and Darius had given orders allowing them to do it . Later , Artaxerxes supplied many things that were needed in the temple . Those three men were kings of Persia .
NIRV	Ezra	6	15	So the temple was completed on the third day of the month of Adar . It was in the sixth year that Darius was king .
NIRV	Ezra	6	16	When the house of God was set apart , the people of Israel celebrated with joy . The priests and Levites joined them . So did the rest of those who had returned from the land of Babylon .
NIRV	Ezra	6	17	When the house of God was set apart to him , the people sacrificed
NIRV	Ezra	6	100	bulls . They also sacrificed
NIRV	Ezra	6	200	rams and
NIRV	Ezra	6	400	male lambs . As a sin offering for the whole nation of Israel , the people sacrificed
NIRV	Ezra	6	18	The priests were appointed to their groups . And the Levites were appointed to their groups . All of them served God at Jerusalem . They served him in keeping with what is written in the Book of Moses . The People Celebrate the Passover Feast
NIRV	Ezra	6	19	The people who had returned from the land of Babylon celebrated the Passover Feast . It was on the 14th day of the first month .
NIRV	Ezra	6	20	The priests and Levites had made themselves pure and “ clean. ” The Levites killed Passover lambs for the people who had returned from Babylon . They also did it for themselves and their relatives , the priests .
NIRV	Ezra	6	21	So the Israelites who had returned ate the Passover lamb . They ate it together with all those who had separated themselves from the practices of their Gentile neighbors . Those practices were “ unclean. ” The people worshiped the Lord . He is the God of Israel .
NIRV	Ezra	6	22	For seven days they celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread with joy . That ’ s because the Lord had filled them with joy . They were glad because he had changed the mind of the king of Persia . So the king had helped them with the work on the house of the God of Israel . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezra	7	9	Ezra had begun his journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month . He arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month . That ’ s because God was gracious to him and helped him .

NIRV	Ezra	7	11	Ezra was a priest and teacher of the Law . He was an educated man . He knew the Lord ’ s commands and rules for Israel very well . Here is a copy of a letter King Artaxerxes had given to Ezra . It said ,

NIRV	Ezra	7	14	I and my seven advisers are sending you to see how things are going in Judah and Jerusalem . Find out whether the people there are obeying the Law of your God . You have a copy of that law with you .
NIRV	Ezra	7	15	I and my advisers have freely given some silver and gold to the God of Israel . He is the God who lives in Jerusalem . Take that silver and gold with you .
NIRV	Ezra	7	16	Also take any other silver and gold you can get from the land of Babylon . And take the offerings the people and priests choose to give for the temple of their God in Jerusalem .
NIRV	Ezra	7	17	Make sure you use the money to buy bulls , rams and male lambs . Also buy their grain offerings and drink offerings . Then sacrifice them on the altar of the temple of your God in Jerusalem .
NIRV	Ezra	7	18	tons of wheat . Give him up to
NIRV	Ezra	7	19	Give to the God of Jerusalem all the things you are responsible for . Use them for worshiping your God in his temple .
NIRV	Ezra	7	20	You might need to supply some other things for the temple of your God . If you do , take them from among the royal treasures .
NIRV	Ezra	7	21	I , King Artaxerxes , also give this order . It applies to all those who are in charge of the treasures west of the Euphrates River . Make sure you provide anything Ezra the priest might ask you to give . He is the teacher of the Law of the God of heaven .

You may not collect them from the priests , Levites or musicians . You may not collect them from those who guard the temple gates . You may not collect them from the temple servants . And you may not collect them from other workers at the house of God in Jerusalem .
NIRV	Ezra	7	25	Ezra , appoint judges and other court officials . When you do it , use the wisdom your God gives you . Those you appoint should do what is right and fair when they judge people . They should do it for everyone who lives west of the Euphrates River . They should do it for everyone who knows the laws of your God . And I want you to teach the people who don ’ t know those laws .
NIRV	Ezra	7	26	Anyone who doesn ’ t obey the law of your God must be punished . The same thing applies to anyone who doesn ’ t obey my law . The people must be punished in keeping with the laws they have broken . Some of them must be put to death . Others must be forced to leave the places where they live . Others must have their property taken away from them . Still others must be put in prison .
NIRV	Ezra	7	27	So here is what I , Ezra , say to you people of Israel . “ Give praise to the Lord . He is the God of our people who lived long ago . He has put it in the king ’ s heart to bring honor to the Lord ’ s temple in Jerusalem . The king has honored the Lord in his letter .
NIRV	Ezra	7	28	The Lord has been kind to me . He has caused the king and his advisers to be kind to me . In fact , all the king ’ s powerful officials have been kind to me .

NIRV	Ezra	8	16	So I sent for Eliezer , Ariel , Shemaiah , Elnathan and Jarib . I also sent for Elnathan , Nathan , Zechariah and Meshullam . All of them were leaders . And I sent for Joiarib and Elnathan . They were very well educated .
NIRV	Ezra	8	17	I ordered all those men to go to Iddo . He was the leader in Kasiphia . He and his Levite relatives were temple servants there . I told my men what to say to them . I wanted Iddo and his Levite relatives to bring some attendants to us for the house of our God .
NIRV	Ezra	8	18	.
NIRV	Ezra	8	19	pounds . I also weighed out two fine objects . The bronze they were made out of was highly polished . They were as priceless as gold .
NIRV	Ezra	8	20	gold bowls . They weighed

NIRV	Ezra	8	21	By the canal that flows toward Ahava , I announced a fast . I told the people not to eat any food . In that way , we made ourselves humble in God ’ s sight . We prayed that he would give us and our children a safe journey . We asked him to keep safe everything we owned .
NIRV	Ezra	8	22	I was ashamed to ask King Artaxerxes for soldiers and horsemen . They could have kept us safe from enemies on the road . But we had told the king that our God would keep us safe . We had said , “ Our God is gracious and helps everyone who looks to him . But he becomes very angry with anyone who deserts him. ”
NIRV	Ezra	8	23	So we didn ’ t eat anything . We prayed to our God about all these matters . And he answered our prayers .
NIRV	Ezra	8	24	tons of silver and gave it to those men . I weighed out almost four tons of silver things . I weighed out almost four tons of gold .

NIRV	Ezra	9	9	We are still slaves . But you are our God . You haven ’ t turned away from us . You haven ’ t left us in our slavery . You have been kind to us . The kings of Persia have seen it . You have given us new life to repair your temple and rebuild it . You have given us a place of safety in Judah and Jerusalem .
NIRV	Ezra	9	2	The men of Israel have married the daughters of some of those people . They ’ ve also taken some of those women for their sons to marry . So they ’ ve mixed our holy nation with the nations around us . We leaders and officials have also married women who don ’ t worship the Lord . By doing this , we have led the way in breaking our covenant with the Lord. ”
NIRV	Ezra	9	3	When I heard that , I tore my inner robe and my coat . I pulled hair from my head and beard . I was so shocked I sat down .
NIRV	Ezra	9	4	Then everyone who trembled with fear at God ’ s words gathered around me . That ’ s because the people who had returned from Babylon had not been faithful . So I was very upset . I just sat there until the time of the evening sacrifice .
NIRV	Ezra	9	5	Then I got up . I had been very sad for quite a while . My inner robe and my coat were torn . I fell down on my knees . I spread my hands out to the Lord my God .
NIRV	Ezra	9	6	I prayed , “ I ’ m filled with shame and dishonor , my God . I can hardly look to you and pray . That ’ s because our sins are piled up above our heads . Our guilt reaches all the way to the heavens .
NIRV	Ezra	9	7	We are filled with it . It has been like that ever since the days of our people who lived long ago . Kings of other countries have killed many of us and our kings and priests with their swords . They ’ ve forced others to leave their own land . They ’ ve taken them away as prisoners . They ’ ve robbed others . They ’ ve made still others feel ashamed and dishonored . All these things have happened to us because we ’ ve committed so many sins . And that ’ s how things still are to this day .
NIRV	Ezra	9	8	“ But you are the Lord our God . Now you have shown us your kindness for a short time . That ’ s because you have allowed a few of us to remain here . Your temple has given us new hope . So you have made things easier for us . You have given us a little rest from our slavery .
NIRV	Ezra	9	10	“ You are our God . What can we say after the way you have blessed us ? We have turned away from your commands .
NIRV	Ezra	9	11	You gave us your commands through your servants the prophets . You said , ‘ You are entering the land to take it as your own . The sinful practices of its people have made the land impure . They have filled it with their “ unclean ” acts from one end to the other . The Lord hates all their practices .
NIRV	Ezra	9	12	So don ’ t let your daughters marry their sons . And don ’ t let their daughters marry your sons . Don ’ t make a peace treaty with them at any time . Then you will be strong . You will eat the good things the land produces . And you will leave all of it to your children as their share . They and their children after them will enjoy it forever. ’
NIRV	Ezra	9	13	“ Our evil acts and our terrible sins have brought about the things that have happened to us . You are our God . Because we sinned so much , you should have punished us even more than you have . But you have left many of your people alive .
NIRV	Ezra	9	14	Suppose we don ’ t obey your commands again . And suppose we continue to marry people who commit sins that you hate . If we do , you will be so angry with us that you will destroy us . You won ’ t leave us even a few people . You won ’ t leave anyone alive .
NIRV	Ezra	9	15	Lord , you are the God of Israel . You are holy . You always do what is right . Today you have left many of your people alive . Here we are with all our guilt . You see the guilt of our sin . Because we have sinned , not one of us can stand in front of you. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezra	10	10	Then Ezra the priest stood up . He said , “ You haven ’ t been faithful to the Lord . You have married women from other lands . So you have added to Israel ’ s guilt .
NIRV	Ezra	10	2	Shekaniah spoke to Ezra . Shekaniah was the son of Jehiel . He belonged to the family line of Elam . Shekaniah said , “ We haven ’ t been faithful to our God . We ’ ve married women from the nations around us . In spite of that , there is still hope for Israel .
NIRV	Ezra	10	3	So let ’ s make a covenant in front of our God . Let ’ s promise to send away all these women and their children . That ’ s what you have advised us to do . Those who respect our God ’ s commands have given us the same advice . We want to do what the Law says .
NIRV	Ezra	10	4	Get up , Ezra . This matter is in your hands . Do what you need to . We will be behind you all the way . Be brave and do it. ”
NIRV	Ezra	10	5	So Ezra got up . He made the leading priests and Levites and all the Israelites make a promise . He made them promise they would do what Shekaniah had suggested . And they made that promise .
NIRV	Ezra	10	6	Then Ezra left the house of God . He went to Jehohanan ’ s room . Jehohanan was the son of Eliashib . While Ezra was there , he didn ’ t eat any food . He didn ’ t drink any water . That ’ s because he was filled with sadness . He mourned because the people weren ’ t faithful to the Lord ’ s commands . Those people were the ones who had returned from the land of Babylon .
NIRV	Ezra	10	7	Then an announcement was sent all through Judah and Jerusalem . All the people who had returned were told to gather together in Jerusalem .
NIRV	Ezra	10	8	They were supposed to come there before three days had passed . If they didn ’ t , they would lose all their property . They would also be removed from the community of those who had returned . That ’ s what the officials and elders had decided .
NIRV	Ezra	10	9	Before the three days were over , all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered together in Jerusalem . It was the 20th day of the ninth month . They were sitting in the open area in front of the house of God . They were very upset by what they knew would happen . And they were upset because it was raining .
NIRV	Ezra	10	11	Now honor the Lord , the God of your people . Then do what he wants you to do . Separate yourselves from the nations around you . Send away your wives from other lands. ”
NIRV	Ezra	10	12	The whole community answered with a loud voice . They said , “ You are right ! We must do as you say .
NIRV	Ezra	10	13	But there are a lot of people here . And it ’ s the rainy season . So we can ’ t stand outside . Besides , this matter can ’ t be taken care of in just a day or two . That ’ s because we have sinned terribly by what we ’ ve done .
NIRV	Ezra	10	14	Our officials can act for the whole community . Have everyone in our towns who has married a woman from another land come at a certain time . Tell them to come together with the elders and judges of each town . Then our God will no longer be angry with us concerning this whole matter. ”
NIRV	Ezra	10	15	Only a few men opposed that . They included Jonathan and Jahzeiah . Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite joined them . Jonathan was the son of Asahel . Jahzeiah was the son of Tikvah .
NIRV	Ezra	10	16	So those who had returned did what had been suggested . Ezra the priest chose some family leaders . There was one from each family group . All of them were chosen by name . They sat down to check out each case . They started on the first day of the tenth month .
NIRV	Ezra	10	17	By the first day of the first month they were finished . They had handled all the cases of the men who had married women from other lands . A List of Those Who Had Married Women From Other Lands
NIRV	Ezra	10	18	Among the family lines of the priests , here are the men who had married women from other lands . Maaseiah , Eliezer , Jarib and Gedaliah came from the family line of Joshua and his brothers . Joshua was the son of Jozadak .
NIRV	Ezra	10	19	All of them made a firm promise to send their wives away . Each of these men brought a ram from his flock as a guilt offering .

NIRV	Nehemiah	1	1	These are the words of Nehemiah . He was the son of Hakaliah . I was in the fort of Susa . I was there in the 20th year that Artaxerxes was king . It was in the month of Kislev .
NIRV	Nehemiah	1	2	At that time Hanani came from Judah with some other men . He was one of my brothers . I asked him and the other men about the Jews who were left alive in Judah . They had returned from Babylon . I also asked him about Jerusalem .
NIRV	Nehemiah	1	3	He and the men with him said to me , “ Some of the people who returned are still alive . They are back in the land of Judah . But they are having a hard time . They are ashamed . The wall of Jerusalem is broken down . Its gates have been burned with fire. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	1	4	When I heard about these things , I sat down and wept . For several days I was very sad . I didn ’ t eat any food . And I prayed to the God of heaven .
NIRV	Nehemiah	1	5	I said , “ Lord , you are the God of heaven . You are a great and wonderful God . You keep the covenant you made with those who love you and obey your commandments . You show them your love .
NIRV	Nehemiah	1	6	Please pay careful attention to my prayer . See how your people are suffering . Please listen to me . I ’ m praying to you day and night . I ’ m praying for the people of Israel . We Israelites have committed sins against you . All of us admit it . I and my family have also sinned against you .
NIRV	Nehemiah	1	7	We ’ ve done some very evil things . We haven ’ t obeyed the commands , rules and laws you gave your servant Moses .
NIRV	Nehemiah	1	8	“ Remember what you told him . You said , ‘ If you people are not faithful , I will scatter you among the nations .
NIRV	Nehemiah	1	9	But if you return to me , I will bring you back . If you obey my commands , I will gather you together again . I will bring you back from the farthest places on earth . I will bring you to the special place where I have chosen to put my Name. ’
NIRV	Nehemiah	1	10	“ Lord , they are your people . They serve you . You used your great strength and mighty hand to set them free from Egypt .
NIRV	Nehemiah	1	11	Lord , please pay careful attention to my prayer . Listen to the prayers of all of us . We take delight in bringing honor to your name . Give me success today when I bring my request to King Artaxerxes. ” I was the king ’ s wine taster . Copyright ©

NIRV	Nehemiah	2	2	So the king asked me , “ Why are you looking so sad ? You aren ’ t sick . You must be feeling very sad. ” I was really afraid .
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	3	But I said to the king , “ May you live forever ! Why shouldn ’ t I look sad ? The city where my people of long ago are buried has been destroyed . And fire has burned up its gates. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	4	The king said to me , “ What do you want ? ” I prayed to the God of heaven .
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	5	Then I answered the king , “ Are you pleased with me , King Artaxerxes ? If it pleases you , send me to Judah . Let me go to the city of Jerusalem . That ’ s where my people are buried . I want to rebuild it. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	6	The queen was sitting beside the king . He turned and asked me , “ How long will your journey take ? When will you get back ? ” It pleased the king to send me . So I chose a certain time .
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	7	I also said to him , “ If it pleases you , may I take some letters with me ? I want to give them to the governors of the land west of the Euphrates River . Then they ’ ll help me travel safely through their territory until I arrive in Judah .
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	8	May I also have a letter to Asaph ? He takes care of the royal park . I want him to give me some logs so I can make beams out of them . I want to use them for the gates of the fort that is by the temple . Some of the logs will also be used in the city wall . And I ’ ll need some for the house I ’ m going to live in. ” God was kind to me and helped me . So the king gave me what I asked for .
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	9	Then I went to the governors of the land west of the Euphrates River . I gave them the king ’ s letters . He had also sent army officers and horsemen along with me .
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	10	Sanballat and Tobiah heard about what was happening . Sanballat was a Horonite . Tobiah was an official from Ammon . They were very upset that someone had come to help the Israelites . Nehemiah Checks Out the Walls of Jerusalem
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	11	I went to Jerusalem and stayed there for three days .
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	12	Then at night I took a few other people with me to check out the walls . I hadn ’ t told anyone what my God wanted me to do for Jerusalem . There weren ’ t any donkeys with me except the one I was riding on .
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	13	That night I went out through the Valley Gate . I went toward the Jackal Well and the Dung Gate . I checked out the walls of Jerusalem . They had been broken down . I also checked the city gates . Fire had burned them up .
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	14	I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the King ’ s Pool . But there wasn ’ t enough room for my donkey to get through .
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	15	It was still night . I went up the Kidron Valley . I kept checking the wall . Finally , I turned back . I went back in through the Valley Gate .
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	16	The officials didn ’ t know where I had gone or what I had done . That ’ s because I hadn ’ t said anything to anyone yet . I hadn ’ t told the priests or nobles or officials . And I hadn ’ t spoken to any other Jews who would be rebuilding the wall .
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	17	I said to them , “ You can see the trouble we ’ re in . Jerusalem has been destroyed . Fire has burned up its gates . Come on . Let ’ s rebuild the wall of Jerusalem . Then people won ’ t be ashamed anymore. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	18	I also told them how my gracious God was helping me . And I told them what the king had said to me . They replied , “ Let ’ s start rebuilding. ” So they began that good work .
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	19	But Sanballat , the Horonite , heard about it . So did Tobiah , the official from Ammon . Geshem , the Arab , heard about it too . All of them laughed at us . They made fun of us . “ What do you think you are doing ? ” they asked . “ Are you turning against the king ? ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	2	20	I answered , “ The God of heaven will give us success . We serve him . So we ’ ll start rebuilding the walls . But you don ’ t have any share in Jerusalem . You don ’ t have any claim to it . You don ’ t have any right to worship here. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Nehemiah	4	4	I prayed to God . I said , “ Our God , please listen to our prayer . Some people hate us . They ’ re saying bad things about us . So let others say bad things about them . Let them be carried off like stolen goods . Let them be taken to another country as prisoners .
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	2	He spoke to his friends and the army of Samaria . He said , “ What are those Jews trying to do ? Can they make their city wall like new again ? Will they offer sacrifices ? Can they finish everything in a single day ? The stones from their city wall and buildings are piled up like trash . And everything has been badly burned . Can they use those stones to rebuild everything again ? ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	3	Tobiah from Ammon was at Sanballat ’ s side . He said , “ What are they building ? They ’ re putting up a stone wall . But suppose a fox climbs on top of it . Even that will break it down ! ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	5	Don ’ t hide your eyes from their guilt . Don ’ t forgive their sins . They have said bad things about the builders. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	6	So we rebuilt the wall . We repaired it until all of it was half as high as we wanted it to be . The people worked with all their heart .
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	7	But Sanballat and Tobiah heard that Jerusalem ’ s walls continued to be repaired . The Arabs , the Ammonites and the people of Ashdod heard about it too . They heard that the gaps in the wall were being filled in . So they were very angry .
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	8	All of them made evil plans to come and fight against Jerusalem . They wanted to stir up trouble against it .
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	9	But we prayed to our God . We put guards on duty day and night to watch out for danger .
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	10	During that time , the people in Judah spoke up . They said , “ The workers are getting weaker and weaker all the time . Broken stones are piled up everywhere . They are in our way . So we can ’ t rebuild the wall. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	11	And our enemies said , “ We will be right there among them . We ’ ll kill them . We ’ ll put an end to their work . We ’ ll do it before they even know it or see us. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	12	Then the Jews who lived near our enemies came to us . They told us ten times , “ No matter where you are , they ’ ll attack us. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	13	So I stationed some people behind the lowest parts of the wall . That ’ s where our enemies could easily attack us . I stationed the people family by family . They had their swords , spears and bows with them .
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	14	I looked things over . Then I stood up and spoke to the nobles , the officials and the rest of the people . I said , “ Don ’ t be afraid of your enemies . Remember the Lord . He is great and powerful . So fight for your families . Fight for your sons and daughters . Fight for your wives and homes. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	15	Our enemies heard that we knew what they were trying to do . They heard that God had blocked their evil plans . So all of us returned to the wall . Each of us did our own work .
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	16	From that day on , half of my men did the work . The other half were given spears , shields , bows and armor . The officers stationed themselves behind all the people of Judah .
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	17	The people continued to build the wall . The people who carried supplies did their work with one hand . They held a weapon in the other hand .
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	18	Each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked . But the man who blew the trumpet stayed with me .
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	19	Then I spoke to the nobles , the officials and the rest of the people . I said , “ This is a big job . It covers a lot of territory . We ’ re separated too far from one another along the wall .
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	20	When you hear the sound of the trumpet , join us at that location . Our God will fight for us ! ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	21	So we continued the work . Half of the men held spears . We worked from the first light of sunrise until the stars came out at night .
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	22	At that time I also spoke to the people . I told them , “ Have every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night . Then they can guard us at night . And they can work during the day. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	4	23	My relatives and I didn ’ t take off our clothes . My men and the guards didn ’ t take theirs off either . Each man kept his weapon with him , even when he went to get water . Copyright ©

NIRV	Nehemiah	5	5	We belong to the same family lines as the rest of our people . Our children are as good as theirs . But we ’ ve had to sell them off as slaves . Some of our daughters have already been made slaves . But we can ’ t do anything about it . That ’ s because our fields and vineyards now belong to others. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	2	Some of them were saying , “ There are now many of us . We have many sons and daughters . We have to get some grain so we can eat and stay alive. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	3	Others were saying , “ We ’ re being forced to sell our fields , vineyards and homes . We have to do it to buy grain . There isn ’ t enough food for everyone. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	4	Still others were saying , “ We ’ ve had to borrow money . We needed it to pay the king ’ s tax on our fields and vineyards .
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	6	I heard them when they cried out . And I was very angry when I heard what they were saying .
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	7	I thought it over for a while . Then I accused the nobles and officials of breaking the law . I told them , “ You are charging your own people interest ! ” So I called together a large group of people to handle the matter .
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	8	I said , “ Our Jewish brothers and sisters were sold to other nations . We ’ ve done everything we could to buy them back and bring them home . But look at what you are doing ! You are actually selling your own people ! Now we ’ ll have to buy them back too ! ” The people kept quiet . They couldn ’ t think of anything to say .
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	9	So I continued , “ What you are doing isn ’ t right . Shouldn ’ t you show respect for our God ? Shouldn ’ t you live in a way that will keep our enemies from saying bad things about us ?
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	10	I ’ m lending the people money and grain . So are my relatives and my men . But we must stop charging interest !
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	11	Give the people ’ s fields back to them . Give them back their vineyards , olive groves and houses . Do it right away . Give everything back to them . Also give them back the one percent on the money , grain , fresh wine and olive oil you have charged them. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	12	years , I and my relatives didn ’ t eat the food that was provided for my table .
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	13	I also shook out my pockets and emptied them . I said , “ Someone might decide not to keep this promise they have made . If that happens , may God shake them out of their house ! May he empty them of everything they own ! ” The whole community said , “ Amen. ” They praised the Lord . And the leaders did what they had promised to do .
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	14	And that ’ s not all . I was appointed as governor of Judah in the 20th year that Artaxerxes was king of Persia . I remained in that position until his 32nd year . During those
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	15	But there had been governors before me . They had put a heavy load on the people . They had taken a pound of silver from each of them . They had also taken food and wine from them . Their officials had acted like high and mighty rulers over them . But because of my great respect for God , I didn ’ t act like that .
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	16	Instead , I spent all my time working on this wall . All my men were gathered there to work on it too . We didn ’ t receive any land for ourselves .
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	17	Many people ate at my table . They included
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	150	Jews and officials . They also included leaders who came to us from the nations that were around us .
NIRV	Nehemiah	5	18	Each day one ox , six of the best sheep and some birds were prepared for me . Every ten days plenty of wine of all kinds was brought in as well . In spite of all that , I never asked for the food that was provided for my table . That ’ s because the people were already paying too many taxes .

NIRV	Nehemiah	6	6	It said , “ A report is going around among the nations . Geshem says it ’ s true . We hear that you and the other Jews are planning to turn against the Persian rulers . And that ’ s why you are building the wall . It ’ s also reported that you are about to become their king .
NIRV	Nehemiah	6	2	Sanballat and Geshem sent me a message . They said , “ Come . Let ’ s talk with one another . Let ’ s meet in one of the villages on the plain of Ono. ” But they were planning to harm me .
NIRV	Nehemiah	6	3	So I sent messengers to them with my answer . I replied , “ I ’ m working on a huge project . So I can ’ t get away . Why should the work stop while I leave it ? Why should I go down and talk with you ? ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	6	4	They sent me the same message four times . And I gave them the same answer each time .
NIRV	Nehemiah	6	5	Sanballat sent his helper to me a fifth time . He brought the same message . He was carrying a letter that wasn ’ t sealed .
NIRV	Nehemiah	6	7	People say that you have even appointed prophets to make an announcement about you . In Jerusalem they are going to say , ‘ Judah has a king ! ’ That report will get back to the king of Persia . So come . Let ’ s meet together. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	6	8	I sent a reply to Sanballat . I said , “ What you are saying isn ’ t really happening . You are just making it up. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	6	9	All of them were trying to frighten us . They thought , “ Their hands will get too weak to do the work . So it won ’ t be completed. ” But I prayed to God . I said , “ Make my hands stronger. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	6	10	One day I went to Shemaiah ’ s house . He was the son of Delaiah . Delaiah was the son of Mehetabel . Shemaiah had shut himself up in his home . He said , “ Let ’ s go to God ’ s house . Let ’ s meet inside the temple and close the doors . Some men are coming at night to kill you. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	6	11	But I said , “ Should a man like me run away ? Should someone like me go into the temple just to save his life ? No ! I won ’ t go ! ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	6	12	I realized that God hadn ’ t sent Shemaiah . Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him . That ’ s why he had prophesied lies about me .
NIRV	Nehemiah	6	13	They had hired him to scare me . They wanted me to commit a sin by doing what he said . That would give me a bad name in the community . People would find fault with me and my work .
NIRV	Nehemiah	6	14	You are my God . Remember what Tobiah and Sanballat have done . Also remember the prophet Noadiah . She and the rest of the prophets have been trying to scare me .

NIRV	Nehemiah	9	27	So you handed them over to their enemies , who treated them badly . Then they cried out to you . From heaven you heard them . You loved them very much . So you sent leaders to help them . The leaders saved them from the power of their enemies .
NIRV	Nehemiah	9	28	“ Then the people were enjoying peace and rest again . That ’ s when they did what you did not want them to do . Then you handed them over to their enemies .

NIRV	Nehemiah	9	29	“ You warned them so that they would obey your law again . But they became proud . They didn ’ t obey your commands . They sinned against your rules . You said , ‘ Anyone who obeys my rules will live by them. ’ But the people didn ’ t care about that . They turned their backs on you . They became very stubborn . They refused to listen to you .
NIRV	Nehemiah	9	30	For many years you put up with them . By your Spirit you warned them through your prophets . In spite of that , they didn ’ t pay any attention . So you handed them over to the nations that were around them .
NIRV	Nehemiah	9	31	But you loved them very much . So you didn ’ t put an end to them . You didn ’ t desert them . That ’ s because you are a gracious God . You are tender and kind .
NIRV	Nehemiah	9	32	“ Our God , you are the great God . You are mighty and wonderful . You keep the covenant you made with us . You show us your love . So don ’ t let all our suffering seem like a small thing to you . We ’ ve suffered greatly . So have our kings and leaders . So have our priests and prophets . Our people who lived long ago also suffered . And all your people are suffering right now . In fact , we ’ ve been suffering from the time of the kings of Assyria until today .
NIRV	Nehemiah	9	33	In spite of everything that has happened to us , you have been fair . You have been faithful in what you have done . But we did what was evil .
NIRV	Nehemiah	9	34	Our kings and leaders didn ’ t follow your law . Our priests and our people before us didn ’ t follow it either . They didn ’ t pay any attention to your commands or rules that you warned them to keep .
NIRV	Nehemiah	9	35	They didn ’ t serve you . They didn ’ t turn from their evil ways . They didn ’ t obey you even when they had a kingdom . You were very good to them . And they enjoyed it . You gave them a rich land . It had plenty of room in it . But they still didn ’ t serve you .
NIRV	Nehemiah	9	36	“ Now look at us . We are slaves today . We ’ re slaves in the land you gave our people of long ago . You gave it to them so they could eat its fruit and the other good things it produces .
NIRV	Nehemiah	9	37	But we have sinned against you . So its great harvest goes to the kings of Persia . You have placed them over us . They rule over our bodies and cattle just as they please . And we are suffering terribly . The People Agree to Obey God ’ s Law

NIRV	Nehemiah	12	44	At that time some men were put in charge of the storerooms . That ’ s where all the gifts the people brought were placed . Those gifts included the first shares of their crops . They also included a tenth of everything the Law required . Crops were harvested from the fields around the towns . The people had to bring the shares of those crops that were required by the Law .

NIRV	Nehemiah	13	13	I put some men in charge of the storerooms . They were Shelemiah , Zadok and Pedaiah . Shelemiah was a priest . Zadok was a teacher of the law . And Pedaiah was a Levite . I made Hanan their assistant . He was the son of Zakkur . Zakkur was the son of Mattaniah . I knew that these men could be trusted . They were put in charge of handing out the supplies to the other Levites .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	2	That ’ s because they hadn ’ t given the people of Israel food and water . Instead , they had hired Balaam to put a curse on them . But our God turned the curse into a blessing .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	3	When that law was read , the people of Judah obeyed it . They sent out of Israel everyone who was from another nation .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	4	Eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms in the house of our God . He had worked closely with Tobiah .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	5	He had also provided a large room for Tobiah . It had been used to store the grain offerings . The incense and the objects for the temple had been put there . And a tenth of the grain , olive oil and fresh wine had been kept there . That ’ s what the Law required for the Levites . That ’ s also what it required for the musicians and the men who guarded the temple gates . The gifts for the priests had been kept there too .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	6	But I wasn ’ t in Jerusalem while all of that was going on . I had returned to the Persian King Artaxerxes , the king of Babylon . I went to him in the 32nd year of his rule . Some time later I asked him to let me return to Jerusalem .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	7	When I got back , I learned about the evil thing Eliashib had done . He had provided a room for Tobiah . It was in the courtyards of God ’ s house .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	8	So I was very unhappy . I threw all of Tobiah ’ s things out of the room .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	9	I gave orders to make the rooms pure and “ clean ” again . Then I put the supplies from God ’ s house back into them . That included the grain offerings and the incense .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	10	I also learned that the shares the Levites were supposed to receive hadn ’ t been given to them . So all the Levites and musicians had to leave their regular temple duties . They had to go back and farm their own fields .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	11	I gave a warning to the officials . I asked them , “ Why aren ’ t you taking care of God ’ s house ? ” Then I brought the Levites and musicians together . I stationed them in their proper places . I put them back to work .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	12	All the people of Judah brought a tenth of the grain , olive oil and fresh wine . They took it to the storerooms .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	14	You are my God . Remember me because of what I ’ ve done . I ’ ve worked faithfully for your temple and its services . So please don ’ t forget the good things I ’ ve done .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	15	In those days I saw some people of Judah stomping on grapes in winepresses . They were doing it on the Sabbath day . Other people were bringing in grain . They were loading it on donkeys . Still other people were loading up wine , grapes , figs and other kinds of things . They were bringing all of it into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day . So I warned them not to sell food on that day .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	16	People from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish . In fact , they were bringing in all kinds of goods . They were selling them in Jerusalem on the Sabbath day . The people of Judah were buying them .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	17	I gave a warning to the nobles of Judah . I said , “ Why are you doing such an evil thing ? You are misusing the Sabbath day !
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	18	Your people of long ago did the very same things . That ’ s why our God has brought all this trouble on us . That ’ s why he ’ s making this city suffer so much . Now you are making him even angrier against Israel . You are misusing the Sabbath day. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	19	Evening shadows fell on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath day started . So I ordered the gates to be shut . They had to remain closed until the Sabbath day was over . I stationed some of my own men at the gates . I told them not to let anything be brought in on the Sabbath day .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	20	Once or twice some traders and sellers spent the night outside Jerusalem . They were hoping to sell all kinds of goods .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	21	But I gave them a warning . I said , “ Why are you spending the night by the wall ? If you do this again , I ’ ll arrest you. ” So from that time on they didn ’ t come on the Sabbath day anymore .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	22	I commanded the Levites to make themselves pure . Then I told them to go and guard the gates . I wanted the Sabbath day to be kept holy . You are my God . Remember me because of the good things I ’ ve done . Be kind to me according to your great love .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	23	In those days I also saw that some men of Judah had married women from Ashdod . Others had married women from Ammon or Moab .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	24	Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod . Or they spoke the language of one of the other nations . They didn ’ t even know how to speak the language of Judah .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	25	So I gave them a warning . I cursed them . I beat up some of them . I pulled their hair out . I had them make a promise in God ’ s name . I said , “ You must promise not to give your daughters to be married to their sons . You must promise not to let their daughters marry your sons . And you must not marry their daughters either .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	26	That ’ s how Solomon , the king of Israel , sinned . He married women from other nations . There wasn ’ t a king like him anywhere . His God loved him . In fact , God made him king over the whole nation of Israel . But even he was led into sin by women from other lands .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	27	Now I hear that you too are doing all of the same terrible and evil things . You aren ’ t being faithful to our God . You are marrying women from other lands. ”
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	28	One of the sons of Joiada was the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite . Joiada , the son of Eliashib , was the high priest . I drove Joiada ’ s son away from me .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	29	You are my God . Remember what those priests have done . They have brought shame to their own work . They have also brought shame to the covenant that God made with the priests and Levites long ago .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	30	So I made the priests and Levites pure . I made them pure from every practice that had come from other countries and had made them impure . I gave them their duties . Each one had his own job to do .
NIRV	Nehemiah	13	31	I also made plans for gifts of wood to be brought at certain appointed times . And I made plans for the first share of the crops to be brought . You are my God . Please remember me with kindness . Copyright ©

NIRV	Esther	1	1	King Xerxes ruled over the
NIRV	Esther	1	127	territories in his kingdom . They reached from India all the way to Cush . Here is what happened during the time Xerxes ruled over the whole Persian kingdom .
NIRV	Esther	1	2	He was ruling from his royal throne in the fort of Susa .
NIRV	Esther	1	3	In the third year of his rule King Xerxes gave a feast . It was for all his nobles and officials . The military leaders of Persia and Media were there . So were the princes and the nobles of the territories he ruled over .
NIRV	Esther	1	4	Every day for
NIRV	Esther	1	180	days he showed his guests the great wealth of his kingdom . He also showed them how glorious his kingdom was .
NIRV	Esther	1	5	When those days were over , the king gave another feast . It lasted for seven days . It was held in the garden of the king ’ s courtyard . It was for all the people who lived in the fort of Susa . Everyone from the least important person to the most important was invited .
NIRV	Esther	1	6	The garden was decorated with white and blue linen banners . They hung from ropes that were made out of white linen and purple cloth . The ropes were connected to silver rings on marble pillars . There were gold and silver couches in the garden . They were placed on a floor that was made out of small stones . The floor had purple crystal , marble , mother-of-pearl and other stones of great value .
NIRV	Esther	1	7	Royal wine was served in gold cups . Each cup was different from all the others . There was plenty of wine . The king always provided as much as his guests wanted .

NIRV	Esther	1	9	Queen Vashti also gave a feast . Only women were invited . It was held in the royal palace of King Xerxes .
NIRV	Esther	1	10	On the seventh day Xerxes was in a good mood because he had drunk a lot of wine . So he gave a command to the seven officials who served him . They were Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , Abagtha , Zethar and Karkas .
NIRV	Esther	1	11	King Xerxes told them to bring Queen Vashti to him . He wanted her to come wearing her royal crown . He wanted to show off her beauty to the people and nobles . She was lovely to look at .
NIRV	Esther	1	12	The attendants told Queen Vashti what the king had ordered her to do . But she refused to come . So the king became very angry .
NIRV	Esther	1	13	It was the king ’ s practice to ask for advice about matters of law and fairness . So he spoke with the wise men who understood what was going on at that time .
NIRV	Esther	1	14	They were the men closest to the king . Their names were Karshena , Shethar , Admatha , Tarshish , Meres , Marsena and Memukan . They were the seven nobles of Persia and Media . They were the king ’ s special advisers and the most important men in the kingdom .
NIRV	Esther	1	15	“ You know the law , ” the king said . “ What should I do to Queen Vashti ? She hasn ’ t obeyed my command . The officials told her what I ordered her to do , didn ’ t they ? ”
NIRV	Esther	1	16	Then Memukan gave a reply to the king and the nobles . He said , “ Queen Vashti has done what is wrong . But she didn ’ t do it only against you , King Xerxes . She did it also against all the nobles . And she did it against the people in all the territories you rule over .
NIRV	Esther	1	17	All the women will hear about what the queen has done . Then they won ’ t respect their husbands . They ’ ll say , ‘ King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought to him . But she wouldn ’ t come. ’
NIRV	Esther	1	18	Here is what will start today . The leading women in Persia and Media who have heard about the queen ’ s actions will act in the same way . They ’ ll disobey all your nobles , just as she disobeyed you . They won ’ t have any respect for their husbands . They won ’ t honor them .
NIRV	Esther	1	19	“ So if it pleases you , send out a royal order . Let it be written down in the laws of Persia and Media . Those laws can never be changed . Let the royal order say that Vashti can never see you again . Also let her position as queen be given to someone who is better than she is .
NIRV	Esther	1	20	And let your order be announced all through your entire kingdom . Then all women will have respect for their husbands , from the least important to the most important. ”
NIRV	Esther	1	21	The king and his nobles were pleased with that advice . So he did what Memukan had suggested .
NIRV	Esther	1	22	The king sent messages out to every territory in the kingdom . He sent them to each territory in its own writing . He sent them to every nation in its own language . The messages announced that every man should rule over his own family , using his own language . Copyright ©

NIRV	Esther	2	2	At that time the king ’ s personal attendants made a suggestion . They said , “ King Xerxes , let a search be made for some beautiful young virgins for you .
NIRV	Esther	2	3	Appoint some officials in every territory in your kingdom . Have them bring all these beautiful young women into the fort of Susa . Put them in the special place where the virgins stay . Then put Hegai in charge of them . He ’ s the official who serves you . He ’ s in charge of the women . Let beauty care be given to the new group of women .
NIRV	Esther	2	4	Then let the young woman who pleases you the most become queen in Vashti ’ s place. ” The king liked that advice . So he followed it .
NIRV	Esther	2	5	There was a Jew living in the fort of Susa . He was from the tribe of Benjamin . His name was Mordecai . He was the son of Jair . Jair was the son of Shimei . Shimei was the son of Kish .
NIRV	Esther	2	6	Nebuchadnezzar had forced Mordecai to leave Jerusalem . He was among the prisoners who were carried off along with Jehoiachin . Jehoiachin had been king of Judah . Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon .
NIRV	Esther	2	7	Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah . He had raised her because she didn ’ t have a father or mother . Hadassah was also called Esther . She had a lovely figure and was very beautiful . Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter . He had done it when her father and mother died .
NIRV	Esther	2	8	After the king ’ s order and law were announced , many young women were brought to the fort of Susa . Hegai was put in charge of them . Esther was also taken to the king ’ s palace . She was put under the control of Hegai . He was in charge of the place where the virgins stayed .
NIRV	Esther	2	9	Esther pleased him . He showed her how happy he was with her . Right away he provided her with her beauty care and special food . He appointed seven female attendants to help her . They were chosen from the king ’ s palace . He moved her and her attendants into the best part of the place where the virgins stayed .
NIRV	Esther	2	10	Esther hadn ’ t told anyone who her people were . She hadn ’ t talked about her family . That ’ s because Mordecai had told her not to .
NIRV	Esther	2	11	Mordecai tried to find out how Esther was getting along . He wanted to know what was happening to her . So he walked back and forth near the courtyard by the place where the virgins stayed . He did it every day .
NIRV	Esther	2	12	months had passed .
NIRV	Esther	2	13	And here is how she would go to the king . She would be given anything she wanted from the place where the virgins stayed . She could take it with her to the king ’ s palace .
NIRV	Esther	2	14	In the evening she would go there . In the morning she would leave . Then she would go to the special place where the king ’ s concubines stayed . She would be put under the control of Shaashgaz . He was the king ’ s official who was in charge of the concubines . She would never return to the king unless he was pleased with her . He had to send for her by name before she could go to him again .
NIRV	Esther	2	15	Mordecai had adopted Esther . She had been the daughter of his uncle Abihail . Her turn came to go in to the king . She only asked for what Hegai suggested . He was the king ’ s official who was in charge of the place where the virgins stayed . Everyone who saw Esther was pleased with her .
NIRV	Esther	2	16	She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal house . It was now the tenth month . That was the month of Tebeth . It was the seventh year of the rule of Xerxes .
NIRV	Esther	2	17	The king liked Esther more than he liked any of the other women . She pleased him more than any of the other virgins . So he put a royal crown on her head . He made her queen in Vashti ’ s place .
NIRV	Esther	2	18	Then the king gave a feast to honor Esther . All his nobles and officials were invited . He announced a holiday all through the territories he ruled over . He freely gave many gifts in keeping with his royal wealth . Mordecai Uncovers a Plan to Kill the King
NIRV	Esther	2	19	The virgins were gathered together a second time . At that time Mordecai was sitting at the palace gate .
NIRV	Esther	2	20	Esther had kept her family history a secret . She hadn ’ t told anyone who her people were . Mordecai had told her not to . She continued to follow his directions . That ’ s what she had always done when he was bringing her up .
NIRV	Esther	2	21	Bigthana and Teresh were two of the king ’ s officers . They guarded the door of the royal palace . They became angry with King Xerxes . So they decided to kill him . They made their evil plans while Mordecai was sitting at the palace gate .
NIRV	Esther	2	22	So Mordecai found out about it and told Queen Esther . Then she reported it to the king . She told him that Mordecai had uncovered the plans against him .
NIRV	Esther	2	23	Some people checked Esther ’ s report . And they found out it was true . So the two officials were put to death . Then poles were stuck through them . They were set up where people could see them . All of that was written in the official records . It was written down while the king was watching . Copyright ©

NIRV	Esther	3	3	The royal officials at the palace gate asked Mordecai a question . They said , “ Why don ’ t you obey the king ’ s command ? ”
NIRV	Esther	3	2	All the royal officials at the palace gate got down on their knees . They gave honor to Haman . That ’ s because the king had commanded them to do it . But Mordecai refused to get down on his knees . He wouldn ’ t give Haman any honor at all .
NIRV	Esther	3	4	Day after day they spoke to him . But he still refused to obey . So they told Haman about it . They wanted to see whether he would let Mordecai get away with what he was doing . Mordecai had told them he was a Jew .
NIRV	Esther	3	5	Haman noticed that Mordecai wouldn ’ t get down on his knees . He wouldn ’ t give Haman any honor . So Haman was very angry .
NIRV	Esther	3	6	But he had found out who Mordecai ’ s people were . So he didn ’ t want to kill only Mordecai . He also looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai ’ s people . They were Jews . He wanted to kill all of them everywhere in the kingdom of Xerxes .
NIRV	Esther	3	7	The lot was cast in front of Haman . The lot was called Pur . It was cast in the first month of the 12th year that Xerxes was king . That month was called Nisan . The lot was cast to choose a day and a month . The month chosen was the 12th month . That month was called Adar .
NIRV	Esther	3	8	Then Haman said to King Xerxes , “ Certain people are scattered among the nations . They live in all the territories in your kingdom . They keep themselves separate from everyone else . Their practices are different from the practices of all other people . They don ’ t obey your laws . It really isn ’ t good for you to put up with them .
NIRV	Esther	3	9	If it pleases you , give the order to destroy them . I ’ ll even add
NIRV	Esther	3	375	tons of silver to the king ’ s officials for the royal treasures. ”
NIRV	Esther	3	10	So the king took his ring off his finger . The ring had his royal seal on it . He gave the ring to Haman . Haman was the son of Hammedatha , the Agagite . Haman was the enemy of the Jews .
NIRV	Esther	3	11	“ Keep the money , ” the king said to Haman . “ Do what you want to with those people. ”
NIRV	Esther	3	12	The king sent for the royal secretaries . It was the 13th day of the first month . The secretaries wrote down all Haman ’ s orders . They wrote them down in the writing of each territory in the kingdom . They also wrote them in the language of each nation . The orders were sent to the royal officials and to the governors of the territories . And the orders were also sent to the nobles of the nations . The orders were written in the name of King Xerxes himself . And they were stamped with his own official mark .
NIRV	Esther	3	13	They were carried by messengers . They were sent to all the king ’ s territories . The orders commanded people to destroy , kill and wipe out all the Jews . That included young people and old people alike . It included women and children . All the Jews were supposed to be killed on a single day . That day was the 13th day of the 12th month . It was the month of Adar . The orders also commanded people to take everything that belonged to the Jews .
NIRV	Esther	3	14	A copy of the order had to be sent out as law . It had to be sent to every territory in the kingdom . It had to be announced to the people of every nation . Then they would be ready for that day .
NIRV	Esther	3	15	The king commanded the messengers to go out . So they did . The order was sent out from the fort of Susa . Then the king and Haman sat down to drink wine . But the people in the city were bewildered . Copyright ©

NIRV	Esther	4	4	Esther ’ s male and female attendants came to her . They told her about Mordecai . So she became very troubled . She wanted him to take off his rough clothing . So she sent him other clothes to wear . But he wouldn ’ t accept them .
NIRV	Esther	4	2	But he only went as far as the palace gate . That ’ s because no one dressed in that rough clothing was allowed to go through it .
NIRV	Esther	4	3	All the Jews were very sad . They didn ’ t eat anything . They wept and cried . Many of them put on the rough clothing people wear when they ’ re sad . They were lying down in ashes . They did all these things in every territory where the king ’ s order and law had been sent .
NIRV	Esther	4	5	Then Esther sent for Hathak . He was one of the king ’ s officials . He had been appointed to take care of her . She ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai . She wanted to know why he was so upset .
NIRV	Esther	4	6	So Hathak went out to see Mordecai . He was in the open area in front of the palace gate .
NIRV	Esther	4	7	Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him . He told him about the exact amount of money Haman had promised to add to the royal treasures . He said Haman wanted it to be used to pay some men to destroy the Jews .
NIRV	Esther	4	8	Mordecai also gave Hathak a copy of the order . It commanded people to wipe out the Jews . The order had been sent from Susa . Mordecai told Hathak to show the order to Esther . He wanted Hathak to explain it to her . Mordecai told him to tell her to go and beg the king for mercy . Mordecai wanted her to make an appeal to the king for her people .
NIRV	Esther	4	9	Hathak went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said .
NIRV	Esther	4	10	Then Esther directed him to give an answer to Mordecai . She told him to say ,
NIRV	Esther	4	11	“ There is a certain law that everyone knows about . All the king ’ s officials know about it . The people in the royal territories know about it . It applies to any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner courtyard without being sent for . It says they must be put to death . But there is a way out . Suppose the king reaches out his gold scepter toward them . Then their lives will be spared . But
NIRV	Esther	4	30	days have gone by since the king sent for me. ”
NIRV	Esther	4	12	Esther ’ s words were reported to Mordecai .
NIRV	Esther	4	13	Then he sent back an answer . He said , “ You live in the king ’ s palace . But don ’ t think that just because you are there you will be the only Jew who will escape .
NIRV	Esther	4	14	What if you don ’ t say anything at this time ? Then help for the Jews will come from another place . But you and your family will die . Who knows ? It ’ s possible that you became queen for a time just like this. ”
NIRV	Esther	4	15	Then Esther sent a reply to Mordecai . She said ,
NIRV	Esther	4	16	“ Go . Gather together all the Jews who are in Susa . And fast for my benefit . Don ’ t eat or drink anything for three days . Don ’ t do it night or day . I and my attendants will fast just as you do . Then I ’ ll go to the king . I ’ ll do it even though it ’ s against the law . And if I have to die , I ’ ll die. ”
NIRV	Esther	4	17	So Mordecai went away . He carried out all Esther ’ s directions . Copyright ©

NIRV	Esther	5	5	“ Bring Haman at once , ” the king said to his servants . “ Then we ’ ll do what Esther asks. ” So the king and Haman went to the feast Esther had prepared .
NIRV	Esther	5	2	He saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard . He was pleased with her . So he reached out toward her the gold scepter that was in his hand . Then Esther approached him . She touched the tip of the scepter .
NIRV	Esther	5	3	The king asked , “ What is it , Queen Esther ? What do you want ? I ’ ll give it to you . I ’ ll even give you up to half of my kingdom. ”
NIRV	Esther	5	4	Esther replied , “ King Xerxes , if it pleases you , come to a feast today . I ’ ve prepared it for you . Please have Haman come with you. ”
NIRV	Esther	5	6	As they were drinking wine , the king asked Esther the same question again . He said , “ What do you want ? I ’ ll give it to you . What do you want me to do for you ? I ’ ll even give you up to half of my kingdom. ”
NIRV	Esther	5	7	Esther replied , “ Here is what I want . Here is my appeal to you .
NIRV	Esther	5	8	I hope you will be pleased to give me what I want . And I hope you will be pleased to listen to my appeal . If you are , I ’ d like you and Haman to come tomorrow to the feast I ’ ll prepare for you . Then I ’ ll answer your question. ” Haman Is Very Angry With Mordecai
NIRV	Esther	5	9	That day Haman was happy . So he left the palace in a good mood . But then he saw Mordecai at the palace gate . He noticed that Mordecai didn ’ t stand up when he walked by . In fact , Mordecai didn ’ t have any respect for him at all . So he was very angry with him .
NIRV	Esther	5	10	But Haman was able to control himself . He went on home . Haman called together his friends and his wife Zeresh .
NIRV	Esther	5	11	He bragged to them about how rich he was . He talked about how many sons he had . He spoke about all the ways the king had honored him . He bragged about how the king had given him a high position . It was higher than the position of any of the other nobles and officials .
NIRV	Esther	5	12	“ And that ’ s not all , ” Haman added . “ I ’ m the only person Queen Esther invited to come with the king to the feast she gave . Now she has invited me along with the king tomorrow .
NIRV	Esther	5	13	But even all of that doesn ’ t satisfy me . I won ’ t be satisfied as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the palace gate. ”
NIRV	Esther	5	14	Haman ’ s wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him , “ Get a pole . In the morning , ask the king to have Mordecai put to death . Have the pole stuck through his body . Set it up at a place where it will be
NIRV	Esther	5	75	feet above the ground . Everyone will be able to see it there . Then go to the feast with the king . Have a good time. ” Haman was delighted with that suggestion . So he got the pole ready . Copyright ©

NIRV	Esther	6	6	Haman entered . Then the king asked him , “ What should be done for the man I want to honor ? ” Haman said to himself , “ Is there anyone the king would rather honor than me ? ”
NIRV	Esther	6	2	What Mordecai had done was written there . He had uncovered the plans of Bigthana and Teresh . They were two of the king ’ s officers who guarded the door of the royal palace . They had decided to kill King Xerxes .
NIRV	Esther	6	3	“ What great honor has Mordecai received for doing that ? ” the king asked . “ Nothing has been done for him , ” his attendants answered .
NIRV	Esther	6	4	The king asked , “ Who is in the courtyard ? ” Haman had just entered the outer courtyard of the palace . He had come to speak to the king about putting Mordecai to death . He wanted to talk about putting Mordecai ’ s body on the pole he had prepared for him .
NIRV	Esther	6	5	The king ’ s attendants said to him , “ Haman is standing in the courtyard. ” “ Bring him in , ” the king ordered .
NIRV	Esther	6	7	So he answered the king . He said , “ Here is what you should do for the man you want to honor .
NIRV	Esther	6	8	Have your servants get a royal robe you have worn . Have them bring a horse you have ridden on . Have a royal mark placed on its head .
NIRV	Esther	6	9	Then give the robe and horse to one of your most noble princes . Let the robe be put on the man you want to honor . Let him be led on the horse through the city streets . Let people announce in front of him , ‘ This is what is done for the man the king wants to honor ! ’ ”
NIRV	Esther	6	10	“ Go right away , ” the king commanded Haman . “ Get the robe . Bring the horse . Do exactly what you have suggested . Do it for Mordecai the Jew . He ’ s sitting out there at the palace gate . Make sure you do everything you have suggested. ”
NIRV	Esther	6	11	So Haman got the robe and the horse . He put the robe on Mordecai . And he led him on horseback through the city streets . He walked along in front of him and announced , “ This is what is done for the man the king wants to honor ! ”
NIRV	Esther	6	12	After that , Mordecai returned to the palace gate . But Haman rushed home . He covered his head because he was very sad .
NIRV	Esther	6	13	He told his wife Zeresh everything that had happened to him . He also told all his friends . His advisers and his wife Zeresh spoke to him . They said , “ Your fall from power started with Mordecai . He ’ s a Jew . So now you can ’ t stand up against him . You are going to be destroyed ! ”
NIRV	Esther	6	14	They were still talking with him when the king ’ s officials arrived . They hurried Haman away to the feast Esther had prepared . Copyright ©

NIRV	Esther	7	7	The king got up . He was very angry . He left his wine and went out into the palace garden . But Haman realized that the king had already decided what he was going to do to him . So he stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life .
NIRV	Esther	7	2	They were drinking wine on the second day . The king again asked , “ What do you want , Queen Esther ? I ’ ll give it to you . What do you want me to do for you ? I ’ ll even give you up to half of my kingdom. ”
NIRV	Esther	7	3	Then Queen Esther answered , “ Your Majesty , I hope you will be pleased to let me live . That ’ s what I want . Please spare my people . That ’ s my appeal to you .
NIRV	Esther	7	4	My people and I have been sold to be destroyed . We ’ ve been sold to be killed and wiped out . Suppose we had only been sold as male and female slaves . Then I wouldn ’ t have said anything . That kind of suffering wouldn ’ t be a good enough reason to bother you. ”
NIRV	Esther	7	5	King Xerxes asked Queen Esther , “ Who is the man who has dared to do such a thing ? And where is he ? ”
NIRV	Esther	7	6	Esther said , “ The man hates us ! He ’ s our enemy ! He ’ s this evil Haman ! ” Then Haman was terrified in front of the king and queen .
NIRV	Esther	7	8	The king returned from the palace garden to the dinner hall . Just then he saw Haman falling on the couch where Esther was lying . The king shouted , “ Will he even treat the queen like this ? Will he harm her while she ’ s right here with me in the palace ? ” As soon as the king finished speaking , his men covered Haman ’ s face .
NIRV	Esther	7	9	Then Harbona said , “ There ’ s a pole standing near Haman ’ s house . He has prepared it for Mordecai . Mordecai is the one who spoke up to help you . Haman had planned to have him put to death . He was going to have the pole stuck through his body . Then he was going to set it up at a place where it would be
NIRV	Esther	7	75	feet above the ground. ” Harbona was one of the officials who attended the king . The king said to his men , “ Put Haman to death ! Stick the pole through his body ! Set it up where everyone can see it ! ”
NIRV	Esther	7	10	So they did . And they used the pole Haman had prepared for Mordecai . Then the king ’ s anger calmed down . Copyright ©

NIRV	Esther	8	8	Now write another order in my name . Do it for the benefit of the Jews . Do what seems best to you . Stamp the order with my royal mark . Nothing that is written in my name and stamped with my mark can ever be changed. ”
NIRV	Esther	8	2	The king took his ring off . It had his royal mark on it . He had taken it back from Haman . Now he gave it to Mordecai . And Esther put Mordecai in charge of everything Haman had owned .
NIRV	Esther	8	3	Esther made another appeal to the king . She fell at his feet and wept . She begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman , the Agagite . He had decided to kill the Jews .
NIRV	Esther	8	4	The king reached out his gold scepter toward Esther . She got up and stood in front of him .
NIRV	Esther	8	5	She said , “ King Xerxes , I hope you will think what I ’ m asking is the right thing to do . I hope you are pleased with me . If you are , and if it pleases you , let an order be written . Let it take the place of the messages Haman wrote . Haman was the son of Hammedatha , the Agagite . He planned to kill the Jews . He wrote orders to destroy us in all your territories .
NIRV	Esther	8	6	I couldn ’ t stand by and see the horrible trouble that would fall on my people ! I couldn ’ t stand to see my family destroyed ! ”
NIRV	Esther	8	7	King Xerxes gave a reply to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew . He said , “ Haman attacked the Jews . So I ’ ve given Esther everything he owned . My men have stuck a pole through his dead body . And they ’ ve set it up where everyone can see it .
NIRV	Esther	8	9	Right away the king sent for the royal secretaries . It was the 23rd day of the third month . That was the month of Sivan . They wrote down all Mordecai ’ s orders to the Jews . They also wrote them to the royal officials , the governors and the nobles of the
NIRV	Esther	8	127	territories in his kingdom . The territories reached from India all the way to Cush . The orders were written down in the writing of each territory . They were written in the language of each nation . They were also written to the Jews in their own writing and language .
NIRV	Esther	8	10	Mordecai wrote the orders in the name of King Xerxes . He stamped them with the king ’ s royal mark . He sent them by messengers on horseback . They rode fast horses that were raised just for the king .
NIRV	Esther	8	11	The Jews in every city could now gather together and fight for their lives . The king ’ s order gave them that right . But suppose soldiers from any nation or territory attacked them , their women or children . Then the Jews could destroy , kill and wipe out those soldiers . They could also take the goods that belonged to their enemies .
NIRV	Esther	8	12	A day was appointed for the Jews to do that in all the king ’ s territories . It was the 13th day of the 12th month . That was the month of Adar .
NIRV	Esther	8	13	A copy of the order was sent out as law in every territory . It was announced to the people of every nation . So the Jews would be ready on that day . They could pay back their enemies .
NIRV	Esther	8	14	The messengers rode on the royal horses . They raced along . That ’ s what the king commanded them to do . The order was also sent out in the fort of Susa . The Jews Win the Battle Over Their Enemies
NIRV	Esther	8	15	Mordecai left the king and went on his way . Mordecai was wearing royal clothes when he went . They were blue and white . He was also wearing a large gold crown . And he was wearing a purple coat . It was made out of fine linen . The city of Susa celebrated with great joy .
NIRV	Esther	8	16	The Jews were filled with joy and happiness . They were very glad because now they were being honored .
NIRV	Esther	8	17	They celebrated and enjoyed good food . They were glad and full of joy . That was true everywhere the king ’ s order came . It was true in every territory and every city . Many people from other nations announced that they had become Jews . That ’ s because they were so afraid of the Jews . Copyright ©

NIRV	Esther	9	2	The Jews gathered together in their cities . They gathered in all the territories King Xerxes ruled over . They came together to attack those who were trying to destroy them . No one could stand up against them . The people from all the other nations were afraid of them .
NIRV	Esther	9	3	All the nobles in the territories helped the Jews . So did the royal officials , the governors and the king ’ s officers . That ’ s because they were so afraid of Mordecai .
NIRV	Esther	9	4	He was well known in the palace . His fame spread all through the territories . So he became more and more important .
NIRV	Esther	9	5	The Jews struck down with swords all their enemies . They killed them and destroyed them . They did what they pleased to those who hated them .
NIRV	Esther	9	6	The Jews killed
NIRV	Esther	9	500	men . They destroyed them in the fort of Susa . They also killed the ten sons of Haman there . What have they done in the rest of my territories ? Now what do you want ? I ’ ll give it to you . What do you want me to do for you ? I ’ ll do that too. ”
NIRV	Esther	9	7	They also killed Parshandatha , Dalphon , Aspatha ,
NIRV	Esther	9	8	Poratha , Adalia , Aridatha ,
NIRV	Esther	9	10	They were the ten sons of Haman . He was the son of Hammedatha . Haman had been the enemy of the Jews . They didn ’ t take anything that belonged to their enemies .
NIRV	Esther	9	11	A report was brought to the king that same day . He was told how many men had been killed in the fort of Susa .
NIRV	Esther	9	12	He said to Queen Esther , “ The Jews have killed
NIRV	Esther	9	13	“ If it pleases you , ” Esther answered , “ let the Jews in Susa carry out today ’ s order tomorrow also . Stick poles through the dead bodies of Haman ’ s ten sons . Set them up where everyone can see them. ”
NIRV	Esther	9	14	So the king commanded that it be done . An order was sent out in Susa . And the king ’ s men did to the bodies of Haman ’ s sons everything they were told to do .
NIRV	Esther	9	15	The Jews in Susa came together on the 14th day of the month of Adar . They put
NIRV	Esther	9	300	men to death in Susa . But they didn ’ t take anything that belonged to those men .
NIRV	Esther	9	16	During that time , the rest of the Jews also gathered together . They lived in the king ’ s territories . They came together to fight for their lives . They didn ’ t want their enemies to bother them anymore . They wanted to get some peace and rest . So they killed 75,000 of their enemies . But they didn ’ t take anything that belonged to them .
NIRV	Esther	9	17	It happened on the 13th of Adar . On the 14th day they rested . They made it a day to celebrate with great joy . And they enjoyed good food .
NIRV	Esther	9	18	But the Jews in Susa had gathered together on the 13th and 14th . Then on the 15th they rested . They made it a day to celebrate with great joy . And they enjoyed good food .
NIRV	Esther	9	19	That ’ s why Jews who live out in the villages celebrate on the 14th of Adar . They celebrate that day with great joy . And they enjoy good food . They also give presents to each other on that day . Purim Is Celebrated
NIRV	Esther	9	20	Mordecai wrote down these events . He sent letters to all the Jews all through the territories of King Xerxes . It didn ’ t matter whether the Jews lived nearby or far away .
NIRV	Esther	9	21	Mordecai told them to celebrate the 14th and 15th days of the month of Adar . He wanted them to do it every year .
NIRV	Esther	9	22	Mordecai told the Jews to celebrate the time when they got rest from their enemies . That was the month when their sadness was turned into joy . It was when their weeping turned into a day for celebrating . He wrote the letters to celebrate those days as times of joy . He wanted the people to enjoy good food . He told them to give presents of food to one another . He also wanted them to give gifts to people who were poor .
NIRV	Esther	9	23	So the Jews agreed to continue the celebrating they had started . They kept doing what Mordecai had written to them .
NIRV	Esther	9	24	Haman was the son of Hammedatha , the Agagite . He had been the enemy of all the Jews . He had planned to destroy them . He had cast the lot to destroy them completely . The lot was called Pur .
NIRV	Esther	9	25	But the king had found out about Haman ’ s evil plan . So the king had sent out written orders . He had ordered that Haman ’ s evil plan against the Jews should happen to him instead . The king also commanded that poles be stuck through the dead bodies of Haman and his sons . Then they should be set up where everyone could see them .
NIRV	Esther	9	26	The days the Jews were celebrating were called Purim . Purim comes from the word Pur . Pur means Lot . Now the Jews celebrate these two days every year . They do it because of everything that was written in Mordecai ’ s letter . They also do it because of what they had seen and what had happened to them .
NIRV	Esther	9	27	So they established it as a regular practice . They decided they would always observe these two days of the year . They would celebrate in the required way . And they would celebrate at the appointed time . They and their children after them would always observe these days . And so would all who join them .
NIRV	Esther	9	28	The days should be remembered and celebrated . They should be remembered by every family for all time to come . They should be celebrated in every territory and in every city . The Jews should never stop celebrating the days of Purim . Their children after them should always remember these days .
NIRV	Esther	9	29	So Queen Esther , the daughter of Abihail , wrote a second letter . She wrote it together with Mordecai the Jew . They wanted to give their full authority to this second letter about Purim .
NIRV	Esther	9	30	Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in the
NIRV	Esther	9	127	territories of the kingdom of Xerxes . The letters had messages of kindness and hope in them .
NIRV	Esther	9	31	The letters established the days of Purim at their appointed times . They spoke about what Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had ordered the people to do . Everything should be done in keeping with the directions the Jews had set up for themselves and their children after them . The directions applied to their times of fasting and sadness .
NIRV	Esther	9	32	Esther ’ s order established the rules about Purim . It was written down in the records . Copyright ©

NIRV	Esther	10	10	King Xerxes required people all through his kingdom to bring gifts . King Xerxes required gifts from its farthest shores .
NIRV	Esther	10	2	All the king ’ s powerful and mighty acts are written down . That includes the whole story of how important Mordecai was . The king had given him a position of great honor . All these things are written in the official records of the kings of Media and Persia .
NIRV	Esther	10	3	The position of Mordecai the Jew was second only to the position of King Xerxes . Mordecai was the most important Jew . All the other Jews had the highest respect for him . That ’ s because he worked for the good of his people . And he spoke up for the benefit of all the Jews . Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	1	1	There was a man who lived in the land of Uz . His name was Job . He was honest . He did what was right . He had respect for God and avoided evil .
NIRV	Job	1	2	Job had seven sons and three daughters .
NIRV	Job	1	3	He owned 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels . He owned
NIRV	Job	1	500	donkeys . He also had a large number of servants . He was the most important man among all the people in the east .
NIRV	Job	1	4	His sons used to give feasts in their homes on their birthdays . They would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them .
NIRV	Job	1	5	The time for enjoying good food would end . Then Job would make plans for his children to be made pure and “ clean. ” He would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them . He would do it early in the morning . He would think , “ Perhaps my children have sinned . Maybe they have spoken evil things against God in their hearts. ” That ’ s what Job always did for his children when he felt they had sinned .
NIRV	Job	1	6	One day angels came to the Lord . Satan also came with them .
NIRV	Job	1	7	The Lord said to Satan , “ Where have you come from ? ” Satan answered , “ From traveling all around the earth . I ’ ve been going from one end of it to the other. ”
NIRV	Job	1	8	Then the Lord said to Satan , “ Have you thought about my servant Job ? There isn ’ t anyone on earth like him . He is honest . He does what is right . He has respect for God and avoids evil. ”
NIRV	Job	1	9	“ You always give Job everything he needs , ” Satan replied . “ That ’ s why he has respect for you .
NIRV	Job	1	10	Haven ’ t you guarded him and his family ? Haven ’ t you taken care of everything he has ? You have blessed everything he does . His flocks and herds are spread all through the land .
NIRV	Job	1	11	But now reach out your hand and strike down everything he has . Then I ’ m sure he will speak evil things against you . In fact , he ’ ll do it right in front of you. ”
NIRV	Job	1	12	The Lord said to Satan , “ All right . I am handing everything he has over to you . But do not touch the man himself. ” Then Satan left the Lord and went on his way .
NIRV	Job	1	13	One day Job ’ s sons and daughters were at their oldest brother ’ s house . They were enjoying good food and drinking wine .
NIRV	Job	1	14	During that time a messenger came to Job . He said , “ The oxen were plowing . The donkeys were eating grass near them .
NIRV	Job	1	15	Then the Sabeans attacked us and carried off the animals . They killed some of the servants with their swords . I ’ m the only one who has escaped to tell you ! ”
NIRV	Job	1	16	While he was still speaking , a second messenger came . He said , “ God sent lightning from the sky . It struck the sheep and killed them . It burned up some of the servants . I ’ m the only one who has escaped to tell you ! ”
NIRV	Job	1	17	While he was still speaking , a third messenger came . He said , “ The Chaldeans separated themselves into three groups . They attacked your camels and carried them off . They killed the rest of the servants with their swords . I ’ m the only one who has escaped to tell you ! ”
NIRV	Job	1	18	While he was still speaking , a fourth messenger came . He said , “ Your sons and daughters were at their oldest brother ’ s house . They were enjoying good food and drinking wine .
NIRV	Job	1	19	Suddenly a strong wind blew in from the desert . It struck the four corners of the house . The house fell down on your children . Now all of them are dead . I ’ m the only one who has escaped to tell you ! ”
NIRV	Job	1	20	After Job heard all these reports , he got up and tore his robe . He shaved his head . Then he fell to the ground and worshiped the Lord .
NIRV	Job	1	21	He said , “ I was born naked . And I ’ ll leave here naked . The Lord has given , and the Lord has taken away . May the name of the Lord be praised. ”
NIRV	Job	1	22	In spite of everything , Job didn ’ t sin by blaming God for doing anything wrong . Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	2	2	The Lord said to Satan , “ Where have you come from ? ” Satan answered , “ From traveling all around the earth . I ’ ve been going from one end of it to the other. ”
NIRV	Job	2	3	Then the Lord said to Satan , “ Have you thought about my servant Job ? There isn ’ t anyone on earth like him . He is honest . He does what is right . He has respect for God and avoids evil . You tried to turn me against him . You wanted me to destroy him without any reason . But he still continues to be faithful. ”
NIRV	Job	2	4	Satan replied , “ A man will give everything he has to save himself . So Job is willing to give up the lives of his family to save his own life .
NIRV	Job	2	5	But now reach out your hand and strike his flesh and bones . Then I ’ m sure he will speak evil things against you . In fact , he ’ ll do it right in front of you. ”
NIRV	Job	2	6	The Lord said to Satan , “ All right . I am handing him over to you . But you must spare his life. ”
NIRV	Job	2	7	Then Satan left the Lord and went on his way . He sent painful sores on Job . They covered him from the bottom of his feet to the top of his head .
NIRV	Job	2	8	He got part of a broken pot . He used it to scrape his skin . He did it while he was sitting in ashes .
NIRV	Job	2	9	His wife said to him , “ Are you still continuing to be faithful to the Lord ? Speak evil things against him and die ! ”
NIRV	Job	2	10	Job replied , “ You are talking like a foolish woman . We accept good things from God . So we should also accept trouble when he sends it. ” In spite of everything , Job didn ’ t say anything that was sinful .
NIRV	Job	2	11	Job had three friends named Eliphaz the Temanite , Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite . They heard about all the troubles that had come to Job . So they started out from their homes . They had agreed to meet together . They wanted to go and show their concern for Job . They wanted to comfort him .
NIRV	Job	2	12	When they got closer to where he lived , they could see him . But they could hardly recognize him . They began to weep out loud . They tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads .
NIRV	Job	2	13	Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights . No one said a word to him . That ’ s because they saw how much he was suffering . Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	3	3	“ May the day I was born be wiped out . May the night be wiped away when people said , ‘ A boy is born ! ’
NIRV	Job	3	2	He said ,
NIRV	Job	3	4	May that day turn into darkness . May God in heaven not care about it . May no light shine on it .
NIRV	Job	3	5	May gloom and total darkness take it back . May a cloud settle over it . May blackness cover it up .
NIRV	Job	3	6	May deep darkness take over the night I was born . May it not be included among the days of the year . May it never appear in any of the months .
NIRV	Job	3	7	May no children ever have been born on that night . May no shout of joy be heard in it .
NIRV	Job	3	8	May people say evil things about that day . May people ready to wake the sea monster Leviathan say evil things about that day .
NIRV	Job	3	9	May its morning stars become dark . May it lose all hope of ever seeing daylight . May it not see the first light of the morning sun .
NIRV	Job	3	10	It didn ’ t keep my mother from letting me be born . It didn ’ t keep my eyes from seeing trouble .
NIRV	Job	3	11	“ Why didn ’ t I die when I was born ? Why didn ’ t I die as I came out of my mother ’ s body ?
NIRV	Job	3	12	Why was I placed on her knees ? Why did her breasts give me milk ?
NIRV	Job	3	13	If all of that hadn ’ t happened , I would be lying down in peace . I ’ d be asleep and at rest in the grave .
NIRV	Job	3	14	I ’ d be with the earth ’ s kings and rulers . They had built for themselves places that are now destroyed .
NIRV	Job	3	15	I ’ d be with princes who used to have gold . They had filled their houses with silver .
NIRV	Job	3	16	Why wasn ’ t I buried like a baby who was born dead ? Why wasn ’ t I buried like a child who never saw the light of day ?
NIRV	Job	3	17	In the grave , sinful people don ’ t cause trouble anymore . And there tired people find rest .
NIRV	Job	3	18	Prisoners also enjoy peace there . They don ’ t hear a slave driver shouting at them anymore .
NIRV	Job	3	19	The least important and most important people are there . And there the slaves are set free from their owners .
NIRV	Job	3	20	“ Why should those who suffer ever be born ? Why should life be given to those whose spirits are bitter ?
NIRV	Job	3	21	Why is life given to those who long for death that doesn ’ t come ? Why is it given to those who would rather search for death than for hidden treasure ?
NIRV	Job	3	22	Why is life given to those who are actually happy and glad when they reach the grave ?
NIRV	Job	3	23	Why is life given to a man like me ? God hasn ’ t told me what will happen to me . He has surrounded me with nothing but trouble .
NIRV	Job	3	24	Sighs have become my food every day . Groans pour out of me like water .
NIRV	Job	3	25	What I was afraid of has come on me . What I worried about has happened to me .
NIRV	Job	3	26	I don ’ t have any peace and quiet . I can ’ t find any rest . All I have is trouble. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	4	4	Your words helped those who had fallen down . You made shaky knees strong .
NIRV	Job	4	2	“ Job , suppose someone tries to talk to you . Will that make you uneasy ? I can ’ t keep from speaking up .
NIRV	Job	4	3	Look , you taught many people . You made weak hands strong .
NIRV	Job	4	5	Now trouble comes to you . And you are unhappy about it . It strikes you down . And you are afraid .
NIRV	Job	4	6	Shouldn ’ t you worship God and trust in him ? Shouldn ’ t your honest life give you hope ?
NIRV	Job	4	7	“ Here ’ s something to think about . Have people who aren ’ t guilty ever been wiped out ? Have honest people ever been completely destroyed ?
NIRV	Job	4	8	Here ’ s what I ’ ve observed . People gather a crop from what they plant . If they plant evil and trouble , that ’ s what they will harvest .
NIRV	Job	4	9	The breath of God destroys them . The blast of his anger wipes them out .
NIRV	Job	4	10	Powerful lions might roar and growl . But their teeth are broken .
NIRV	Job	4	11	Lions die because they don ’ t have any food . Then their cubs are scattered .
NIRV	Job	4	12	“ A message came to me in secret . It was as quiet as a whisper .
NIRV	Job	4	13	I had a scary dream one night . I was sound asleep .
NIRV	Job	4	14	Fear and trembling seized me . That made every bone in my body shake .
NIRV	Job	4	15	A spirit glided past my face . The hair on my body stood on end .
NIRV	Job	4	16	Then the spirit stopped . But I couldn ’ t tell what it was . Something stood there in front of me . I heard a soft voice .
NIRV	Job	4	17	It said , ‘ Can a human being be more right than God ? Can even a strong man be more pure than the God who made him ?
NIRV	Job	4	18	God doesn ’ t trust those who serve him . He even brings charges against his angels .
NIRV	Job	4	19	So he ’ ll certainly find fault with human beings . After all , they are made out of dust . They can be crushed more easily than a moth .
NIRV	Job	4	20	Between sunrise and sunset they are broken to pieces . Nobody even notices . They disappear forever .
NIRV	Job	4	21	Like a tent that falls down , they get weak . They die because they didn ’ t follow God ’ s wisdom. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	5	5	Hungry people eat up the crops of the foolish . They even take the food that grows among thorns . Thirsty people long for the wealth of the foolish .
NIRV	Job	5	2	Anger kills foolish people . Jealousy destroys those who are childish .
NIRV	Job	5	3	I saw that foolish people were having success . But suddenly harm came to their their homes .
NIRV	Job	5	4	Their children aren ’ t safe at all . They lose their case in court . No one speaks up for them .
NIRV	Job	5	6	Hard times don ’ t just grow out of the soil . Trouble doesn ’ t jump out of the ground .
NIRV	Job	5	7	People are born to have trouble . And that ’ s just as sure as sparks fly up .
NIRV	Job	5	8	“ If I were you , I ’ d make my appeal to God . I ’ d bring my case to be judged by him .
NIRV	Job	5	9	He does wonderful things that can ’ t be understood . He does miracles that can ’ t even be counted .
NIRV	Job	5	10	He sends rain on the earth . He sends water on the countryside .
NIRV	Job	5	11	He lifts up people who are lowly in spirit . He lifts up those who are sad . He keeps them safe .
NIRV	Job	5	12	He stops the evil plans of those who are clever . The work of their hands doesn ’ t succeed .
NIRV	Job	5	13	Some people think they are so wise . But God catches them in their own tricks . He sweeps away the evil plans of sinful people .
NIRV	Job	5	14	Darkness covers them in the daytime . At noon they feel their way around as if it were night .
NIRV	Job	5	15	God saves needy people from the cutting words of their enemies . He saves them from their power .
NIRV	Job	5	16	So poor people have hope . And God shuts the mouths of those who don ’ t treat others fairly .
NIRV	Job	5	17	“ Blessed is the person God corrects . So don ’ t hate the Mighty One ’ s training .
NIRV	Job	5	18	He wounds . But he also bandages up those he wounds . He harms . But his hands also heal those he harms .
NIRV	Job	5	19	From six troubles he will save you . Even if you are in trouble seven times , no harm will come to you .
NIRV	Job	5	20	When there isn ’ t enough food , God will keep you from dying . When you go into battle , he won ’ t let a sword strike you down .
NIRV	Job	5	21	He will keep you safe from words that can hurt you . You won ’ t need to be afraid when everything is being destroyed .
NIRV	Job	5	22	You will laugh when things are being destroyed . You will enjoy life even when there isn ’ t enough food . You won ’ t be afraid of wild animals .
NIRV	Job	5	23	You will make a covenant with the stones in the fields . They won ’ t keep your crops from growing . Even wild animals will be at peace with you .
NIRV	Job	5	24	You will know that the tent you live in is secure . You will check out your property . You will see that nothing is missing .
NIRV	Job	5	25	You can be sure you will have a lot of children . They will be as many as the blades of grass on the earth .
NIRV	Job	5	26	You will go down to the grave while you are still very strong . You will be like a crop that is gathered at the right time .

NIRV	Job	6	6	Is food that doesn ’ t have any taste eaten without salt ? Is there any flavor in the sap of a mallow plant ?
NIRV	Job	6	2	“ I wish my great pain could be weighed ! I wish all my suffering could be weighed on scales !
NIRV	Job	6	3	I ’ m sure it would weigh more than the grains of sand on the seashore . No wonder I ’ ve been so quick to speak !
NIRV	Job	6	4	The Mighty One has shot me with his arrows . I have to drink their poison . God ’ s terrors are aimed at me .
NIRV	Job	6	5	Does a wild donkey cry out when it has enough grass ? Does an ox call out when it has plenty of food ?
NIRV	Job	6	7	I refuse to touch that kind of food . It makes me sick .
NIRV	Job	6	8	“ I wish I could have what I ’ m asking for ! I wish God would give me what I ’ m hoping for !
NIRV	Job	6	9	I wish he would crush me ! I wish he would just cut off my life !
NIRV	Job	6	10	Then I ’ d still have one thing to comfort me . It would be that I haven ’ t said no to the Holy One ’ s commands . That would give me joy in spite of my pain that never ends .

NIRV	Job	6	13	I don ’ t have the power to help myself . All hope of success has been taken away from me .
NIRV	Job	6	14	“ A person shouldn ’ t stop being kind to a friend . Anyone who does that stops showing respect for the Mighty One .
NIRV	Job	6	15	But my friends have stopped being kind to me . They are like streams that only flow for part of the year . They are like rivers that flow over their banks
NIRV	Job	6	16	when the ice begins to break up . The streams rise when the snow starts to melt .
NIRV	Job	6	17	But they stop flowing when the dry season comes . They disappear from their stream beds when the weather warms up .
NIRV	Job	6	18	Groups of traders turn away from their usual paths . They go off into the dry and empty land . And they die there .
NIRV	Job	6	19	Traders from Tema look for water . Traveling merchants from Sheba also hope to find it .
NIRV	Job	6	20	They become troubled because they had expected to find some . But when they arrive at the stream beds , they don ’ t find any water at all .
NIRV	Job	6	21	And now , my friends , you haven ’ t helped me either . You see the horrible condition I ’ m in . And that makes you afraid .
NIRV	Job	6	22	I ’ ve never said , ‘ Give me something to help me . Use your wealth to set me free .

NIRV	Job	7	7	God , remember that my life is only a breath . I ’ ll never be happy again .
NIRV	Job	7	2	I ’ ve been like a slave who longs for the evening shadows to come . I ’ ve been like a hired worker who is waiting to be paid .
NIRV	Job	7	3	I ’ ve been given several months that were useless to me . My nights have been filled with suffering .
NIRV	Job	7	4	When I lie down I think , ‘ How long will it be before I can get up ? ’ The night drags on . I toss and turn until sunrise .

NIRV	Job	7	6	“ My days pass by faster than a weaver can work . They come to an end . I don ’ t have any hope .
NIRV	Job	7	8	The eyes that see me now won ’ t see me anymore . You will look for me . But I ’ ll be gone .
NIRV	Job	7	9	When a cloud disappears , it ’ s gone forever . And anyone who goes down to the grave never returns .
NIRV	Job	7	10	He never comes home again . Even his own family doesn ’ t remember him .
NIRV	Job	7	11	“ So I won ’ t keep quiet . When I ’ m suffering greatly , I ’ ll speak out . When my spirit is bitter , I ’ ll tell you how unhappy I am .
NIRV	Job	7	12	Am I the ocean ? Am I the sea monster ? If I ’ m not , why do you guard me so closely ?
NIRV	Job	7	13	Sometimes I think my bed will comfort me . I think my couch will keep me from being unhappy .
NIRV	Job	7	14	But even then you send me dreams that frighten me . You send me visions that terrify me .
NIRV	Job	7	15	So I would rather choke to death . That would be better than living in this body of mine .
NIRV	Job	7	16	I hate my life . I don ’ t want to live forever . Leave me alone . My days don ’ t mean anything to me .
NIRV	Job	7	17	“ What are human beings that you think so much of them ? What are they that you pay so much attention to them ?
NIRV	Job	7	18	You check up on them every morning . You test them every moment .

NIRV	Job	8	10	Won ’ t your people of long ago teach you and tell you ? Won ’ t the things they said help you understand ?
NIRV	Job	8	11	Can grass grow tall where there isn ’ t any swamp ? Can plants grow well where there isn ’ t any water ?
NIRV	Job	8	12	While they are still growing and haven ’ t been cut , they dry up faster than grass does .
NIRV	Job	8	13	The same thing happens to everyone who forgets God . The hope of ungodly people dies out .
NIRV	Job	8	14	What they trust in is very weak . What they depend on is like a spider ’ s web .
NIRV	Job	8	15	They lean on it , but it falls apart . They hold on to it , but it gives way .
NIRV	Job	8	16	They are like a plant in the sunshine that receives plenty of water . It spreads its new growth all over the garden .
NIRV	Job	8	17	It wraps its roots around a pile of rocks . It tries to find places to grow among the stones .
NIRV	Job	8	18	But when the plant is pulled up from its spot , that place says , ‘ I never saw you. ’
NIRV	Job	8	19	The life of that plant is sure to dry up . But from the same soil other plants will grow .
NIRV	Job	8	20	“ I ’ m sure God doesn ’ t turn his back on anyone who is honest . And he doesn ’ t help those who do what is evil .
NIRV	Job	8	21	He will fill your mouth with laughter . Shouts of joy will come from your lips .
NIRV	Job	8	22	Your enemies will put on shame as if it were clothes . The tents of sinful people will be gone. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	9	9	He made the Big Dipper and Orion . He created the Pleiades and the southern stars .
NIRV	Job	9	2	“ I ’ m sure that what you have said is true . But how can human beings prove to God they are not guilty ?
NIRV	Job	9	3	They might wish to argue with him . But they couldn ’ t answer him even once in a thousand times .
NIRV	Job	9	4	His wisdom is deep . His power is great . No one opposes him and comes away unharmed .
NIRV	Job	9	5	He moves mountains , and they don ’ t even know it . When he is angry , he turns them upside down .
NIRV	Job	9	6	He shakes the earth loose from its place . He makes its pillars tremble .
NIRV	Job	9	7	When he tells the sun not to shine , it doesn ’ t . He turns off the light of the stars .
NIRV	Job	9	8	He ’ s the only one who can spread out the heavens . He alone can walk on the waves of the ocean .
NIRV	Job	9	10	He does wonderful things that can ’ t be understood . He does miracles that can ’ t even be counted .
NIRV	Job	9	11	When he passes by me , I can ’ t see him . When he goes past me , I can ’ t recognize him .
NIRV	Job	9	12	If he takes something , who can stop him ? Who would dare to ask him , ‘ What are you doing ? ’
NIRV	Job	9	13	God doesn ’ t hold back his anger . Even the helpers of the sea monster Rahab bowed in fear at his feet .
NIRV	Job	9	14	“ So how can I disagree with God ? How can I possibly argue with him ?
NIRV	Job	9	15	Even if I hadn ’ t done anything wrong , I couldn ’ t answer him . I could only beg my Judge to have mercy on me .
NIRV	Job	9	16	Suppose I called out to him and he answered . I don ’ t believe he ’ d listen to me .
NIRV	Job	9	17	He would send a storm to crush me . He ’ d increase my wounds without any reason .
NIRV	Job	9	18	He wouldn ’ t let me catch my breath . He ’ d make my life very bitter .
NIRV	Job	9	19	If it ’ s a matter of strength , he is mighty ! And if it ’ s a matter of being fair , who would dare to bring charges against him ?
NIRV	Job	9	20	Even if I hadn ’ t sinned , what I said would prove me guilty . Even if I were honest , my words would show that I ’ m wrong .
NIRV	Job	9	21	“ Even though I ’ m honest , I ’ m not concerned about myself . I hate my own life .
NIRV	Job	9	22	It all amounts to the same thing . That ’ s why I say , ‘ God destroys honest people and sinful people alike. ’
NIRV	Job	9	23	Suppose a plague brings sudden death . Then he laughs when those who haven ’ t sinned lose hope .
NIRV	Job	9	24	Suppose a nation falls into the power of sinful people . Then God makes its judges blind to the truth . If he isn ’ t the one doing it , who is ?
NIRV	Job	9	25	“ God , my days race by like a runner . They fly away without seeing any joy .
NIRV	Job	9	26	They speed along like papyrus boats . They are like eagles swooping down on their food .
NIRV	Job	9	27	Suppose I say , ‘ I ’ ll forget about all my problems . I ’ ll change my frown into a smile. ’
NIRV	Job	9	28	Then I ’ d still be afraid I ’ d go on suffering . That ’ s because I know you would say I had done something wrong .
NIRV	Job	9	29	In fact , you have already said I ’ m guilty . So why should I struggle without any reason ?
NIRV	Job	9	30	Suppose I clean myself with soap . Suppose I wash my hands with cleanser .
NIRV	Job	9	31	Even then you would throw me into a muddy pit . And even my clothes would hate me .
NIRV	Job	9	32	“ God isn ’ t a mere human being like me . I can ’ t answer him . We can ’ t take each other to court .
NIRV	Job	9	33	I wish someone would settle matters between us . I wish someone would bring us together .
NIRV	Job	9	34	I wish someone would keep God from punishing me . Then his terror wouldn ’ t frighten me anymore .
NIRV	Job	9	35	I would speak up without being afraid of him . But as things stand now , I can ’ t do that . Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	10	10	Didn ’ t you pour me out like milk ? Didn ’ t you form me like cheese ?
NIRV	Job	10	2	I say to God , ‘ Don ’ t find me guilty . Instead , tell me what charges you are bringing against me .
NIRV	Job	10	3	Does it make you happy when you crush me ? Does it please you to turn your back on what you have made ? While you do those things , you smile on the plans of sinful people !
NIRV	Job	10	4	You don ’ t have human eyes . You don ’ t see as people see .
NIRV	Job	10	5	Your days aren ’ t like the days of a mere human being . Your years aren ’ t even like the years of a strong man .
NIRV	Job	10	6	So you search for my mistakes . You look for my sin .
NIRV	Job	10	7	You already know I ’ m not guilty . No one can save me from your power .
NIRV	Job	10	8	“ ‘ Your hands shaped me and made me . So are you going to destroy me now ?
NIRV	Job	10	9	Remember , you molded me like clay . So are you going to turn me back into dust ?
NIRV	Job	10	11	Didn ’ t you put skin and flesh on me ? Didn ’ t you sew me together with bones and muscles ?
NIRV	Job	10	12	You gave me life . You were kind to me . You took good care of me . You watched over me .
NIRV	Job	10	13	“ ‘ But here ’ s what you hid in your heart . Here ’ s what you had on your mind .
NIRV	Job	10	14	If I sinned , you would be watching me . You wouldn ’ t let me go without punishing me .
NIRV	Job	10	15	If I were guilty , how terrible that would be for me ! Even if I haven ’ t sinned , I can ’ t be proud of what I ’ ve done . That ’ s because I ’ m so full of shame . I ’ m drowning in my suffering .
NIRV	Job	10	16	If I become proud , you hunt me down like a lion . You show your mighty power against me .
NIRV	Job	10	17	You bring new witnesses against me . You become more and more angry with me . You use your power against me again and again .
NIRV	Job	10	18	“ ‘ Why did you bring me out of my mother ’ s body ? I wish I had died before anyone saw me .
NIRV	Job	10	19	I wish I ’ d never been born ! I wish I ’ d been carried straight from my mother ’ s body to the grave !
NIRV	Job	10	20	Aren ’ t my few days almost over ? Leave me so I can have a moment of joy .
NIRV	Job	10	21	Turn away before I go to the place I can ’ t return from . It ’ s the land of gloom and total darkness .
NIRV	Job	10	22	It ’ s the land of darkest night and total darkness and disorder . There even the light is like darkness. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	11	11	He certainly knows when people tell lies . When he sees evil , he pays careful attention to it .
NIRV	Job	11	2	“ Don ’ t all your words require an answer ? I ’ m sure that what you are saying can ’ t be right .
NIRV	Job	11	3	Your useless talk won ’ t keep us quiet . Someone has to correct you when you make fun of truth .
NIRV	Job	11	4	You say to God , ‘ My beliefs are perfect . I ’ m pure in your sight. ’
NIRV	Job	11	5	I wish God would speak . I wish he ’ d answer you .
NIRV	Job	11	6	I wish he ’ d show you the secrets of wisdom . After all , true wisdom has two sides . Here ’ s what I want you to know . God has forgotten some of your sins .
NIRV	Job	11	7	“ Do you know how deep the mysteries of God are ? Can you discover the limits of the Mighty One ’ s knowledge ?
NIRV	Job	11	8	They are higher than the heavens above . What can you do ? They are deeper than the deepest parts of the earth below . What can you know ?
NIRV	Job	11	9	They are longer than the earth . They are wider than the ocean .
NIRV	Job	11	10	“ Suppose God comes along and puts you in prison . Suppose he takes you to court . Then who can oppose him ?
NIRV	Job	11	12	A wild donkey ’ s colt can ’ t be born a human being . And it ’ s just as impossible that a person without sense can become wise .
NIRV	Job	11	13	“ So commit yourself to God completely . Reach out your hands to him for help .
NIRV	Job	11	14	Get rid of all the sin you have . Don ’ t let anything that is evil stay in your tent .
NIRV	Job	11	15	Then , free of those things , you can face others . You can stand firm without being afraid .
NIRV	Job	11	16	You can be sure you will forget your troubles . They will be like water that has flowed on by .
NIRV	Job	11	17	Life will be brighter than the sun at noon . And darkness will become like morning .
NIRV	Job	11	18	You will be secure , because there is hope . You will look around you and find a safe place to rest .
NIRV	Job	11	19	You will lie down , and no one will make you afraid . Many people will want you to help them .
NIRV	Job	11	20	But sinful people won ’ t find what they are looking for . They won ’ t be able to escape . All they can hope for is to die. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	12	2	“ You people think you are the only ones who matter ! You are sure that wisdom will die with you !
NIRV	Job	12	3	But I have a brain , just like you . I ’ m as clever as you are . In fact , everyone knows as much as you do .
NIRV	Job	12	4	“ My friends laugh at me all the time , even though I called out to God and he answered . My friends laugh at me , even though I ’ m honest and right .
NIRV	Job	12	5	People who have an easy life look down on those who have problems . They think trouble comes only to those whose feet are slipping .
NIRV	Job	12	6	Why doesn ’ t anyone bother the tents of robbers ? Why do those who make God angry remain secure ? They are in God ’ s hands !
NIRV	Job	12	7	“ But ask the animals what God does . They will teach you . Or ask the birds in the sky . They will tell you .
NIRV	Job	12	8	Or speak to the earth . It will teach you . Or let the fish in the ocean educate you .
NIRV	Job	12	9	Are there any of these creatures that don ’ t know what the powerful hand of the Lord has done ?
NIRV	Job	12	10	He holds the life of every creature in his hand . He controls the breath of every human being .
NIRV	Job	12	11	Our tongues tell us what tastes good and what doesn ’ t . And our ears tell us what ’ s true and what isn ’ t .
NIRV	Job	12	13	“ Wisdom and power belong to God . Advice and understanding also belong to him .
NIRV	Job	12	14	What he tears down can ’ t be rebuilt . The people he puts in prison can ’ t be set free .

NIRV	Job	12	17	He removes the wisdom of rulers and leads them away . He makes judges look foolish .
NIRV	Job	12	18	He sets people free from the chains that kings put on them . Then he dresses the kings in the clothes of slaves .

NIRV	Job	12	21	He looks down on proud leaders . He takes away the strength of those who are mighty .
NIRV	Job	12	22	He tells people the secrets of darkness . He brings total darkness out into the light .

NIRV	Job	12	24	He takes away the understanding of the leaders of the earth . He makes them wander in a desert where no one lives .

NIRV	Job	14	2	They grow like flowers , and then they dry up . They are like shadows that quickly disappear .
NIRV	Job	14	3	“ God , do you even notice them ? Will you let them appear in your court ?
NIRV	Job	14	4	Who can bring what is pure from something that isn ’ t pure ? No one !
NIRV	Job	14	5	You decide how long anyone will live . You have established the number of his months . You have set a limit to the number of his days .
NIRV	Job	14	6	So look away from him . Leave him alone . Let him put in his time like a hired worker .
NIRV	Job	14	7	“ At least there is hope for a tree . If it ’ s cut down , it will begin to grow again . New branches will appear on it .
NIRV	Job	14	8	Its roots may grow old in the ground . Its stump may die in the soil .
NIRV	Job	14	9	But when it smells water , it will begin to grow . It will send out new growth like a plant .
NIRV	Job	14	10	No man is like that . When he dies , he is buried in a grave . He takes his last breath . Then he is gone .
NIRV	Job	14	11	Water dries up from lakes . Riverbeds become empty and dry .
NIRV	Job	14	12	In the same way , people lie down and never get up . People won ’ t wake or rise from their sleep until the heavens are gone .
NIRV	Job	14	13	“ I wish you would hide me in a grave ! I wish you would cover me up until your anger passes by ! I wish you would set the time for me to spend in the grave and then bring me back up !
NIRV	Job	14	15	You will call out to me , and I will answer you . You will long for the person your hands have made .
NIRV	Job	14	16	Then you will count every step I take . But you won ’ t keep track of my sin .
NIRV	Job	14	17	The wrong things I ’ ve done will be sealed up in a bag . You will wipe out my sins by forgiving them .

NIRV	Job	15	15	God doesn ’ t trust his holy angels . Even the heavens aren ’ t pure in his sight .
NIRV	Job	15	2	“ Job , would a wise person answer with a lot of meaningless talk ? Would they fill their stomach with the hot east wind ?
NIRV	Job	15	3	Would they argue with useless words ? Would they give worthless speeches ?
NIRV	Job	15	4	But you even cause others to lose their respect for God . You make it hard for them to be faithful to him .
NIRV	Job	15	5	Your sin makes you say evil things . You talk like people who twist the truth .

NIRV	Job	15	11	Aren ’ t God ’ s words of comfort enough for you ? He speaks them to you gently .
NIRV	Job	15	12	Why have you let your wild ideas carry you away ? Why do your eyes flash with anger ?
NIRV	Job	15	13	Why do you get so angry with God ? Why do words like those pour out of your mouth ?
NIRV	Job	15	14	“ Can human beings really be pure ? Can those who are born really be right with God ?
NIRV	Job	15	16	So he ’ ll certainly find fault with human beings . After all , they are evil and sinful . They drink up evil as if it were water .

NIRV	Job	15	19	The land was given only to those people . Their wisdom didn ’ t come from outsiders . And here ’ s what those who are wise have said .
NIRV	Job	15	20	Sinful people always suffer pain . Mean people suffer all their lives .
NIRV	Job	15	21	Terrifying sounds fill their ears . When everything seems to be going well , robbers attack them .
NIRV	Job	15	22	They lose all hope of escaping the darkness of death . They will certainly be killed by swords .
NIRV	Job	15	23	Like vultures , they look around for food . They know that the day they will die is near .
NIRV	Job	15	24	Suffering and pain terrify them . Their troubles overpower them , like a king ready to attack his enemies .
NIRV	Job	15	25	They shake their fists at God . They brag about themselves and oppose the Mighty One .
NIRV	Job	15	26	They boldly charge against him with their thick , strong shields .
NIRV	Job	15	27	“ Their faces are very fat . Their stomachs hang out .
NIRV	Job	15	28	They ’ ll live in towns that have been destroyed . They ’ ll live in houses where no one else lives . The houses will crumble to pieces .
NIRV	Job	15	29	They won ’ t be rich anymore . Their wealth won ’ t last . Their property will no longer spread out over the land .
NIRV	Job	15	30	They won ’ t escape the darkness of death . A flame will dry up everything they have . The breath of God will blow them away .
NIRV	Job	15	31	Don ’ t let them fool themselves by trusting in what is worthless . They won ’ t get anything out of it .
NIRV	Job	15	32	Even before they die , they will dry up . No matter what they do , it won ’ t succeed .
NIRV	Job	15	33	They ’ ll be like vines that are stripped of their unripe grapes . They ’ ll be like olive trees that drop their flowers .
NIRV	Job	15	34	People who are ungodly won ’ t have any children . Fire will burn up the tents of people who accept money from those who want special favors .
NIRV	Job	15	35	Instead of having children , ungodly people create suffering . All they produce is evil . They are full of lies. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	16	14	He smashes through me as if I were a wall . He rushes at me like a fighting man .

NIRV	Job	17	17	My strength is almost gone . I won ’ t live much longer . A grave is waiting for me .
NIRV	Job	17	2	People who make fun of me are all around me . I ’ m forced to watch as they attack me with their words .
NIRV	Job	17	3	“ God , please pay the price to have me set free . Who else would put up money for me ?
NIRV	Job	17	4	You have closed the minds of those who are trying to comfort me . They don ’ t understand that I haven ’ t done anything wrong . So don ’ t let them win the argument .
NIRV	Job	17	5	Suppose someone tells lies about their friends to get a reward . Then their own children will suffer for it .
NIRV	Job	17	6	“ God has made an example of me . People spit in my face .
NIRV	Job	17	7	My eyes have grown weak because I ’ m so sad . My body is so thin it hardly casts a shadow .
NIRV	Job	17	8	People who claim to be honest are shocked when they see me . Those who think they haven ’ t sinned are stirred up against me . They think I ’ m ungodly .
NIRV	Job	17	9	But godly people will keep doing what is right . Those who have clean hands will grow stronger .
NIRV	Job	17	10	“ Come on , all of you ! Try again ! I can ’ t find a wise person among you .
NIRV	Job	17	11	My life is almost over . My plans are destroyed . Yet the desires of my heart
NIRV	Job	17	12	turn night into day . Even though it ’ s dark , ‘ Light is nearby. ’
NIRV	Job	17	13	Suppose the only home I can hope for is a grave . And suppose I make my bed in the darkness of death .
NIRV	Job	17	14	Suppose I say to the grave , ‘ You are like a father to me. ’ And suppose I say to its worms , ‘ You are like a mother or sister to me. ’
NIRV	Job	17	15	Then what hope do I have ? Who can give me any hope ?
NIRV	Job	17	16	Will hope go down to the gates of death with me ? Will we go down together into the dust of the grave ? ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	18	18	They are driven from light into the place of darkness . They are thrown out of the world .
NIRV	Job	18	2	“ Job , when will you stop these speeches of yours ? Be reasonable ! Then we can talk .
NIRV	Job	18	3	Why do you look at us as if we were cattle ? Why do you think of us as being stupid ?
NIRV	Job	18	4	Your anger is tearing you to pieces . Does the earth have to be deserted just to prove you are right ? Must all the rocks be moved from their places ?
NIRV	Job	18	5	“ The lamps of sinful people are blown out . Their flames will never burn again .
NIRV	Job	18	6	The lights in their tents become dark . The lamps beside those who are evil go out .
NIRV	Job	18	7	They walk more slowly than they used to . Their own evil plans make them fall .
NIRV	Job	18	8	Their feet take them into a net . They wander right into it .
NIRV	Job	18	9	A trap grabs hold of their heels . It refuses to let them go .
NIRV	Job	18	10	A trap lies in their path . A rope to catch them is hidden on the ground .
NIRV	Job	18	11	Terrors alarm them on every side . They follow them every step of the way .
NIRV	Job	18	12	Trouble would like to eat them up . Danger waits for them when they fall .
NIRV	Job	18	13	It eats away parts of their skin . Death itself feeds on their arms and legs .
NIRV	Job	18	14	They are torn away from the safety of their tents . They are marched off to the one who rules over death .
NIRV	Job	18	15	Fire races through their tents . Burning sulfur is scattered over their homes .
NIRV	Job	18	16	Their roots dry up under them . Their branches dry up above them .
NIRV	Job	18	17	No one on earth remembers them . Their names are forgotten in the land .
NIRV	Job	18	19	Their family dies out among their people . No one is left where they used to live .
NIRV	Job	18	20	What has happened to them shocks the people in the west . It terrifies the people in the east .
NIRV	Job	18	21	Now you know what the homes of sinners are like . Those who don ’ t know God live in places like that. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	19	19	All my close friends hate me . Those I love have turned against me .
NIRV	Job	19	2	“ How long will you people make me suffer ? How long will you crush me with your words ?
NIRV	Job	19	3	You have already accused me many times . You have attacked me without feeling any shame .
NIRV	Job	19	4	Suppose it ’ s true that I ’ ve gone down the wrong path . Then it ’ s my concern , not yours .
NIRV	Job	19	5	Suppose you want to place yourselves above me . Suppose you want to use my shame to prove I ’ m wrong .
NIRV	Job	19	6	Then I want you to know that God hasn ’ t treated me right . In fact , he has captured me in his net .
NIRV	Job	19	7	“ I cry out , ‘ Someone harmed me ! ’ But I don ’ t get any reply . I call out for help . But I ’ m not treated fairly .
NIRV	Job	19	8	God has blocked my way , and I can ’ t get through . He has made my paths so dark I can ’ t see where I ’ m going .
NIRV	Job	19	9	He has taken my wealth away from me . He has stripped me of my honor .
NIRV	Job	19	10	He tears me down on every side until I ’ m gone . He pulls up the roots of my hope as if I were a tree .
NIRV	Job	19	11	His anger burns against me . He thinks I ’ m one of his enemies .
NIRV	Job	19	12	His troops march toward me in force . They come at me from every direction . They camp around my tent .
NIRV	Job	19	13	“ God has caused my family to desert me . The people I used to know are now strangers to me .
NIRV	Job	19	14	My relatives have gone away . My closest friends have forgotten me .
NIRV	Job	19	15	My guests and my female servants think of me as a stranger . They look at me as if I were an outsider .
NIRV	Job	19	16	I send for my servant , but he doesn ’ t answer . He doesn ’ t come , even though I beg him to .
NIRV	Job	19	17	My wife can ’ t stand the way my breath smells . My own family won ’ t have anything to do with me .
NIRV	Job	19	18	Even little children mock me . When I appear , they make fun of me .
NIRV	Job	19	20	I ’ m nothing but skin and bones . I ’ ve barely escaped death .
NIRV	Job	19	21	“ Have pity on me , my friends ! Please have pity ! God has struck me down with his powerful hand .
NIRV	Job	19	22	Why do you chase after me as he does ? Aren ’ t you satisfied with what you have done to me already ?
NIRV	Job	19	23	“ I wish my words were written down ! I wish they were written in a book !
NIRV	Job	19	24	I wish they were cut into lead with an iron tool ! I wish they were carved in rock forever !
NIRV	Job	19	25	I know that my redeemer lives . In the end he will stand on the earth .
NIRV	Job	19	26	Though my skin will be destroyed , in my body I ’ ll see God .
NIRV	Job	19	27	I myself will see him with my own eyes . I ’ ll see him , and he won ’ t be a stranger to me . How my heart longs for that day !
NIRV	Job	19	28	“ You might say , ‘ Let ’ s keep bothering Job . After all , he ’ s the cause of all his suffering. ’
NIRV	Job	19	29	But you should be afraid when God comes to judge you . He ’ ll be angry . He ’ ll punish you with his sword . Then you will know that he is the Judge. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	20	2	“ My troubled thoughts force me to answer you . That ’ s because I ’ m very upset .
NIRV	Job	20	3	What you have just said dishonors me . So I really have to reply to you .
NIRV	Job	20	4	“ I ’ m sure you must know how things have always been . They ’ ve been that way ever since human beings were placed on this earth .
NIRV	Job	20	5	Those who are evil are happy for only a short time . The joy of ungodly people lasts only for a moment .
NIRV	Job	20	6	Their pride might reach all the way up to the heavens . Their heads might touch the clouds .
NIRV	Job	20	7	But they will disappear forever , like the waste from their own bodies . Anyone who has seen them will say , ‘ Where did they go ? ’
NIRV	Job	20	8	Like a dream they will fly away . They will never be seen again . They will be driven away like visions in the night .
NIRV	Job	20	9	The eyes that saw them won ’ t see them anymore . Even their own families won ’ t remember them .
NIRV	Job	20	10	Their children must pay back what they took from poor people . Their own hands must give back the wealth they stole .
NIRV	Job	20	11	They might feel young and very strong . But they will soon lie down in the dust of their graves .
NIRV	Job	20	12	“ Anything that is evil tastes sweet to them . They keep it under their tongues for a while .
NIRV	Job	20	13	They can ’ t stand to let it go . So they hold it in their mouths .
NIRV	Job	20	14	But their food will turn sour in their stomachs . It will become like the poison of a serpent inside them .
NIRV	Job	20	15	They will spit out the rich food they swallowed . God will make their stomachs throw it up .
NIRV	Job	20	16	They will suck the poison of a serpent . The fangs of an adder will kill them .
NIRV	Job	20	17	They won ’ t enjoy streams that flow with honey . They won ’ t enjoy rivers that flow with cream .
NIRV	Job	20	18	What they worked for they must give back before they can eat it . They won ’ t enjoy what they have earned .
NIRV	Job	20	19	They ’ ve crushed poor people and left them with nothing . They ’ ve taken over houses they didn ’ t even build .
NIRV	Job	20	21	There isn ’ t anything left for them to eat up . Their success won ’ t last .
NIRV	Job	20	22	While they are enjoying the good life , trouble will catch up with them . Terrible suffering will come on them .
NIRV	Job	20	23	When they ’ ve filled their stomachs , God will pour out his great anger on them . He ’ ll strike them down with blow after blow .
NIRV	Job	20	24	They might run away from iron weapons . But arrows that have bronze tips will wound them .
NIRV	Job	20	25	They will pull the arrows out of their backs . They will remove the shining tips from their livers . They will be filled with terror .
NIRV	Job	20	26	Total darkness hides and waits for their treasures . God will send a fire that will destroy them . It will burn up everything that ’ s left in their tents .
NIRV	Job	20	27	Heaven will show their guilt to everyone . The earth will be a witness against them .
NIRV	Job	20	28	A flood will carry their houses away . Rushing water will wash them away on the day when God judges .

NIRV	Job	21	21	What do they care about the families they leave behind ? What do they care about them when their lives come to an end ?
NIRV	Job	21	2	“ Listen carefully to what I ’ m saying . Let that be the comfort you people give me .
NIRV	Job	21	3	Put up with me while I speak . After I ’ ve spoken , you can make fun of me !
NIRV	Job	21	4	“ I ’ m not arguing with mere human beings . So why shouldn ’ t I be angry and uneasy ?
NIRV	Job	21	5	Look at me and be shocked . Put your hand over your mouth and stop talking !
NIRV	Job	21	6	When I think about these things , I ’ m terrified . My whole body trembles .
NIRV	Job	21	7	Why do sinful people keep on living ? The older they grow , the richer they get .
NIRV	Job	21	8	They see their children grow up around them . They watch their family grow larger .
NIRV	Job	21	9	Their homes are safe . They don ’ t have to be afraid . God isn ’ t punishing them .
NIRV	Job	21	10	Every time their bulls mate , their cows become pregnant . And the calves don ’ t die before they are born .
NIRV	Job	21	11	Sinful people send their children out like a flock of lambs . Their little ones dance around .
NIRV	Job	21	12	They sing to the music of tambourines and lyres . They have a good time while flutes are being played .
NIRV	Job	21	13	Those who are evil spend their years living well . They go down to their graves in peace .
NIRV	Job	21	14	But they say to God , ‘ Leave us alone ! We don ’ t want to know how you want us to live .
NIRV	Job	21	15	Who is the Mighty One ? Why should we serve him ? What would we get if we prayed to him ? ’
NIRV	Job	21	16	But they aren ’ t in control of their own success . So I don ’ t pay any attention to their plans .
NIRV	Job	21	17	“ How often are their lamps blown out ? How often does trouble come on them ? How often does God punish them when he ’ s angry ?
NIRV	Job	21	18	How often are they like straw blowing in the wind ? How often are they like tumbleweeds swept away by a storm ?
NIRV	Job	21	19	People say , ‘ God stores up the punishment of evil people for their children. ’ But let God punish the evil people themselves . Then they ’ ll learn a lesson from it .
NIRV	Job	21	20	Let their own eyes see how they are destroyed . Let them drink the wine of the Mighty One ’ s anger .
NIRV	Job	21	22	“ Can anyone teach God anything ? After all , he judges even the angels in heaven .
NIRV	Job	21	23	Some people die while they are still very strong . They are completely secure . They have an easy life .
NIRV	Job	21	24	They are well fed . Their bodies are healthy .
NIRV	Job	21	25	Others die while their spirits are bitter . They ’ ve never enjoyed anything good .
NIRV	Job	21	26	Side by side they lie in the dust of death . The worms in their graves cover all of them .
NIRV	Job	21	27	“ I know exactly what you people are thinking . I know you are planning to do bad things to me .
NIRV	Job	21	28	You are saying to yourselves , ‘ Where is the great man ’ s house now ? Where are the tents where his evil family lived ? ’
NIRV	Job	21	29	Haven ’ t you ever asked questions of those who travel ? Haven ’ t you paid any attention to their stories ?
NIRV	Job	21	30	They ’ ll tell you that sinful people are spared from the day of trouble . They ’ ll say that those people are saved from the day when God will judge .
NIRV	Job	21	31	Who speaks against them for the way they act ? Who pays them back for what they ’ ve done ?
NIRV	Job	21	32	Their bodies will be carried to their graves . Guards will watch over their tombs .
NIRV	Job	21	33	The soil in the valley will be pleasant to those who have died . Many people will walk along behind their bodies . Many others will walk in front of them .

NIRV	Job	22	5	Haven ’ t you done many evil things ? Don ’ t you sin again and again ?
NIRV	Job	22	6	You took clothes away from your relatives just because they owed you some money . You left them naked for no reason at all .
NIRV	Job	22	7	You didn ’ t give any water to people who were tired . You held food back from those who were hungry .
NIRV	Job	22	8	You did it even though you were honored and powerful . You owned land and lived on it .
NIRV	Job	22	9	But you sent widows away without anything . You mistreated children whose fathers had died .

NIRV	Job	22	14	He goes around in the highest heavens . Thick clouds keep him from seeing us. ’
NIRV	Job	22	15	Will you stay on the old path that sinful people have walked on ?
NIRV	Job	22	16	They were carried off even before they died . Their foundations were washed away by a flood .
NIRV	Job	22	17	They said to God , ‘ Leave us alone ! What can you do to us , you Mighty One ? ’
NIRV	Job	22	18	But he was the one who filled their houses with good things . So I don ’ t pay any attention to the plans of evil people .

NIRV	Job	22	23	If you return to the Mighty One , you will have what you had before . But first you must remove everything that is evil far from your tent .
NIRV	Job	22	24	You must throw your gold nuggets away . You must toss your gold from Ophir into a valley .
NIRV	Job	22	25	Then the Mighty One himself will be your gold . He ’ ll be like the finest silver to you .
NIRV	Job	22	26	You will find delight in the Mighty One . You will honor God and trust in him .

NIRV	Job	23	4	I would state my case to him . I ’ d give him all my arguments .

NIRV	Job	23	14	He carries out his plans against me . And he still has many other plans just like them .
NIRV	Job	23	15	That ’ s why I ’ m so terrified . When I think about all of this , I ’ m afraid of him .
NIRV	Job	23	16	God has made my heart weak . The Mighty One has filled me with terror .

NIRV	Job	24	24	For a little while they are honored . Then they are gone . They are brought low . And they die like everyone else . They are cut off like heads of grain .
NIRV	Job	24	2	People move their neighbor ’ s boundary stones . They steal their neighbor ’ s flocks .
NIRV	Job	24	3	They take away the donkeys that belong to children whose fathers have died . They take a widow ’ s ox until she has paid what she owes .
NIRV	Job	24	4	They push those who are needy out of their way . They force all the poor people in the land to go into hiding .
NIRV	Job	24	5	The poor are like wild donkeys in the desert . They have to go around looking for food . The dry and empty land provides the only food for their children .
NIRV	Job	24	6	The poor go to the fields and get a little grain . They gather up what is left in the vineyards of sinners .
NIRV	Job	24	7	The poor don ’ t have any clothes . So they spend the night naked . They don ’ t have anything to cover themselves in the cold .
NIRV	Job	24	8	They are soaked by mountain rains . They hug the rocks because they don ’ t have anything to keep them warm .
NIRV	Job	24	9	Children whose fathers have died are torn away from their mothers . A poor person ’ s baby is taken away to pay back what is owed .
NIRV	Job	24	10	The poor don ’ t have any clothes . They go around naked . They carry bundles of grain , but they still go hungry .
NIRV	Job	24	11	They work very hard as they crush olives . They stomp on grapes in winepresses , but they are still thirsty .
NIRV	Job	24	12	The groans of those who are dying are heard from the city . Those who are wounded cry out for help . But God doesn ’ t charge anyone with doing what is wrong .
NIRV	Job	24	13	“ Some people hate it when daylight comes . In the daytime they never walk outside .
NIRV	Job	24	14	When daylight is gone , murderers get up . They kill poor people and those who are in need . In the night they sneak around like robbers .
NIRV	Job	24	15	Those who commit adultery wait until the sun goes down . They think , ‘ No one will see us. ’ They keep their faces hidden .
NIRV	Job	24	16	In the dark , thieves break into houses . But by day they shut themselves in . They don ’ t want anything to do with the light .
NIRV	Job	24	17	Midnight is like morning to them . The terrors of darkness are their friends .
NIRV	Job	24	18	“ But sinners are like bubbles on the surface of water . Their share of the land is under God ’ s curse . So no one goes to their vineyards .
NIRV	Job	24	19	Melted snow disappears when the air is hot and dry . And sinners disappear when they go down into their graves .
NIRV	Job	24	20	Even their mothers forget them . The worms in their graves eat them up . No one remembers sinful people anymore . They are cut down like trees .
NIRV	Job	24	21	They mistreat women who aren ’ t able to have children . They aren ’ t kind to widows .
NIRV	Job	24	22	But God is powerful . He even drags away people who are strong . When he rises up against them , they can never be sure they are safe .
NIRV	Job	24	23	God might let them rest and feel secure . But his eyes see how they live .

NIRV	Job	26	3	You haven ’ t offered advice to those who aren ’ t wise ! In fact , you haven ’ t understood anything at all !
NIRV	Job	26	4	Who helped you say these things ? Whose spirit was speaking through you ?
NIRV	Job	26	5	“ The spirits of the dead are suffering greatly . So are those that are under the waters . And so are all those that live in them .
NIRV	Job	26	6	The place of the dead is naked in the sight of God . The grave lies open in front of him .
NIRV	Job	26	7	He spreads out the northern skies over empty space . He hangs the earth over nothing .
NIRV	Job	26	8	He wraps up water in his clouds . They are heavy , but they don ’ t burst .
NIRV	Job	26	9	He covers the face of the full moon . He spreads his clouds over it .
NIRV	Job	26	10	He marks out the place where the sky meets the sea . He marks out the boundary between light and darkness .
NIRV	Job	26	11	The pillars of the heavens shake . They are terrified when his anger blazes out .
NIRV	Job	26	12	With his power he stirred up the oceans . In his wisdom he cut the sea monster Rahab to pieces .
NIRV	Job	26	13	His breath made the skies bright and clear . His hand wounded the serpent that glides through the sea .
NIRV	Job	26	14	Those are only on the edges of what he does . They are only the soft whispers that we hear from him . So who can understand how very powerful he is ? ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	27	27	Job continued to speak . He said ,
NIRV	Job	27	2	“ God hasn ’ t treated me fairly . The Mighty One has made my life bitter . You can be sure that God lives . And here ’ s something else you can be sure of .
NIRV	Job	27	3	As long as I have life and God gives me breath ,
NIRV	Job	27	4	my mouth won ’ t say evil things . My lips won ’ t tell lies .
NIRV	Job	27	5	I ’ ll never admit you people are right . Until I die , I ’ ll say I ’ m telling the truth .
NIRV	Job	27	6	I ’ ll continue to say I ’ m right . I ’ ll never let go of that . I won ’ t blame myself as long as I live .
NIRV	Job	27	7	“ May my enemies suffer like sinful people ! May my attackers be punished like those who aren ’ t fair !
NIRV	Job	27	8	What hope do ungodly people have when their lives are cut short ? What hope do they have when God takes away their lives ?
NIRV	Job	27	9	God won ’ t listen to their cry when trouble comes on them .
NIRV	Job	27	10	They won ’ t take delight in the Mighty One . They ’ ll never call out to God .
NIRV	Job	27	11	“ I ’ ll teach all of you about God ’ s power . I won ’ t hide the things the Mighty One does .
NIRV	Job	27	12	You have seen those things yourselves . So why do you continue your useless talk ?
NIRV	Job	27	13	“ Here ’ s what God does to sinful people . Here ’ s what those who are mean receive from the Mighty One .
NIRV	Job	27	14	All their children will be killed by swords . They ’ ll never have enough to eat .
NIRV	Job	27	15	A plague will kill those who are left alive . The widows of sinful men won ’ t even weep over their own children .
NIRV	Job	27	16	Sinners might store up silver like dust and clothes like piles of clay .
NIRV	Job	27	17	But people who do what is right will wear those clothes . People who haven ’ t done anything wrong will divide up that silver .
NIRV	Job	27	18	The house an evil person builds is like a moth ’ s cocoon . It ’ s like a hut that ’ s made by someone on guard duty .
NIRV	Job	27	19	Sinful people lie down wealthy , but their wealth is taken away . When they open their eyes , everything is gone .
NIRV	Job	27	20	Terrors sweep over them like a flood . A storm takes them away during the night .
NIRV	Job	27	21	The east wind carries them off , and they are gone . It sweeps them out of their houses .
NIRV	Job	27	22	It blows against them without mercy . They try to escape from its power .
NIRV	Job	27	23	It claps its hands and makes fun of them . It hisses them out of their houses. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	28	2	Iron is taken out of the earth . Copper is melted down from ore.
NIRV	Job	28	3	Human beings light up the darkness . They search for ore in the deepest pits . They look for it in the blackest darkness .
NIRV	Job	28	4	Far from where people live they cut a tunnel . They do it in places where other people don ’ t go . Far away from people they swing back and forth on ropes .
NIRV	Job	28	5	Food grows on the surface of the earth . But far below , the earth is changed as if by fire .
NIRV	Job	28	6	Lapis lazuli is taken from the rocky earth . Its dust contains nuggets of gold .
NIRV	Job	28	7	No bird knows that hidden path . No falcon ’ s eye has seen it .
NIRV	Job	28	8	Proud animals don ’ t walk on it . Lions don ’ t prowl there .
NIRV	Job	28	9	Human hands attack the hardest rock . Their strong hands uncover the base of the mountains .
NIRV	Job	28	10	They tunnel through the rock . Their eyes see all its treasures .
NIRV	Job	28	11	They search the places where the rivers begin . They bring hidden things out into the light .
NIRV	Job	28	12	But where can wisdom be found ? Where does understanding live ?
NIRV	Job	28	13	No human being understands how much it ’ s worth . It can ’ t be found anywhere in the world .
NIRV	Job	28	14	The ocean says , “ It ’ s not in me. ” The sea says , “ It ’ s not here either. ”
NIRV	Job	28	15	It can ’ t be bought with the finest gold . Its price can ’ t be weighed out in silver .
NIRV	Job	28	16	It can ’ t be bought with gold from Ophir . It can ’ t be bought with priceless onyx or lapis lazuli .
NIRV	Job	28	17	Gold or crystal can ’ t compare with it . It can ’ t be bought with jewels made of gold .
NIRV	Job	28	18	Don ’ t bother to talk about coral and jasper . Wisdom is worth far more than rubies .
NIRV	Job	28	19	A topaz from Cush can ’ t compare with it . It can ’ t be bought with the purest gold .
NIRV	Job	28	20	So where does wisdom come from ? Where does understanding live ?
NIRV	Job	28	21	It ’ s hidden from the eyes of every living thing . Even the birds in the sky can ’ t find it .
NIRV	Job	28	22	Death and the Grave say , “ Only reports about it have reached our ears. ”
NIRV	Job	28	23	But God understands the way to it . He is the only one who knows where it lives .
NIRV	Job	28	24	He sees from one end of the earth to the other . He views everything in the world .
NIRV	Job	28	25	He made the mighty wind . He measured out the waters .
NIRV	Job	28	26	He gave orders for the rain to fall . He made paths for the thunderstorms .
NIRV	Job	28	27	Then he looked at wisdom and set its price . He established it and tested it .

NIRV	Job	29	29	Job continued to speak . He said ,
NIRV	Job	29	2	“ How I long for the times when things were better ! That ’ s when God watched over me .
NIRV	Job	29	3	The light of his lamp shone on me . I walked through darkness by his light .
NIRV	Job	29	4	Those were the best days of my life . That ’ s when God ’ s friendship blessed my house .
NIRV	Job	29	5	The Mighty One was still with me . My children were all around me .
NIRV	Job	29	6	The path in front of me was like sweet cream . It was as if the rock poured out olive oil for me .
NIRV	Job	29	7	“ In those days I went to the city gate . I took my seat as a member of the council .
NIRV	Job	29	8	Young people who saw me stepped to one side . Old people stood up as I approached .
NIRV	Job	29	9	The leaders stopped speaking . They covered their mouths with their hands .
NIRV	Job	29	10	The voices of the nobles became quiet . Their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths .
NIRV	Job	29	11	Everyone who heard me said good things about me . Those who saw me honored me .
NIRV	Job	29	12	That ’ s because I saved poor people who cried out for help . I saved helpless children whose fathers had died .
NIRV	Job	29	13	Those who were dying gave me their blessing . I made the hearts of widows sing .
NIRV	Job	29	14	I put on a godly life as if it were my clothes . Fairness was my robe and my turban .
NIRV	Job	29	15	I was like eyes for those who were blind . I was like feet for those who couldn ’ t walk .
NIRV	Job	29	16	I was like a father to needy people . I stood up for strangers in court .
NIRV	Job	29	17	Sinners are like animals that have powerful teeth . But I took from their mouths the people they had caught .
NIRV	Job	29	18	“ I thought , ‘ I ’ ll die in my own house . The days of my life will be as many as the grains of sand .
NIRV	Job	29	19	My roots will reach down to the water . The dew will lie all night on my branches .
NIRV	Job	29	20	I will remain healthy and strong . My bow will stay as good as new in my hand. ’
NIRV	Job	29	21	“ People wanted to hear what I had to say . They waited silently for the advice I gave them .
NIRV	Job	29	22	After I had spoken , they didn ’ t speak anymore . My words fell gently on their ears .
NIRV	Job	29	23	They waited for me just as they would wait for rain showers . They drank my words just as they would drink the spring rain .
NIRV	Job	29	24	When I smiled at them , they could hardly believe it . The light of my face lifted their spirits .
NIRV	Job	29	25	I chose the way they should go . I sat as their chief . I lived as a king lives among his troops . I was like someone who comforts those who are sad . Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	30	30	My skin grows black and peels . My body burns with fever .
NIRV	Job	30	2	Their strong hands couldn ’ t give me any help . That ’ s because their strength was gone .
NIRV	Job	30	3	They were weak because they were needy and hungry . They wandered through dry and empty deserts at night .
NIRV	Job	30	4	Among the bushes they gathered salty plants . They ate the roots of desert bushes .
NIRV	Job	30	5	They were driven away from human society . They were shouted at as if they were robbers .
NIRV	Job	30	6	They were forced to live in dry stream beds . They had to stay among rocks and in holes in the ground .
NIRV	Job	30	7	Like donkeys they cried out among the bushes . There they crowded together and hid .
NIRV	Job	30	8	They were so foolish that no one respected them . They were driven out of the land .
NIRV	Job	30	9	“ Now their children laugh at me . They make fun of me with their songs .
NIRV	Job	30	10	They hate me . They stay away from me . They even dare to spit in my face .
NIRV	Job	30	11	God has made my body weak . It ’ s like a tent that has fallen down . So those children do what they want to in front of me .
NIRV	Job	30	12	Many people attack me on my right side . They lay traps for my feet . They come at me from every direction .
NIRV	Job	30	13	They tear up the road I walk on . They succeed in destroying me . They say , ‘ No one can help him. ’
NIRV	Job	30	14	They attack me like troops smashing through a wall . Among the destroyed buildings they come rolling in .
NIRV	Job	30	15	Terrors sweep over me . My honor is driven away as if by the wind . My safety vanishes like a cloud .
NIRV	Job	30	16	“ Now my life is slipping away . Days of suffering grab hold of me .
NIRV	Job	30	17	At night my bones hurt . My aches and pains never stop .
NIRV	Job	30	18	God ’ s great power becomes like clothes to me . He chokes me like the neck of my shirt .
NIRV	Job	30	19	He throws me down into the mud . I ’ m nothing but dust and ashes .
NIRV	Job	30	20	“ God , I cry out to you . But you don ’ t answer me . I stand up . But all you do is look at me .
NIRV	Job	30	21	You do mean things to me . You attack me with your mighty power .
NIRV	Job	30	22	You pick me up and blow me away with the wind . You toss me around in the storm .
NIRV	Job	30	23	I know that you will bring me down to death . That ’ s what you have appointed for everyone .
NIRV	Job	30	24	“ No one would crush people when they cry out for help in their trouble .
NIRV	Job	30	25	Haven ’ t I wept for those who are in trouble ? Haven ’ t I felt sorry for poor people ?
NIRV	Job	30	26	I hoped good things would happen , but something evil came . I looked for light , but all I saw was darkness .
NIRV	Job	30	27	My insides are always churning . Nothing but days of suffering are ahead of me .
NIRV	Job	30	28	My skin has become dark , but the sun didn ’ t do it . I stand up in the community and cry out for help .
NIRV	Job	30	29	I ’ ve become a brother to wild dogs . Owls are my companions .

NIRV	Job	31	2	What do we receive from God above ? What do we get from the Mighty One in heaven ?
NIRV	Job	31	3	Sinful people are destroyed . Trouble comes to those who do what is wrong .
NIRV	Job	31	4	Doesn ’ t God see how I live ? Doesn ’ t he count every step I take ?
NIRV	Job	31	5	“ I haven ’ t told any lies . My feet haven ’ t hurried to cheat others .
NIRV	Job	31	6	So let God weigh me in honest scales . Then he ’ ll know I haven ’ t done anything wrong .
NIRV	Job	31	7	Suppose my steps have turned away from the right path . Suppose my heart has wanted what my eyes have seen . Or suppose my hands have become ‘ unclean. ’
NIRV	Job	31	8	Then may others eat what I ’ ve planted . May my crops be pulled up by the roots .
NIRV	Job	31	9	“ Suppose my heart has been tempted by a woman . Or suppose I ’ ve prowled around my neighbor ’ s home .
NIRV	Job	31	10	Then may my wife grind another man ’ s grain . May other men sleep with her .
NIRV	Job	31	11	Wanting another woman would have been an evil thing . It would have been a sin that should be judged .
NIRV	Job	31	12	It ’ s like a fire that burns down to the grave . It would have caused my crops to be pulled up by the roots .
NIRV	Job	31	13	“ Suppose I haven ’ t treated any of my male and female servants fairly when they ’ ve brought charges against me .
NIRV	Job	31	14	Then what will I do when God opposes me ? What answer will I give him when he asks me to explain myself ?
NIRV	Job	31	15	Didn ’ t he who made me make my servants also ? Didn ’ t the same God form us inside our mothers ?
NIRV	Job	31	16	“ I haven ’ t said no to what poor people have wanted . I haven ’ t let widows lose their hope .
NIRV	Job	31	17	I haven ’ t kept my bread to myself . I ’ ve shared it with children whose fathers had died .
NIRV	Job	31	18	From the time I was young , I ’ ve helped those widows . I ’ ve raised those children as a father would .
NIRV	Job	31	19	Suppose I ’ ve seen people dying because they didn ’ t have enough clothes . I ’ ve seen needy people who didn ’ t have enough to keep warm .
NIRV	Job	31	20	And they didn ’ t give me their blessing when I warmed them with wool from my sheep .
NIRV	Job	31	21	Suppose I ’ ve raised my hand against children whose fathers have died . And I did it because I knew I had power in the courts .
NIRV	Job	31	22	Then let my arm fall from my shoulder . Let it be broken off at the joint .
NIRV	Job	31	23	I was afraid God would destroy me . His glory terrifies me . So I ’ d never do things like that .
NIRV	Job	31	24	“ Suppose I ’ ve put my trust in gold . I ’ ve said to pure gold , ‘ You make me feel secure. ’
NIRV	Job	31	25	And I ’ m happy because I ’ m so wealthy . I ’ m glad because my hands have earned so much .
NIRV	Job	31	26	Suppose I ’ ve worshiped the sun in all its glory . I ’ ve bowed down to the moon in all its beauty .
NIRV	Job	31	27	My heart has been secretly tempted . My hand has thrown kisses to the sun and moon .
NIRV	Job	31	28	Then these things would have been sins that should be judged . And I wouldn ’ t have been faithful to God in heaven .
NIRV	Job	31	29	“ I wasn ’ t happy when hard times came to my enemies . I didn ’ t enjoy seeing the trouble they had .
NIRV	Job	31	30	I didn ’ t allow my mouth to sin by asking for bad things to happen to them .
NIRV	Job	31	32	No stranger ever had to spend the night in the street . My door was always open to travelers .
NIRV	Job	31	33	I didn ’ t hide my sin as other people do . I didn ’ t hide my guilt in my heart .
NIRV	Job	31	34	I was never afraid of the crowd . I never worried that my relatives might hate me . I didn ’ t have to keep quiet or stay inside .
NIRV	Job	31	35	“ I wish someone would listen to me ! I ’ m signing my name to everything I ’ ve said . I hope the Mighty One will give me his answer . I hope the one who brings charges against me will write them down .
NIRV	Job	31	36	I ’ ll wear them on my shoulder . I ’ ll put them on my head like a crown .
NIRV	Job	31	37	I ’ ll give that person a report of every step I take . I ’ ll present it to him like I would to a ruler .

NIRV	Job	32	32	So the three men stopped answering Job , because he thought he was right .
NIRV	Job	32	2	But Elihu the Buzite was very angry with Job . That ’ s because Job said he himself was right instead of God . Elihu was the son of Barakel . He was from the family of Ram .
NIRV	Job	32	3	Elihu was also very angry with Job ’ s three friends . They hadn ’ t found any way to prove that Job was wrong . But they still said he was guilty .
NIRV	Job	32	4	Elihu had waited before he spoke to Job . That ’ s because the others were older than he was .
NIRV	Job	32	5	But he saw that the three men didn ’ t have anything more to say . So he was very angry .
NIRV	Job	32	6	Elihu the Buzite , the son of Barakel , said , “ I ’ m young , and you are old . So I was afraid to tell you what I know .
NIRV	Job	32	7	I thought , ‘ Those who are older should speak first . Those who have lived for many years should teach people how to be wise. ’
NIRV	Job	32	8	But the spirit in people gives them understanding . The breath of the Mighty One gives them wisdom .
NIRV	Job	32	9	Older people aren ’ t the only ones who are wise . They aren ’ t the only ones who understand what is right .
NIRV	Job	32	10	“ So I ’ m saying you should listen to me . I ’ ll tell you what I know .
NIRV	Job	32	11	I waited while you men spoke . I listened to your reasoning . While you were searching for words ,
NIRV	Job	32	12	I paid careful attention to you . But not one of you has proved that Job is wrong . None of you has answered his arguments .
NIRV	Job	32	13	Don ’ t claim , ‘ We have enough wisdom to answer Job. ’ Let God , not a mere man , prove that he ’ s wrong .
NIRV	Job	32	14	Job hasn ’ t directed his words against me . I won ’ t answer him with your arguments .
NIRV	Job	32	15	“ Job , these men are afraid . They don ’ t have anything else to say . They ’ ve run out of words .
NIRV	Job	32	16	Do I have to keep on waiting , now that they are silent ? They are just standing there with nothing to say .
NIRV	Job	32	17	I too have something to say . I too will tell what I know .
NIRV	Job	32	18	I ’ m full of words . My spirit inside me forces me to speak .
NIRV	Job	32	19	Inside I ’ m like wine that is bottled up . I ’ m like new wineskins ready to burst .
NIRV	Job	32	20	I must speak so I can feel better . I must open my mouth and reply .
NIRV	Job	32	21	I ’ ll treat everyone the same . I won ’ t praise anyone without meaning it .

NIRV	Job	33	2	I ’ m about to open my mouth . My words are on the tip of my tongue .
NIRV	Job	33	3	What I say comes from an honest heart . My lips speak only what I know is true .
NIRV	Job	33	4	The Spirit of God has made me . The breath of the Mighty One gives me life .
NIRV	Job	33	5	So answer me if you can . Stand up and argue your case in front of me .
NIRV	Job	33	6	To God I ’ m just the same as you . I too am a piece of clay .
NIRV	Job	33	7	You don ’ t have to be afraid of me . My hand won ’ t be too heavy on you .

NIRV	Job	33	9	You said , ‘ I ’ m pure . I have done no wrong . I ’ m clean . I ’ m free from sin .
NIRV	Job	33	10	But God has found fault with me . He thinks I ’ m his enemy .
NIRV	Job	33	11	He puts my feet in chains . He watches every step I take. ’
NIRV	Job	33	12	“ But I ’ m telling you that you aren ’ t right when you talk like that . After all , God is greater than any human being .
NIRV	Job	33	13	Why do you claim that God never answers anybody ’ s questions ?
NIRV	Job	33	14	He speaks in one way and then another . But we do not even realize it .
NIRV	Job	33	15	He might speak in a dream or in a vision at night . That ’ s when people are sound asleep in their beds .
NIRV	Job	33	16	He might speak in their ears . His warnings might terrify them .
NIRV	Job	33	17	He warns them in order to turn them away from sinning . He wants to keep them from being proud .
NIRV	Job	33	18	He wants to stop them from going down into the grave . He doesn ’ t want them to be killed by swords .
NIRV	Job	33	19	Someone might be punished by suffering in bed . The pain in their bones might never go away .
NIRV	Job	33	20	They might feel so bad they can ’ t eat anything . They might even hate the finest food .
NIRV	Job	33	21	Their body might waste away to nothing . Their bones might have been hidden . But now they stick out .
NIRV	Job	33	22	They might approach the very edge of the grave . The messengers of death might come for them .
NIRV	Job	33	23	But suppose there is an angel who will speak up for him . The angel is very special . He ’ s one out of a thousand . He will tell that person how to do what is right .
NIRV	Job	33	24	That angel will be gracious to them . He ’ ll say to God , ‘ Spare them from going down into the grave . I know a way that can set them free. ’
NIRV	Job	33	25	Then their body is made like new again . They become as strong and healthy as when they were young .
NIRV	Job	33	26	Then that person can pray to God and be blessed by him . They will see God ’ s face and shout for joy . God will make them well and happy again .
NIRV	Job	33	27	Then that person will come to others and say , ‘ I sinned . I made what is wrong appear to be right . But I wasn ’ t punished as I should have been .
NIRV	Job	33	28	God has set me free . He has kept me from going down into the darkness of the grave . So I ’ ll live to enjoy the light of life. ’
NIRV	Job	33	29	“ God does all these things to people . In fact , he does them again and again .
NIRV	Job	33	30	He wants to stop people from going down into the darkness of the grave . Then the light of life will shine on them .
NIRV	Job	33	31	“ Pay attention , Job ! Listen to me ! Be quiet so I can speak .
NIRV	Job	33	32	If you have anything to say , answer me . Speak up . I want to help you be cleared of all charges .

NIRV	Job	34	7	Is there anyone like Job ? He accuses God as easily as he drinks water .
NIRV	Job	34	8	He ’ s a companion of those who do evil . He spends his time with sinful people .
NIRV	Job	34	9	He asks , ‘ What good is it to try to please God ? ’
NIRV	Job	34	10	“ So listen to me , you men who have understanding . God would never do what is evil . The Mighty One would never do what is wrong .
NIRV	Job	34	11	He pays back everyone for what they ’ ve done . He gives them exactly what they should get .
NIRV	Job	34	12	It isn ’ t possible for God to do wrong . The Mighty One would never treat people unfairly .
NIRV	Job	34	13	Who appointed him to rule over the earth ? Who put him in charge of the whole world ?
NIRV	Job	34	14	If he really wanted to , he could hold back his spirit and breath .
NIRV	Job	34	15	Then everyone would die together . They would return to the dust .
NIRV	Job	34	16	“ Job , if you have understanding , listen to me . Pay attention to what I ’ m saying .
NIRV	Job	34	17	Can someone who hates to be fair govern ? Will you bring charges against the holy and mighty God ?
NIRV	Job	34	18	He says to kings , ‘ You are worthless. ’ He says to nobles , ‘ You are evil. ’
NIRV	Job	34	19	He doesn ’ t favor princes . He treats rich people and poor people the same . His hands created all of them .
NIRV	Job	34	20	They die suddenly in the middle of the night . God strikes them down , and they pass away . Even people who are mighty are removed , but not by human hands .
NIRV	Job	34	21	“ His eyes see how people live . He watches every step they take .
NIRV	Job	34	22	There is no deep shadow or total darkness where those who do what is evil can hide .
NIRV	Job	34	23	God doesn ’ t need to bring charges against anyone . He knows they are guilty . So he doesn ’ t need to have them appear in his court to be judged .
NIRV	Job	34	24	He destroys the mighty without asking them questions in court . Then he sets others up in their places .
NIRV	Job	34	25	He knows what they do . So he crushes them during the night .
NIRV	Job	34	26	He punishes them for the sins they commit . He does it where everyone can see them .
NIRV	Job	34	27	That ’ s because they turned away from following him . They didn ’ t have respect for anything he does .
NIRV	Job	34	28	They caused poor people to cry out to him . He heard the cries of those who were in need .
NIRV	Job	34	29	But if he remains silent , who can judge him ? If he turns his face away , who can see him ? He rules over individual people and nations alike .
NIRV	Job	34	30	He keeps those who are ungodly from ruling . He keeps them from laying traps for others .
NIRV	Job	34	31	“ Someone might say to God , ‘ I ’ m guilty of sinning , but I won ’ t do it anymore .
NIRV	Job	34	32	Show me my sins that I ’ m not aware of . If I ’ ve done what is wrong , I won ’ t do it again. ’
NIRV	Job	34	33	But you refuse to turn away from your sins . So God won ’ t treat you the way you want to be treated . You must decide , Job . I can ’ t do it for you . So tell me what you know .
NIRV	Job	34	35	‘ Job doesn ’ t know what he ’ s talking about . The things he has said don ’ t make any sense. ’
NIRV	Job	34	36	I wish Job would be given the hardest test possible ! He answered like someone who is evil .
NIRV	Job	34	37	To his sin he adds even more sin . He claps his hands and makes fun of us . He multiplies his words against God. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	35	35	Elihu continued ,
NIRV	Job	35	2	“ Job , do you think it ’ s fair for you to say , ‘ I am the one who is right , not God ’ ?
NIRV	Job	35	3	You ask him , ‘ What good is it for me not to sin ? What do I get by not sinning ? ’
NIRV	Job	35	4	“ I ’ d like to reply to you and to your friends who are with you .
NIRV	Job	35	5	Look up at the heavens . Observe the clouds that are high above you .
NIRV	Job	35	6	If you sin , what does that mean to God ? If you sin many times , what does that do to him ?
NIRV	Job	35	7	If you do what is right , how does that help him ? What does he get from you ?
NIRV	Job	35	8	The evil things you do only hurt people like yourself . The right things you do only help other human beings .
NIRV	Job	35	9	“ People cry out when they are treated badly . They beg to be set free from the power of those who are over them .
NIRV	Job	35	10	But no one says , ‘ Where is the God who made me ? He gives us songs even during the night .
NIRV	Job	35	11	He teaches us more than he teaches the wild animals . He makes us wiser than the birds in the sky. ’
NIRV	Job	35	12	He doesn ’ t answer sinful people when they cry out to him . That ’ s because they are so proud .
NIRV	Job	35	13	In fact , God doesn ’ t listen to their empty cries . The Mighty One doesn ’ t pay any attention to them .
NIRV	Job	35	14	So he certainly won ’ t listen to you . When you say you don ’ t see him , he won ’ t hear you . He won ’ t listen when you state your case to him . He won ’ t pay attention even if you wait for him .
NIRV	Job	35	15	When you say his anger never punishes sin , he won ’ t hear you . He won ’ t listen when you say he doesn ’ t pay any attention to evil .
NIRV	Job	35	16	So you say things that don ’ t mean anything . You use a lot of words , but you don ’ t know what you are talking about. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	36	36	Elihu continued ,
NIRV	Job	36	2	“ Put up with me a little longer . I ’ ll show you I can speak up for God even more .
NIRV	Job	36	3	I get my knowledge from far away . I ’ ll announce that the God who made me is fair .
NIRV	Job	36	4	You can be sure that my words are true . One who has perfect knowledge is talking to you .
NIRV	Job	36	5	“ God is mighty , but he doesn ’ t hate people . He ’ s mighty , and he knows exactly what he ’ s going to do .
NIRV	Job	36	6	He doesn ’ t keep alive those who are evil . Instead , he gives suffering people their rights .
NIRV	Job	36	7	He watches over those who do what is right . He puts them on thrones as if they were kings . He honors them forever .
NIRV	Job	36	8	But some people are held by chains . Their pain ties them up like ropes .
NIRV	Job	36	9	God tells them what they ’ ve done . He tells them they ’ ve become proud and sinned against him .
NIRV	Job	36	10	He makes them listen when he corrects them . He commands them to turn away from the evil things they ’ ve done .
NIRV	Job	36	11	If they obey him and serve him , they ’ ll enjoy a long and happy life . Things will go well with them .
NIRV	Job	36	12	But if they don ’ t listen to him , they ’ ll be killed by swords . They ’ ll die because they didn ’ t want to know anything about him .
NIRV	Job	36	13	“ Those whose hearts are ungodly are always angry . Even when God puts them in chains , they don ’ t cry out for help .
NIRV	Job	36	14	They die while they are still young . They die among the male prostitutes at the temples .
NIRV	Job	36	15	But God saves suffering people while they suffer . He speaks to them while they are hurting .
NIRV	Job	36	16	“ Job , he wants to take you out of the jaws of trouble . He wants to bring you to a wide and safe place . He ’ d like to seat you at a table that is loaded with the best food .
NIRV	Job	36	17	But now you are loaded down with the punishment sinners will receive . You have been judged fairly .
NIRV	Job	36	18	Be careful that no one tempts you with riches . Don ’ t take money from people who want special favors , no matter how much it is .
NIRV	Job	36	19	Can your wealth keep you out of trouble ? Can all your mighty efforts keep you going ?
NIRV	Job	36	20	Don ’ t wish for the night to come so you can drag people away from their homes .
NIRV	Job	36	21	Be careful not to do what is evil . You seem to like evil better than suffering !
NIRV	Job	36	22	“ God is honored because he is so powerful . There is no teacher equal to him .
NIRV	Job	36	23	Who has told him what he can do ? Who has said to him , ‘ You have done what is wrong ’ ?
NIRV	Job	36	24	Remember to thank him for what he ’ s done . People have praised him with their songs .
NIRV	Job	36	25	Every human being has seen his work . People can see it from far away .
NIRV	Job	36	26	How great God is ! We ’ ll never completely understand him . We ’ ll never find out how long he has lived .
NIRV	Job	36	27	“ He makes mist rise from the water . Then it falls as rain into the streams .
NIRV	Job	36	28	The clouds pour down their moisture . Rain showers fall on people everywhere .
NIRV	Job	36	29	Who can understand how God spreads out the clouds ? Who can explain how he thunders from his home in heaven ?
NIRV	Job	36	30	See how he scatters his lightning around him ! He lights up the deepest parts of the ocean .
NIRV	Job	36	31	The rain he sends makes things grow for the nations . He provides them with plenty of food .
NIRV	Job	36	32	He holds lightning bolts in his hands . He commands them to strike their marks .

NIRV	Job	37	2	Listen ! Listen to the roar of his voice ! Listen to the thunder that comes from him !
NIRV	Job	37	3	He sends his lightning across the sky . It reaches from one end of the earth to the other .
NIRV	Job	37	4	Next comes the sound of his roaring thunder . He thunders with his majestic voice . When his voice fills the air , he doesn ’ t hold anything back .
NIRV	Job	37	5	God ’ s voice thunders in wonderful ways . We ’ ll never understand the great things he does .
NIRV	Job	37	6	He says to the snow , ‘ Fall on the earth. ’ He tells the rain , ‘ Pour down your mighty waters. ’
NIRV	Job	37	7	He stops everyone from working . He wants them to see his work .
NIRV	Job	37	8	The animals go inside . They remain in their dens .
NIRV	Job	37	9	The storm comes out of its storeroom in the heavens . The cold comes from the driving winds .
NIRV	Job	37	10	The breath of God produces ice . The shallow water freezes over .
NIRV	Job	37	11	He loads the clouds with moisture . He scatters his lightning through them .
NIRV	Job	37	12	He directs the clouds to circle above the surface of the whole earth . They do everything he commands them to do .
NIRV	Job	37	13	He tells the clouds to punish people . Or he brings them to water his earth and show his love .
NIRV	Job	37	14	“ Job , listen to me . Stop and think about the wonderful things God does .
NIRV	Job	37	15	Do you know how he controls the clouds ? Do you understand how he makes his lightning flash ?
NIRV	Job	37	16	Do you know how the clouds stay up in the sky ? Do you understand the wonders of the God who has perfect knowledge ?
NIRV	Job	37	17	Even your clothes are too hot for you when the land lies quiet under the south wind .
NIRV	Job	37	18	Can you help God spread out the skies ? They are as hard as a mirror that ’ s made out of bronze .
NIRV	Job	37	19	“ Job , tell us what we should say to God . We can ’ t prepare our case because our minds are dark .
NIRV	Job	37	20	Should he be told that I want to speak ? Would anyone ask to be destroyed by him ?
NIRV	Job	37	21	No one can look at the sun . It ’ s too bright after the wind has swept the skies clean .
NIRV	Job	37	22	Out of the north , God comes in his shining glory . He comes in all his wonderful majesty .
NIRV	Job	37	23	We can ’ t reach up to the Mighty One . He is lifted high because of his power . Everything he does is fair and right . So he doesn ’ t crush people .
NIRV	Job	37	24	That ’ s why they have respect for him . He cares about all those who are wise. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	38	5	Who measured it ? I am sure you know ! Who stretched a measuring line across it ?
NIRV	Job	38	6	What was it built on ? Who laid its most important stone ?
NIRV	Job	38	7	When it happened , the morning stars sang together . All the angels shouted with joy .
NIRV	Job	38	8	“ Who created the ocean ? Who caused it to be born ?
NIRV	Job	38	9	I put clouds over it as if they were its clothes . I wrapped it in thick darkness .
NIRV	Job	38	10	I set limits for it . I put its doors and metal bars in place .
NIRV	Job	38	11	I said , ‘ You can come this far . But you can ’ t come any farther . Here is where your proud waves have to stop. ’
NIRV	Job	38	12	“ Job , have you ever commanded the morning to come ? Have you ever shown the sun where to rise ?
NIRV	Job	38	13	The daylight takes the earth by its edges as if it were a blanket . Then it shakes sinful people out of it .
NIRV	Job	38	14	The earth takes shape like clay stamped with an official ’ s mark . Its features stand out like the different parts of your clothes .

NIRV	Job	38	23	I store up snow and hail for times of trouble . I keep them for days of war and battle .
NIRV	Job	38	24	Where does lightning come from ? Where do the east winds live that blow across the earth ?
NIRV	Job	38	25	Who tells the rain where it should fall ? Who makes paths for the thunderstorms ?
NIRV	Job	38	26	They bring water to places where no one lives . They water deserts that do not have anyone in them .
NIRV	Job	38	27	They satisfy the needs of dry and empty lands . They make grass start growing there .

NIRV	Job	39	14	Ostriches lay their eggs on the ground . They let them get warm in the sand .
NIRV	Job	39	15	They do not know that something might step on them . A wild animal might walk all over them .
NIRV	Job	39	16	Ostriches are mean to their little ones . They treat them as if they did not belong to them . They do not care that their work was useless .
NIRV	Job	39	17	I did not provide ostriches with wisdom . I did not give them good sense .

NIRV	Job	39	23	Many arrows rattle at their sides . Flashing spears and javelins are also there .
NIRV	Job	39	24	They are so excited that they race over the ground . They can ’ t stand still when trumpets are blown .
NIRV	Job	39	25	When they hear the trumpets they snort , ‘ Aha ! ’ They catch the smells of battle far away . They hear the shouts of commanders and the battle cries .
NIRV	Job	39	26	“ Job , are you wise enough to teach hawks where to fly ? They spread their wings and fly toward the south .
NIRV	Job	39	27	Do you command eagles to fly so high ? They build their nests as high as they can .
NIRV	Job	39	28	They live on cliffs and stay there at night . High up on the rocks they think they are safe .

NIRV	Job	40	16	Look at the strength it has in its hips ! What power it has in the muscles of its stomach !
NIRV	Job	40	17	Its tail sways back and forth like a cedar tree . The tendons of its thighs are close together .
NIRV	Job	40	18	Its bones are like tubes made out of bronze . Its legs are like rods made out of iron .

NIRV	Job	41	29	A club seems like a piece of straw to it . It laughs when it hears a javelin rattling .
NIRV	Job	41	30	Its undersides are like broken pieces of pottery . It leaves a trail in the mud like a threshing sled .
NIRV	Job	41	31	It makes the ocean churn like a boiling pot . It stirs up the sea like perfume someone is making .
NIRV	Job	41	32	It leaves a shiny trail behind it . You would think the ocean had white hair .
NIRV	Job	41	33	Nothing on earth is equal to Leviathan . That creature is not afraid of anything .
NIRV	Job	41	34	It looks down on proud people . It rules over all those who are proud. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Job	42	42	Job replied to the Lord ,
NIRV	Job	42	2	“ I know that you can do anything . No one can keep you from doing what you plan to do .
NIRV	Job	42	3	You asked me , ‘ Who do you think you are to disagree with my plans ? You do not know what you are talking about. ’ I spoke about things I didn ’ t completely understand . I talked about things that were too wonderful for me to know .
NIRV	Job	42	4	“ You said , ‘ Listen now , and I will speak . I will ask you some questions . Then I want you to answer me. ’
NIRV	Job	42	5	My ears had heard about you . But now my own eyes have seen you .
NIRV	Job	42	6	So I hate myself . I ’ m really sorry for what I said about you . That ’ s why I ’ m sitting in dust and ashes. ” The Story Ends
NIRV	Job	42	7	After the Lord finished speaking to Job , he spoke to Eliphaz the Temanite . He said , “ I am angry with you and your two friends . You have not said what is true about me , as my servant Job has .
NIRV	Job	42	8	So now get seven bulls and seven rams . Go to my servant Job . Then sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves . My servant Job will pray for you . And I will accept his prayer . I will not punish you for saying the foolish things you said . You have not said what is true about me , as my servant Job has. ”
NIRV	Job	42	9	So Eliphaz the Temanite , Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite did what the Lord told them to do . And the Lord accepted Job ’ s prayer .
NIRV	Job	42	10	After Job had prayed for his friends , the Lord made him successful again . He gave him twice as much as he had before .
NIRV	Job	42	11	All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came to see him . They ate with him in his house . They showed their concern for him . They comforted him because of all the troubles the Lord had brought on him . Each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring .
NIRV	Job	42	12	The Lord blessed the last part of Job ’ s life even more than the first part . He gave Job 14,000 sheep and 6,000 camels . He gave him 1,000 pairs of oxen and 1,000 donkeys .
NIRV	Job	42	13	Job also had seven sons and three daughters .
NIRV	Job	42	14	He named the first daughter Jemimah . He named the second Keziah . And he named the third Keren-Happuch .
NIRV	Job	42	15	Job ’ s daughters were more beautiful than any other women in the whole land . Their father gave them a share of property along with their brothers .
NIRV	Job	42	16	After all of that happened , Job lived for
NIRV	Job	42	140	years . He saw his children , his grandchildren and his great-grandchildren .
NIRV	Job	42	17	And so Job died . He had lived for a very long time . Copyright ©

NIRV	Psalms	39	1	I said , “ I will be careful about how I live . I will not sin by what I say . I will keep my mouth closed when I am near sinful people. ”
NIRV	Psalms	39	2	So I was completely silent . I didn ’ t even say anything good . But the pain inside me grew worse .
NIRV	Psalms	39	3	My heart was deeply troubled . As I thought about what was happening to me , I became even more troubled . Then I spoke out .
NIRV	Psalms	39	4	I said , “ Lord , show me when my life will end . Show me how many days I have left . Tell me how short my life will be .

NIRV	Psalms	49	5	Why should I be afraid when trouble comes ? Why should I fear when sinners are all around me ? They are the kind of people who want to take advantage of me .
NIRV	Psalms	49	6	They trust in their wealth . They brag about how rich they are .
NIRV	Psalms	49	7	No one can pay for the life of anyone else . No one can give God what that would cost .

NIRV	Psalms	49	15	But God will save me from the place of the dead . He will certainly take me to himself .
NIRV	Psalms	49	16	Don ’ t get too upset when other people become rich . Don ’ t be troubled when they become more and more wealthy .
NIRV	Psalms	49	17	They won ’ t take anything with them when they die . Their riches won ’ t go down to the grave with them .
NIRV	Psalms	49	18	While they lived , they believed they were blessed . People praised them when things were going well for them .
NIRV	Psalms	49	19	But they will die , like their people of long ago . They will never again see the light of life .
NIRV	Psalms	49	20	People who have riches but don ’ t understand are like the animals . They die . Copyright ©

NIRV	Psalms	73	73	A psalm of Asaph .
NIRV	Psalms	73	1	God is truly good to Israel . He is good to those who have pure hearts .
NIRV	Psalms	73	2	But my feet had almost slipped . I had almost tripped and fallen .
NIRV	Psalms	73	3	I saw that proud and sinful people were doing well . And I began to long for what they had .
NIRV	Psalms	73	4	They don ’ t have any troubles . Their bodies are healthy and strong .
NIRV	Psalms	73	5	They don ’ t have the problems most people have . They don ’ t suffer as other people do .
NIRV	Psalms	73	6	Their pride is like a necklace . They put on meanness as if it were their clothes .
NIRV	Psalms	73	7	Many sins come out of their hard and stubborn hearts . There is no limit to the evil things they can think up .
NIRV	Psalms	73	8	They laugh at others and speak words of hatred . They are proud . They warn others about the harm they can do to them .
NIRV	Psalms	73	9	They brag as if they owned heaven itself . They talk as if they controlled the earth .
NIRV	Psalms	73	10	So people listen to them . They lap up their words like water .
NIRV	Psalms	73	11	They say , “ How would God know what we ’ re doing ? Does the Most High God know anything ? ”
NIRV	Psalms	73	12	Here is what sinful people are like . They don ’ t have a care in the world . They keep getting richer and richer .
NIRV	Psalms	73	13	It seems as if I have kept my heart pure for no reason . It didn ’ t do me any good to wash my hands to show that I wasn ’ t guilty of doing anything wrong .
NIRV	Psalms	73	14	Day after day I ’ ve been in pain . God has punished me in a new way every morning .
NIRV	Psalms	73	15	What if I had talked like that ? Then I wouldn ’ t have been faithful to God ’ s children .
NIRV	Psalms	73	16	I tried to understand it all . But it was more than I could handle .
NIRV	Psalms	73	17	It troubled me until I entered God ’ s temple . Then I understood what will finally happen to bad people .
NIRV	Psalms	73	18	God , I ’ m sure you will make them slip and fall . You will throw them down and destroy them .
NIRV	Psalms	73	19	It will happen very suddenly . A terrible death will take them away completely .
NIRV	Psalms	73	20	A dream goes away when a person wakes up . Lord , it will be like that when you rise up . It will be as if those people were only a dream .
NIRV	Psalms	73	21	At one time my heart was sad and my spirit was bitter .
NIRV	Psalms	73	22	I didn ’ t have any sense . I didn ’ t know anything . I acted like a wild animal toward you .
NIRV	Psalms	73	23	But I am always with you . You hold me by my right hand .
NIRV	Psalms	73	24	You give me wise advice to guide me . And when I die , you will take me away into the glory of heaven .
NIRV	Psalms	73	25	I don ’ t have anyone in heaven but you . I don ’ t want anything on earth besides you .
NIRV	Psalms	73	26	My body and my heart may grow weak . God , you give strength to my heart . You are everything I will ever need .
NIRV	Psalms	73	27	Those who don ’ t want anything to do with you will die . You destroy all those who aren ’ t faithful to you .
NIRV	Psalms	73	28	But I am close to you . And that ’ s good . Lord and King , I have made you my place of safety . I will talk about everything you have done . Copyright ©

NIRV	Psalms	74	1	God , why have you turned your back on us for so long ? Why are you so angry with us ? We are your very own sheep .

NIRV	Psalms	74	3	Walk through this place that has been torn down beyond repair . See how completely your enemies have destroyed the temple !
NIRV	Psalms	74	4	In the place where you used to meet with us , your enemies have shouted , “ We ’ ve won the battle ! ” They have set up their flags to show they have beaten us .
NIRV	Psalms	74	5	They acted like people cutting down a forest with axes .
NIRV	Psalms	74	6	They smashed all the beautiful wooden walls with their axes and hatchets .
NIRV	Psalms	74	7	They burned your temple to the ground . They polluted the place where your Name is .
NIRV	Psalms	74	8	They had said in their hearts , “ We will crush them completely ! ” They burned every place where you were worshiped in the land .
NIRV	Psalms	74	9	We don ’ t get signs from God anymore . There aren ’ t any prophets left . None of us knows how long that will last .
NIRV	Psalms	74	10	God , how long will your enemies make fun of you ? Will they attack you with their words forever ?
NIRV	Psalms	74	11	Why don ’ t you help us ? Why do you hold back your power ? Use your strong power to destroy your enemies !
NIRV	Psalms	74	12	God , you have been my king for a long time . You are the only God who can save anyone on earth .
NIRV	Psalms	74	13	You parted the waters of the Red Sea by your power . You broke the heads of that sea monster in Egypt .
NIRV	Psalms	74	14	You crushed the heads of the sea monster Leviathan . You fed it to the creatures of the desert .
NIRV	Psalms	74	15	You opened up streams and springs . You dried up rivers that flow all year long .
NIRV	Psalms	74	16	You rule over the day and the night . You created the sun and the moon .
NIRV	Psalms	74	17	You decided where the borders of the earth would be . You made both summer and winter .
NIRV	Psalms	74	18	Lord , remember how your enemies have made fun of you . Remember how foolish people have attacked you with their words .
NIRV	Psalms	74	19	Don ’ t hand over Israel , your dove , to those wild animals . Don ’ t forget your suffering people forever .
NIRV	Psalms	74	20	Honor the covenant you made with us . Horrible things are happening in every dark corner of the land .
NIRV	Psalms	74	21	Don ’ t let your suffering people be put to shame . May those who are poor and needy praise you .
NIRV	Psalms	74	22	God , rise up . Stand up for your cause . Remember how foolish people make fun of you all day long .

NIRV	Psalms	75	1	God , we praise you . We praise you because you are near to us . People talk about the wonderful things you have done .
NIRV	Psalms	75	2	You say , “ I choose the appointed time to judge people . And I judge them fairly .
NIRV	Psalms	75	3	When the earth and all its people tremble , I keep everything from falling to pieces .
NIRV	Psalms	75	4	To the proud I say , ‘ Don ’ t brag anymore. ’ To sinners I say , ‘ Don ’ t show off your power .
NIRV	Psalms	75	5	Don ’ t show it off against me . Don ’ t talk back to me. ’ ”
NIRV	Psalms	75	6	No one from east or west or north or south can judge themselves .
NIRV	Psalms	75	7	God is the one who judges . He says to one person , “ You are guilty. ” To another he says , “ You are not guilty. ”
NIRV	Psalms	75	8	In the hand of the Lord is a cup . It is full of wine mixed with spices . It is the wine of his anger . He pours it out . All the evil people on earth drink it down to the very last drop .

NIRV	Psalms	76	1	In the land of Judah , God is well known . In Israel , his name is great .
NIRV	Psalms	76	2	His tent is in Jerusalem . The place where he lives is on Mount Zion .
NIRV	Psalms	76	3	There he broke the deadly arrows of his enemies . He broke their shields and swords . He broke their weapons of war .
NIRV	Psalms	76	4	God , you shine like a very bright light . You are more majestic than mountains full of wild animals .
NIRV	Psalms	76	5	Brave soldiers have been robbed of everything they had . Now they lie there , sleeping in death . Not one of them can even lift his hands .
NIRV	Psalms	76	6	God of Jacob , at your command both horse and chariot lie still .
NIRV	Psalms	76	7	People should have respect for you alone . Who can stand in front of you when you are angry ?
NIRV	Psalms	76	8	From heaven you handed down your sentence . The land was afraid and became quiet .

NIRV	Psalms	77	77	For the director of music . For Jeduthun . A psalm of Asaph .
NIRV	Psalms	77	1	I cried out to God for help . I cried out to God to hear me .
NIRV	Psalms	77	2	When I was in trouble , I looked to the Lord for help . During the night I lifted up my hands in prayer . But I refused to be comforted .
NIRV	Psalms	77	3	God , I remembered you , and I groaned . I thought about you , and I became weak .
NIRV	Psalms	77	4	You kept me from going to sleep . I was so troubled I couldn ’ t speak .
NIRV	Psalms	77	5	I thought about days gone by . I thought about the years of long ago .
NIRV	Psalms	77	6	I remembered how I used to sing praise to you in the night . I thought about it , and here is what I asked myself .
NIRV	Psalms	77	7	“ Will the Lord turn away from us forever ? Won ’ t he ever show us his kindness again ?
NIRV	Psalms	77	8	Has his faithful love disappeared forever ? Has his promise failed for all time ?
NIRV	Psalms	77	9	Has God forgotten to help us ? Has he held back his tender love because he was angry ? ”
NIRV	Psalms	77	10	Then I thought , “ Here is what gives me hope . For many years the Most High God showed how powerful he is .
NIRV	Psalms	77	11	Lord , I will remember what you did . Yes , I will remember your miracles of long ago .
NIRV	Psalms	77	12	I will spend time thinking about everything you have done . I will consider all your mighty acts. ”
NIRV	Psalms	77	13	God , everything you do is holy . What god is as great as our God ?
NIRV	Psalms	77	14	You are the God who does miracles . You show your power among the nations .
NIRV	Psalms	77	15	With your mighty arm you set your people free . You set the children of Jacob and Joseph free .
NIRV	Psalms	77	16	God , the water of the Red Sea saw you . It saw you and boiled up . The deepest waters were stirred up .
NIRV	Psalms	77	17	The clouds poured down rain . The skies rumbled with thunder . Lightning flashed back and forth like arrows .
NIRV	Psalms	77	18	Your thunder was heard in the windstorm . Your lightning lit up the world . The earth trembled and shook .
NIRV	Psalms	77	19	Your path led through the Red Sea . You walked through the mighty waters . But your footprints were not seen .
NIRV	Psalms	77	20	You led your people like a flock . You led them by the hands of Moses and Aaron . Copyright ©

NIRV	Psalms	78	78	A maskil of Asaph .
NIRV	Psalms	78	1	My people , listen to my teaching . Pay attention to what I say .
NIRV	Psalms	78	2	I will open my mouth and tell a story . I will speak about things that were hidden . They happened a long time ago .
NIRV	Psalms	78	3	We have heard about them and we know them . Our people who lived before us have told us about them .
NIRV	Psalms	78	4	We won ’ t hide them from our children . We will tell them to those who live after us . We will tell them what the Lord has done that is worthy of praise . We will talk about his power and the wonderful things he has done .
NIRV	Psalms	78	5	He gave laws to the people of Jacob . He gave Israel their law . He commanded our people who lived before us to teach his laws to their children .
NIRV	Psalms	78	6	Then those born later would know his laws . Even their children yet to come would know them . And they in turn would tell their children .
NIRV	Psalms	78	7	Then they would put their trust in God . They would not forget what he had done . They would obey his commands .
NIRV	Psalms	78	8	They would not be like their people who lived long ago . Those people were stubborn . They refused to obey God . They turned away from him . Their spirits were not faithful to him .
NIRV	Psalms	78	9	The soldiers of Ephraim were armed with bows . But they ran away on the day of battle .
NIRV	Psalms	78	10	They didn ’ t keep the covenant God had made with them . They refused to live by his law .
NIRV	Psalms	78	11	They forgot what he had done . They didn ’ t remember the wonders he had shown them .
NIRV	Psalms	78	12	He did miracles right in front of their people who lived long ago . At that time they were living in Egypt , in the area of Zoan .
NIRV	Psalms	78	13	God parted the Red Sea and led them through it . He made the water stand up like a wall .
NIRV	Psalms	78	14	He guided them with the cloud during the day . He led them with the light of a fire all night long .
NIRV	Psalms	78	15	He broke the rocks open in the desert . He gave them as much water as there is in the oceans .
NIRV	Psalms	78	16	He brought streams out of a rocky cliff . He made water flow down like rivers .
NIRV	Psalms	78	17	But they continued to sin against him . In the desert they refused to obey the Most High God .
NIRV	Psalms	78	18	They were stubborn and tested God . They ordered him to give them the food they wanted .
NIRV	Psalms	78	19	They spoke against God . They said , “ Can God really put food on a table in the desert ?
NIRV	Psalms	78	20	It is true that he struck the rock , and streams of water poured out . Huge amounts of water flowed down . But can he also give us bread ? Can he supply meat for his people ? ”
NIRV	Psalms	78	21	When the Lord heard what they said , he was very angry . His anger broke out like fire against the people of Jacob . He became very angry with Israel .
NIRV	Psalms	78	22	That was because they didn ’ t believe in God . They didn ’ t trust in his power to save them .
NIRV	Psalms	78	23	But he gave a command to the skies above . He opened the doors of the heavens .
NIRV	Psalms	78	24	He rained down manna for the people to eat . He gave them the grain of heaven .
NIRV	Psalms	78	25	Mere human beings ate the bread of angels . He sent them all the food they could eat .
NIRV	Psalms	78	26	He made the east wind blow from the heavens . By his power he caused the south wind to blow .
NIRV	Psalms	78	27	He rained down meat on them like dust . He sent them birds like sand on the seashore .
NIRV	Psalms	78	28	He made the birds come down inside their camp . The birds fell all around their tents .
NIRV	Psalms	78	29	People ate until they couldn ’ t eat any more . He gave them what they had wanted .
NIRV	Psalms	78	30	But even before they had finished eating , God acted . He did it while the food was still in their mouths .
NIRV	Psalms	78	31	His anger rose up against them . He put to death the strongest among them . He struck down Israel ’ s young men .
NIRV	Psalms	78	32	But even after all that , they kept on sinning . Even after the wonderful things he had done , they still didn ’ t believe .
NIRV	Psalms	78	33	So he brought their days to an end like a puff of smoke . He ended their years with terror .
NIRV	Psalms	78	34	Every time God killed some of them , the others would seek him . They gladly turned back to him again .
NIRV	Psalms	78	35	They remembered that God was their Rock . They remembered that God Most High had set them free .
NIRV	Psalms	78	36	But they didn ’ t mean it when they praised him . They lied to him when they spoke .
NIRV	Psalms	78	37	They turned away from him . They weren ’ t faithful to the covenant he had made with them .
NIRV	Psalms	78	38	But he was full of tender love . He forgave their sins and didn ’ t destroy his people . Time after time he held back his anger . He didn ’ t let all his burning anger blaze out .
NIRV	Psalms	78	39	He remembered that they were only human . He remembered they were only a breath of air that drifts by and doesn ’ t return .
NIRV	Psalms	78	40	How often they refused to obey him in the desert ! How often they caused him sorrow in that dry and empty land !
NIRV	Psalms	78	41	Again and again they tested God . They made the Holy One of Israel sad and angry .
NIRV	Psalms	78	42	They didn ’ t remember his power . They forgot the day he set them free from those who had treated them so badly .
NIRV	Psalms	78	43	They forgot how he had shown them his signs in Egypt . They forgot his miracles in the area of Zoan .
NIRV	Psalms	78	44	He turned the river of Egypt into blood . The people of Egypt couldn ’ t drink water from their streams .
NIRV	Psalms	78	45	He sent large numbers of flies that bit them . He sent frogs that destroyed their land .
NIRV	Psalms	78	46	He gave their crops to the grasshoppers . He gave their food to the locusts .
NIRV	Psalms	78	47	He destroyed their vines with hail . He destroyed their fig trees with sleet .
NIRV	Psalms	78	48	He killed their cattle with hail . Their livestock were struck by lightning .
NIRV	Psalms	78	49	Because he was so angry with Egypt , he caused them to have great trouble . In his great anger he sent destroying angels against them .
NIRV	Psalms	78	50	God prepared a path for his anger . He didn ’ t spare their lives . He gave them over to the plague .
NIRV	Psalms	78	51	He killed the oldest son of each family in Egypt . He struck down the oldest son in every house in the land of Ham .
NIRV	Psalms	78	52	But he brought his people out like a flock . He led them like sheep through the desert .
NIRV	Psalms	78	53	He guided them safely , and they weren ’ t afraid . But the Red Sea swallowed up their enemies .
NIRV	Psalms	78	54	And so he brought his people to the border of his holy land . He led them to the central hill country he had taken by his power .
NIRV	Psalms	78	55	He drove out the nations to make room for his people . He gave to each family a piece of land to pass on to their children . He gave the tribes of Israel a place to make their homes .
NIRV	Psalms	78	56	But they tested God . They refused to obey the Most High God . They didn ’ t keep his laws .
NIRV	Psalms	78	57	They were like their people who lived long ago . They turned away from him and were not faithful . They were like a bow that doesn ’ t shoot straight . They couldn ’ t be trusted .
NIRV	Psalms	78	58	They made God angry by going to their high places . They made him jealous by worshiping the statues of their gods .
NIRV	Psalms	78	59	When God saw what the people were doing , he was very angry . He turned away from them completely .
NIRV	Psalms	78	60	He deserted the holy tent at Shiloh . He left the tent he had set up among his people .
NIRV	Psalms	78	61	He allowed the ark to be captured . Into the hands of his enemies he sent the ark where his glory rested .
NIRV	Psalms	78	62	He let his people be killed by swords . He was very angry with them .
NIRV	Psalms	78	63	Fire destroyed their young men . Their young women had no one to marry .
NIRV	Psalms	78	64	Their priests were killed by swords . Their widows weren ’ t able to weep .
NIRV	Psalms	78	65	Then the Lord woke up as if he had been sleeping . He was like a warrior waking up from the deep sleep caused by wine .
NIRV	Psalms	78	66	He drove back his enemies . He put them to shame that will last forever .
NIRV	Psalms	78	67	He turned his back on the tents of the people of Joseph . He didn ’ t choose to live in the tribe of Ephraim .
NIRV	Psalms	78	68	Instead , he chose to live in the tribe of Judah . He chose Mount Zion , which he loved .
NIRV	Psalms	78	69	There he built his holy place as secure as the heavens . He built it to last forever , like the earth .
NIRV	Psalms	78	70	He chose his servant David . He took him from the sheep pens .
NIRV	Psalms	78	71	He brought him from tending sheep to be the shepherd of his people Jacob . He made him the shepherd of Israel , his special people .
NIRV	Psalms	78	72	David cared for them with a faithful and honest heart . With skilled hands he led them . Copyright ©

NIRV	Psalms	80	9	You prepared the ground for it . It took root and spread out over the whole land .
NIRV	Psalms	80	10	The mountains were covered with its shade . The shade of its branches covered the mighty cedar trees .
NIRV	Psalms	80	11	Your vine sent its branches out all the way to the Mediterranean Sea . They reached as far as the Euphrates River .

NIRV	Proverbs	30	31	The second is a rooster , which walks proudly . The third is a billy goat . And the fourth is a king , who is secure against any who might oppose him .
NIRV	Proverbs	30	32	“ Do you do foolish things ? Do you think you are better than others ? Do you plan evil ? If you do , put your hand over your mouth and stop talking !
NIRV	Proverbs	30	33	If you churn cream , you will produce butter . If you twist a nose , you will produce blood . And if you stir up anger , you will produce a fight. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Proverbs	31	4	Lemuel , it isn ’ t good for kings to drink wine . It isn ’ t good for rulers to long for beer .
NIRV	Proverbs	31	5	If they do , they might drink and forget what has been commanded . They might take away the rights of all those who are treated badly .

NIRV	Proverbs	31	10	Who can find an excellent woman ? She is worth far more than rubies .
NIRV	Proverbs	31	11	Her husband trusts her completely . She gives him all the important things he needs .
NIRV	Proverbs	31	12	She brings him good , not harm , all the days of her life .
NIRV	Proverbs	31	13	She chooses wool and flax . She loves to work with her hands .
NIRV	Proverbs	31	14	She is like the ships of traders . She brings her food from far away .
NIRV	Proverbs	31	15	She gets up while it is still night . She provides food for her family . She also gives some to her female servants .
NIRV	Proverbs	31	16	She considers a field and buys it . She uses some of the money she earns to plant a vineyard .
NIRV	Proverbs	31	17	She gets ready to work hard . Her arms are strong .
NIRV	Proverbs	31	18	She sees that her trading earns a lot of money . Her lamp doesn ’ t go out at night .
NIRV	Proverbs	31	19	With one hand she holds the wool . With the other she spins the thread .

NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	1	These are the words of the Teacher . He was the son of David . He was also the king in Jerusalem .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	2	“ Meaningless ! Everything is meaningless ! ” says the Teacher . “ Everything is completely meaningless ! Nothing has any meaning. ”
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	3	What do people get for all their work ? Why do they work so hard on this earth ?
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	4	People come and people go . But the earth remains forever .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	5	The sun rises . Then it sets . And then it hurries back to where it rises .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	6	The wind blows to the south . Then it turns to the north . Around and around it goes . It always returns to where it started .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	7	Every stream flows into the ocean . But the ocean never gets full . The streams return to the place they came from .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	8	All things are tiresome . They are more tiresome than anyone can say . But our eyes never see enough of anything . Our ears never hear enough .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	9	Everything that has ever been will come back again . Everything that has ever been done will be done again . Nothing is new on earth .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	10	There isn ’ t anything about which someone can say , “ Look ! Here ’ s something new. ” It was already here long ago . It was here before we were .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	11	No one remembers the people of long ago . Even those who haven ’ t been born yet won ’ t be remembered by those who will be born after them . Wisdom Is Meaningless
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	12	I , the Teacher , was king over Israel in Jerusalem .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	13	I decided to study things carefully . I used my wisdom to check everything out . I looked into everything that is done on earth . What a heavy load God has put on human beings !
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	14	I ’ ve seen what is done on this earth . All of it is meaningless . It ’ s like chasing the wind .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	15	People can ’ t straighten things that are crooked . They can ’ t count things that don ’ t even exist .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	16	I said to myself , “ Look , I ’ ve now grown wiser than anyone who ruled over Jerusalem in the past . I have a lot of wisdom and knowledge. ”
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	17	Then I used my mind to understand what it really means to be wise . And I wanted to know what foolish pleasure is all about . But I found out that it ’ s also like chasing the wind .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	1	18	A lot of human wisdom leads to a lot of sorrow . More knowledge only brings more sadness . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	2	“ Laughter doesn ’ t make any sense , ” I said . “ And what can pleasure do for me ? ”
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	3	I tried cheering myself up by drinking wine . I even tried living in a foolish way . But wisdom was still guiding my mind . I wanted to see what was good for people to do on earth during their short lives .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	4	So I started some large projects . I built houses for myself . I planted vineyards .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	5	I made gardens and parks . I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	6	I made lakes to water groves of healthy trees .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	7	I bought male and female slaves . And I had other slaves who were born in my house . I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem ever had before .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	8	I stored up silver and gold for myself . I gathered up the treasures of kings and their kingdoms . I got some male and female singers . I also got many women for myself . Women delight the hearts of men .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	9	I became far more important than anyone in Jerusalem had ever been before . And in spite of everything , I didn ’ t lose my wisdom .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	10	I gave myself everything my eyes wanted . There wasn ’ t any pleasure that I refused to give myself . I took delight in everything I did . And that was what I got for all my work .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	11	But then I looked over everything my hands had done . I saw what I had worked so hard to get . And nothing had any meaning . It was like chasing the wind . Nothing was gained on this earth . Wisdom and Foolish Pleasure Are Meaningless
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	12	I decided to think about wisdom . I also thought about foolish pleasure . What more can a new king do ? Can he do anything more than others have already done ?
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	13	I saw that wisdom is better than foolishness , just as light is better than darkness .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	14	The eyes of a wise person see things clearly . A person who is foolish lives in darkness . But I finally realized that death catches up with both of them .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	15	Then I said to myself , “ What happens to a foolish person will catch up with me too . So what do I gain by being wise ? ” I said to myself , “ That doesn ’ t have any meaning either. ”
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	16	Like a foolish person , a wise person won ’ t be remembered very long . The days have already come when both of them have been forgotten . Like a person who is foolish , a wise person must die too ! Work Is Meaningless
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	17	So I hated life . That ’ s because the work done on this earth made me sad . None of it has any meaning . It ’ s like chasing the wind .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	18	I hated everything I had worked for on earth . I ’ ll have to leave all of it to someone who lives after me .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	19	And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish ? Either way , they ’ ll take over everything on earth I ’ ve worked so hard for . That doesn ’ t have any meaning either .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	20	So I began to lose hope because of all my hard work on this earth .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	21	A person might use wisdom , knowledge and skill to do their work . But then they have to leave everything they own to someone who hasn ’ t worked for it . That doesn ’ t have any meaning either . In fact , it isn ’ t fair .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	22	What do people get for all their hard work on earth ? What do they get for all their worries ?
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	23	As long as they live , their work is nothing but pain and sorrow . Even at night their minds can ’ t rest . That doesn ’ t have any meaning either .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	24	A person can ’ t do anything better than eat , drink and be satisfied with their work . I ’ m finally seeing that those things also come from the hand of God .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	25	Without his help , who can eat or find pleasure ?
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	2	26	God gives wisdom , knowledge and happiness to the person who pleases him . But to a sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth . Then the sinner must hand it over to the one who pleases God . That doesn ’ t have any meaning either . It ’ s like chasing the wind . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	2	There is a time to be born . And there ’ s a time to die . There is a time to plant . And there ’ s a time to pull up what is planted .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	4	There is a time to weep . And there ’ s a time to laugh . There is a time to be sad . And there ’ s a time to dance .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	5	There is a time to scatter stones . And there ’ s a time to gather them . There is a time to embrace someone . And there ’ s a time not to embrace .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	6	There is a time to search . And there ’ s a time to stop searching . There is a time to keep . And there ’ s a time to throw away .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	7	There is a time to tear . And there ’ s a time to mend . There is a time to be silent . And there ’ s a time to speak .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	8	There is a time to love . And there ’ s a time to hate . There is a time for war . And there ’ s a time for peace .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	9	What do workers get for their hard work ?
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	10	I ’ ve seen the heavy load God has put on human beings .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	11	He has made everything beautiful in its time . He has also given people a sense of who he is . But they can ’ t completely understand what God has done from beginning to end .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	12	People should be happy and do good while they live . I know there ’ s nothing better for them to do than that .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	13	Each of them should eat and drink . People should be satisfied with all their hard work . That is God ’ s gift to them .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	14	I know that everything God does will last forever . Nothing can be added to it . And nothing can be taken from it . God does that so people will have respect for him .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	15	Everything that now exists has already been . And what is coming has existed before . God will judge those who treat others badly .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	16	Here ’ s something else I saw on earth . Where people should be treated right , they are treated wrong . Where people should be treated fairly , they are treated unfairly .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	17	I said to myself , “ God will judge godly and sinful people alike . He has a time for every act . He has a time to judge everything that is done. ”
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	18	I also said to myself , “ God tests human beings . He does this so they can see that in certain ways they are like animals .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	19	Surely what happens to animals happens to people too . Death waits for people and animals alike . People die , just as animals do . All of them have the same breath . People don ’ t have any advantage over animals . Nothing has any meaning .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	20	People and animals go to the same place . All of them come from dust . And all of them return to dust .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	21	Who can know whether the spirit of a person goes up ? Who can tell whether the spirit of an animal goes down into the earth ? ”
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	3	22	So a person should enjoy their work . That ’ s what God made them for . I saw that there ’ s nothing better for them to do than that . After all , who can show them what will happen after they are gone ? Copyright ©

NIRV	Ecclesiastes	4	4	I also saw that a person works hard and accomplishes a lot . But they do it only because they want what another person has . That doesn ’ t have any meaning either . It ’ s like chasing the wind .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	4	2	Then I announced that those who have already died are happier than those who are still alive .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	4	3	But someone who hasn ’ t been born yet is better off than the dead or the living . That ’ s because that person hasn ’ t seen the evil things that are done on earth .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	4	5	Foolish people fold their hands and don ’ t work . And that destroys them .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	4	6	One handful with peace and quiet is better than two handfuls with hard work . Working too hard is like chasing the wind .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	4	7	Again I saw something on earth that didn ’ t mean anything .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	4	8	A man lived all by himself . He didn ’ t have any sons or brothers . His hard work never ended . But he wasn ’ t happy with what he had . “ Who am I working so hard for ? ” he asked . “ Why don ’ t I get the things I enjoy ? ” That doesn ’ t have any meaning either . In fact , it ’ s a very bad deal !
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	4	9	Two people are better than one . They can help each other in everything they do .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	4	10	Suppose either of them falls down . Then the one can help the other one up . But suppose a person falls down and doesn ’ t have anyone to help them up . Then feel sorry for that person !
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	4	11	Or suppose two people lie down together . Then they ’ ll keep warm . But how can one person keep warm alone ?
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	4	12	One person could be overpowered . But two people can stand up for themselves . And a rope made out of three cords isn ’ t easily broken . Getting Ahead Is Meaningless
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	4	13	A poor but wise young man is better off than an old but foolish king . That king doesn ’ t pay attention to a warning anymore .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	4	14	The young man might have come from prison to become king . Or he might have been born poor within the kingdom but still became king .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	4	15	I saw that everyone was following the young man who had become the new king .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	4	16	At first , all the people served him when he became king . But those who came later weren ’ t pleased with the way he was ruling . That doesn ’ t have any meaning either . It ’ s like chasing the wind . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	5	It is not good to make a promise and not keep it . It is better to make no promise at all .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	2	Don ’ t be too quick to speak . Don ’ t be in a hurry to say anything to God . God is in heaven . You are on earth . So use only a few words when you speak .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	3	Many worries result in dreams . Many words result in foolish talk .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	4	When you make a promise to God , don ’ t wait too long to carry it out . He isn ’ t pleased with foolish people . So do what you have promised .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	6	Don ’ t let your mouth cause you to sin . Don ’ t say to the temple messenger , “ My promise was a mistake. ” Why should God be angry with what you say ? Why should he destroy what you have done ?
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	7	Dreaming too much and talking too much are meaningless . So have respect for God . Riches Are Meaningless
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	8	Suppose you see poor people being mistreated somewhere . And what is being done to them isn ’ t right or fair . Don ’ t be surprised by that . One official is watched by a higher one . Officials who are even higher are watching both of them .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	9	All of them take what the land produces . And the king himself takes his share from the fields .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	10	Anyone who loves money never has enough . Anyone who loves wealth is never satisfied with what they get . That doesn ’ t have any meaning either .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	11	As more and more goods are made , more and more people use them up . So how can those goods benefit their owners ? All they can do is look at them with desire .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	12	The sleep of a worker is sweet . It doesn ’ t matter whether they eat a little or a lot . But the wealth of rich people keeps them awake at night .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	13	I ’ ve seen something very evil on earth . It ’ s when wealth is stored up and then brings harm to its owners .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	14	It ’ s also when wealth is lost because of an unwise business deal . Then there won ’ t be anything left for the owners ’ children .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	15	Everyone is born naked . They come into the world with nothing . And they go out of it with nothing . They don ’ t get anything from their work that they can take with them .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	16	Here ’ s something else that is very evil . Everyone is born , and everyone dies . And what do they get for their work ? Nothing . It ’ s like working for the wind .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	17	All their lives they eat in darkness . Their lives are full of trouble , suffering and anger .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	18	I have seen what is good . It is good for a person to eat and drink . It ’ s good for them to be satisfied with their hard work on this earth . That ’ s what they should do during the short life God has given them . That ’ s what God made them for .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	19	Sometimes God gives a person wealth and possessions . God makes it possible for that person to enjoy them . God helps them accept the life he has given them . God helps them to be happy in their work . All these things are gifts from God .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	5	20	A person like that doesn ’ t have to think about how their life is going . That ’ s because God fills their heart with joy . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ecclesiastes	6	6	And that ’ s true even if he lives for 2,000 years but doesn ’ t get to enjoy his wealth . All people die and go to the grave , don ’ t they ?
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	6	2	God gives some people wealth , possessions and honor . They have everything their hearts desire . But God doesn ’ t let them enjoy those things . Instead , strangers enjoy them . This doesn ’ t have any meaning . It ’ s a very evil thing .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	6	3	A man might have a hundred children . He might live a long time . But suppose he can ’ t enjoy his wealth . And suppose he isn ’ t buried in the proper way . Then it doesn ’ t matter how long he lives . I ’ m telling you that a baby that is born dead is better off than that man is .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	6	4	That kind of birth doesn ’ t have any meaning . The baby dies in darkness and leaves this world . And in darkness it is forgotten .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	6	5	It didn ’ t even see the sun . It didn ’ t know anything at all . But it has more rest than that man does .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	6	7	People eat up everything they work to get . But they are never satisfied .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	6	8	What advantage do wise people have over those who are foolish ? What do poor people gain by knowing how to act toward others ?
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	6	9	Being satisfied with what you have is better than always wanting more . That doesn ’ t have any meaning either . It ’ s like chasing the wind .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	6	10	God has already planned what now exists . He has already decided what a human being is . No one can argue with someone who is stronger .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	6	11	The more words people use , the less meaning there is . And that doesn ’ t help anyone .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	6	12	Who knows what ’ s good for a person ? They live for only a few meaningless days . They pass through life like a shadow . Who can tell them what will happen on earth after they are gone ? Copyright ©

NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	7	When a wise person takes wealth by force , they become foolish . It is sinful to take money from people who want special favors .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	2	So it ’ s better to go where people are mourning than to go where people are having a good time . Everyone will die someday . Those who are still living should really think about that .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	3	Not being able to figure things out is better than laughter . That ’ s because sorrow is good for the heart .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	4	Those who are wise are found where there is sorrow . But foolish people are found where there is pleasure .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	5	Pay attention to a wise person ’ s warning . That ’ s better than listening to the songs of those who are foolish .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	6	A foolish person ’ s laughter is like the crackling of thorns burning under a pot . That doesn ’ t have any meaning either .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	8	The end of a matter is better than its beginning . So it ’ s better to be patient than proud .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	9	Don ’ t become angry quickly . Anger lives in the hearts of foolish people .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	10	Don ’ t say , “ Why were things better in the good old days ? ” It isn ’ t wise to ask that kind of question .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	11	Wisdom is a good thing . It ’ s like getting a share of the family wealth . It benefits those who live on this earth .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	12	Wisdom provides safety , just as money provides safety . But here ’ s the advantage of wisdom . It guards those who have it .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	13	Think about what God has done . Who can make straight what he has made crooked ?
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	14	When times are good , be happy . But when times are bad , here ’ s something to think about . God has made bad times . He has also made good times . So no one can find out anything about what ’ s ahead for them .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	15	In my meaningless life here ’ s what I ’ ve seen . I ’ ve seen godly people dying even though they are godly . And I ’ ve seen sinful people living a long time even though they are sinful .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	16	Don ’ t claim to be better than you are . And don ’ t claim to be wiser than you are . Why destroy yourself ?
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	17	Don ’ t be too sinful . And don ’ t be foolish . Why die before your time comes ?
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	18	It ’ s good to hold on to both of those things . Don ’ t let go of either one . Whoever has respect for God will avoid going too far in either direction .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	19	Wisdom makes one wise person more powerful than ten rulers in a city .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	20	It is true that there isn ’ t anyone on earth who does only what is right and never sins .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	21	Don ’ t pay attention to everything people say . If you do , you might hear your servant cursing you .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	22	Many times you yourself have cursed others . Deep down inside , you know that ’ s true .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	23	I used wisdom to test all these things . I said , “ I ’ ve made up my mind to be wise. ” But it was more than I could accomplish .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	24	Whatever exists is far away and very deep . Who can find it ?
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	25	So I tried to understand wisdom more completely . I wanted to study it and figure it out . I tried to find out everything I could about it . I tried to understand why it ’ s foolish to be evil . I wanted to see why choosing foolishness is so unwise .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	26	A woman who hunts a man down is more painful than death . Her heart is like a trap . Her hands are like chains . A man who pleases God will try to get away from her . But she will trap a sinner .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	27	“ Look , ” says the Teacher . “ Here ’ s what I ’ ve discovered . “ I added one thing to another to find out everything I could about wisdom .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	28	I searched and searched but found very little . I did find one honest man among a thousand . But I didn ’ t find one honest woman among a thousand .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	7	29	Here ’ s the only other thing I found . God created human beings as honest . But they ’ ve made many evil plans. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Ecclesiastes	8	5	No one who obeys his command will be harmed . Those who are wise will know the proper time and way to approach him .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	8	6	There ’ s a proper time and way for people to do everything . That ’ s true even though a person might be suffering greatly .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	8	7	No one knows what lies ahead . So who can tell someone else what ’ s going to happen ?
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	8	9	I understood all these things . I used my mind to study everything that ’ s done on earth . A man sometimes makes life hard for others . But he ends up hurting himself .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	8	10	I also saw sinful people being buried . They used to come and go from the place of worship . And others praised them in the city where they worshiped . That doesn ’ t have any meaning either .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	8	11	Sometimes the sentence for a crime isn ’ t carried out quickly . So people make plans to commit even more crimes .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	8	12	An evil person may be guilty of a hundred crimes . Yet they may still live a long time . But I know that things will go better with those who have great respect for God .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	8	13	Sinful people don ’ t respect God . So things won ’ t go well with them . Like a shadow , they won ’ t be around very long .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	8	14	Here ’ s something else on this earth that doesn ’ t have any meaning . Sometimes godly people get what sinful people should receive . And sinful people get what godly people should receive . Here ’ s what I ’ m telling you . That doesn ’ t have any meaning either .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	8	15	So I advise everyone to enjoy life . A person on this earth can ’ t do anything better than eat and drink and be glad . Then they will enjoy their work . They ’ ll be happy all the days of the life God has given them on earth .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	8	16	I used my mind to understand what it really means to be wise . I wanted to observe the hard work people do on earth . They don ’ t close their eyes and go to sleep day or night .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	8	17	I saw everything God has done . No one can understand what happens on earth . People might try very hard to figure it out . But they still can ’ t discover what it all means . Wise people might claim they know . But they can ’ t really understand it either . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	9	You love your wife . So enjoy life with her . Do it all the days of this meaningless life God has given you on earth . That ’ s what he made you for . That ’ s what you get for all your hard work on earth .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	2	Everyone will die someday . Death comes to godly and sinful people alike . It comes to good and bad people alike . It comes to “ clean ” and “ unclean ” people alike . Those who offer sacrifices and those who don ’ t offer them also die . A good person dies , and so does a sinner . Those who make promises die . So do those who are afraid to make them .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	3	Here ’ s what is so bad about everything that happens on this earth . Death catches up with all of us . Also , the hearts of people are full of evil . They live in foolish pleasure . After that , they join those who have already died .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	4	Anyone who is still living has hope . Even a live dog is better off than a dead lion !
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	5	People who are still alive know they ’ ll die . But those who have died don ’ t know anything . They don ’ t receive any more rewards . And even their name is forgotten .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	6	Their love , hate and jealousy disappear . They will never share again in anything that happens on earth .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	7	Go and enjoy your food . Be joyful as you drink your wine . God has aleady approved what you do .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	8	Always wear white clothes to show you are happy . Anoint your head with olive oil .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	10	No matter what you do , work at it with all your might . Remember , you are going to the place of the dead . And there isn ’ t any work or planning or knowledge or wisdom there .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	11	Here ’ s something else I ’ ve seen on this earth . Races aren ’ t always won by those who run fast . Battles aren ’ t always won by those who are strong . Wise people don ’ t always have plenty of food . Clever people aren ’ t always wealthy . Those who have learned a lot aren ’ t always successful . God controls the timing of every event . He also controls how things turn out .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	12	No one knows when trouble will come to them . Fish are caught in nets . Birds are taken in traps . And people are trapped by hard times that come when they don ’ t expect them . Being Wise Is Better Than Being Foolish
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	13	Here ’ s something else I saw on this earth . I saw an example of wisdom that touched me deeply .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	14	There was once a small city . Only a few people lived there . A powerful king attacked it . He brought in war machines all around it .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	15	A certain man lived in that city . He was poor but wise . He used his wisdom to save the city . But no one remembered that poor man .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	16	So I said , “ It ’ s better to be wise than to be powerful. ” But people look down on the poor man ’ s wisdom . No one pays any attention to what he says .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	17	People should listen to the quiet words of those who are wise . That ’ s better than paying attention to the shouts of a ruler of foolish people .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	9	18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war . But one sinner destroys a lot of good . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	10	Suppose the blade of an ax is dull . And its edge hasn ’ t been sharpened . Then more effort is needed to use it . But skill will bring success .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	2	The hearts of wise people lead them on the right path . But the hearts of foolish people take them down the wrong path .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	3	Foolish people don ’ t have any sense at all . They show everyone they are foolish . They do it even when they are walking along the road .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	4	Suppose a ruler gets very angry with you . If he does , don ’ t quit your job in the palace . Being calm can overcome what you have done against him .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	5	Here ’ s something evil I ’ ve seen on this earth . And it ’ s the kind of mistake that rulers make .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	6	Foolish people are given many important jobs . Rich people are given unimportant ones .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	7	I ’ ve seen slaves on horseback . I ’ ve also seen princes who were forced to walk as if they were slaves .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	8	Anyone who digs a pit might fall into it . Anyone who breaks through a wall might be bitten by a snake .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	9	Anyone who removes stones from rock pits might get hurt . Anyone who cuts logs might get wounded .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	11	Suppose a snake bites before it is charmed . Then the snake charmer receives no payment .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	12	Wise people say gracious things . But foolish people are destroyed by what their own lips speak .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	13	At first what they say is foolish . In the end their words are very evil .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	14	They talk too much . No one knows what lies ahead . Who can tell someone else what will happen after they are gone ?
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	15	The work foolish people do makes them tired . They don ’ t even know the way to town .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	16	How terrible it is for a land whose king used to be a servant ! How terrible if its princes get drunk in the morning !
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	17	How blessed is the land whose king was born into the royal family ! How blessed if its princes eat and drink at the proper time ! How blessed if they eat and drink to become strong and not to get drunk !
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	18	When a person won ’ t work , the roof falls down . Because of hands that aren ’ t busy , the house leaks .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	19	People laugh at a dinner party . And wine makes life happy . People think money can buy everything .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	10	20	Don ’ t say bad things about the king . Don ’ t even think about those things . Don ’ t curse rich people . Don ’ t even curse them in your bedroom . A bird might fly away and carry your words . It might report what you said . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ecclesiastes	11	11	Sell your grain in the market overseas . After a while you might earn something from it .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	11	2	Try to succeed by doing many things . After all , you don ’ t know what great trouble might come on the land .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	11	3	Clouds that are full of water pour rain down on the earth . A tree might fall to the south or the north . It will stay in the place where it falls .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	11	4	Anyone who keeps on watching the wind won ’ t plant seeds . Anyone who keeps looking at the clouds won ’ t gather crops .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	11	5	You don ’ t know the path the wind takes . You don ’ t know how a baby is made inside its mother . So you can ’ t understand how God works either . He made everything .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	11	6	In the morning plant your seeds . In the evening keep your hands busy . You don ’ t know what will succeed . It may be one or the other . Or both might do equally well . Remember Your Creator While You Are Young
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	11	7	Light is sweet . People enjoy being out in the sun .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	11	8	No matter how many years anyone might live , let them enjoy all of them . But let them remember the dark days . There will be many of those . Nothing that ’ s going to happen will have any meaning .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	11	9	You young people , be happy while you are still young . Let your heart be joyful while you are still strong . Do what your heart tells you to do . Go after what your eyes look at . But I want you to know that God will judge you for everything you do .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	11	10	So drive worry out of your heart . Get rid of all your troubles . Being young and strong doesn ’ t have any meaning . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ecclesiastes	12	12	My son , be careful not to pay attention to anything added to them . Books will never stop being written . Too much studying makes people tired .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	12	2	That ’ s when the sunlight will become dark . The moon and the stars will also grow dark . And the clouds will return after it rains .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	12	3	Remember your Creator before those who guard the house tremble with old age . That ’ s when strong men will be bent over . The women who grind grain will stop because there are so few of them left . Those who look through the windows won ’ t be able to see very well .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	12	4	Remember your Creator before the front doors are closed . That ’ s when the sound of grinding will fade away . Old people will rise up when they hear birds singing . But they will barely hear any of their songs .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	12	5	Remember your Creator before you become afraid of places that are too high . You will also be terrified because of danger in the streets . Remember your Creator before the almond trees have buds on them . That ’ s when grasshoppers will drag themselves along . Old people will lose their desire . That ’ s when people will go to their dark homes in the grave . And those who mourn for the dead will walk around in the streets .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	12	6	Remember your Creator before the silver cord is cut . Remember him before the golden bowl is broken . The wheel will be broken at the well . The pitcher will be smashed at the spring .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	12	7	Remember your Creator before you return to the dust you came from . Remember him before your spirit goes back to God who gave it .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	12	8	“ Meaningless ! Everything is meaningless ! ” says the Teacher . “ Nothing has any meaning. ” Have Respect for God and Obey His Commandments
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	12	9	The Teacher was wise . He gave knowledge to people . He tried out many proverbs . He thought about them carefully . Then he wrote them down in order .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	12	10	He did his best to find just the right words . And what he wrote was honest and true .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	12	11	The sayings of those who are wise move people to take action . Their collected sayings are like nails pounded in firm and deep . These sayings are given to us by one shepherd .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	12	13	Everything has now been heard . And here ’ s the final thing I want to say . Have respect for God and obey his commandments . This is what he expects of all human beings .
NIRV	Ecclesiastes	12	14	God will judge everything people do . That includes everything they try to hide . He ’ ll judge everything , whether it ’ s good or evil . Copyright ©

NIRV	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	6	Don ’ t stare at me because I ’ m dark . The sun has made my skin look like this . My brothers were angry with me . They made me take care of the vineyards . I haven ’ t even taken care of my own vineyard .
NIRV	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	7	“ King Solomon , I love you . So tell me where you take care of your flock . Tell me where you rest your sheep at noon . Why should I have to act like a prostitute near the flocks of your friends ? ” The other women say
NIRV	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	8	“ You are the most beautiful woman of all . Don ’ t you know where to find the king ? Follow the tracks the sheep make . Take care of your young goats near the tents of the shepherds. ” King Solomon says to the Shulammite woman

NIRV	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	3	Those on guard duty found me as they were walking around in the city . ‘ Have you seen the one my heart loves ? ’ I asked .
NIRV	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	2	I will get up and go around in the city . I ’ ll look through all of its streets . I ’ ll search for the one my heart loves . So I looked for him but didn ’ t find him .

NIRV	Isaiah	1	1	Here is the vision about Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah saw . It came to him when Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz and Hezekiah were ruling . They were kings of Judah . Isaiah was the son of Amoz . The Nation Refuses to Obey the Lord
NIRV	Isaiah	1	2	Listen to me , you heavens ! Pay attention to me , earth ! The Lord has said , “ I raised children . I brought them up . But they have refused to obey me .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	3	The ox knows its master . The donkey knows where its owner feeds it . But Israel does not know me . My people do not understand me. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	1	4	How terrible it will be for this sinful nation ! They are loaded down with guilt . They are people who do nothing but evil . They are children who are always sinning . They have deserted the Lord . They have turned against the Holy One of Israel . They have turned their backs on him .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	5	Israel , why do you want to be beaten all the time ? Why do you always refuse to obey the Lord ? Your head is covered with wounds . Your whole heart is weak .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	6	There isn ’ t a healthy spot on your body . You are not healthy from the bottom of your feet to the top of your head . You have nothing but wounds , cuts and open sores . They haven ’ t been cleaned up or bandaged or treated with olive oil .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	7	Your country has been deserted . Your cities have been burned down . The food from your fields is being eaten up by outsiders . They are doing it right in front of you . Your land has been completely destroyed . It looks as if strangers have taken it over .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	8	The city of Zion is left like a shed where someone stands guard in a vineyard . It is left like a hut in a cucumber field . It ’ s like a city being attacked .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	9	The Lord who rules over all has let some people live through that time of trouble . If he hadn ’ t , we would have become like Sodom . We would have been like Gomorrah .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	10	Rulers of Sodom , hear the Lord ’ s message . People of Gomorrah , listen to the instruction of our God .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	11	“ Do you think I need any more of your sacrifices ? ” asks the Lord . “ I have more than enough of your burnt offerings . I have more than enough of rams and the fat of your fattest animals . I do not find any pleasure in the blood of your bulls , lambs and goats .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	12	Who asked you to bring all these animals when you come to worship me ? Who asked you and your animals to walk all over my courtyards ?
NIRV	Isaiah	1	13	Stop bringing offerings that do not mean anything to me ! I hate your incense . I can ’ t stand your worthless gatherings . I can ’ t stand the way you celebrate your New Moon feasts , Sabbath days and special services .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	14	Your New Moon feasts and your other appointed feasts I hate with my whole being . They have become a heavy load to me . I am tired of carrying it .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	15	You might spread out your hands toward me when you pray . But I do not look at you . You might even offer many prayers . But I am not listening to them . Your hands are covered with the blood of the people you have murdered .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	16	So wash and make yourselves clean . Get your evil actions out of my sight ! Stop doing what is wrong !
NIRV	Isaiah	1	17	Learn to do what is right ! Treat people fairly . Help those who are treated badly . Stand up in court for children whose fathers have died . And do the same thing for widows .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	18	“ Come . Let us settle this matter , ” says the Lord . “ Even though your sins are bright red , they will be as white as snow . Even though they are deep red , they will be white like wool .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	19	But you have to be willing to change and obey me . If you are , you will eat the good things that grow on the land .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	20	But if you are not willing to obey me , you will be killed by swords. ” The Lord has spoken .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	21	See how the faithful city of Jerusalem has become like a prostitute ! Once it was full of people who treated others fairly . Those who did what was right used to live in it . But now murderers live there !
NIRV	Isaiah	1	22	Jerusalem , your silver isn ’ t pure anymore . Your best wine has been made weak with water .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	23	Your rulers refuse to obey the Lord . They join forces with robbers . All of them love to accept money from those who want special favors . They are always looking for gifts from other people . They don ’ t stand up in court for children whose fathers have died . They don ’ t do it for widows either .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	24	The Lord is the Mighty One of Israel . The Lord who rules over all announces , “ Israel , you have become my enemies . I will act against you in my anger . I will pay you back for what you have done .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	25	I will turn my power against you . I will make you completely ‘ clean. ’ I will remove everything that is not pure .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	26	I will give you leaders like the ones you had long ago . I will give you rulers like those you had at the beginning . Then you will be called the City That Does What Is Right . You will also be called the Faithful City. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	1	27	Zion will be saved when justice is done . Those who are sorry for their sins will be saved when what is right is done .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	28	But sinners and those who refuse to obey the Lord will be destroyed . And those who desert the Lord will die .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	29	“ Israel , you take delight in worshiping among the sacred oak trees . You will be full of shame for doing that . You have chosen to worship in the sacred gardens . You will be dishonored for doing that .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	30	You will be like an oak tree whose leaves are dying . You will be like a garden that doesn ’ t have any water .
NIRV	Isaiah	1	31	Your strongest men will become like dry pieces of wood . Their worship of other gods will be the spark that lights the fire . Everything will be burned up . No one will be there to put the fire out. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	2	2	In the last days the mountain where the Lord ’ s temple is located will be famous . It will be the highest mountain of all . It will be raised above the hills . All the nations will go to it .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	3	People from many nations will go there . They will say , “ Come . Let us go up to the Lord ’ s mountain . Let ’ s go to the temple of Jacob ’ s God . He will teach us how we should live . Then we will live the way he wants us to. ” The law of the Lord will be taught at Zion . His message will go out from Jerusalem .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	4	He will judge between the nations . He ’ ll settle problems among many of them . They will hammer their swords into plows . They ’ ll hammer their spears into pruning tools . Nations will not go to war against one another . They won ’ t even train to fight anymore .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	5	People of Jacob , come . Let us live the way the Lord has taught us to . The Day of the Lord Is Coming
NIRV	Isaiah	2	6	Lord , you have deserted the people of Jacob . They are your people . The land is full of false beliefs from the east . The people practice evil magic , just as the Philistines do . They do what ungodly people do .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	7	Their land is full of silver and gold . There is no end to their treasures . Their land is full of horses . There is no end to their chariots .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	8	Their land is full of statues of gods . Their people bow down to what their own hands have made . They bow down to what their fingers have shaped .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	9	So people will be brought low . Everyone will be made humble . Do not forgive them .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	10	Go and hide in caves in the rocks , you people ! Hide in holes in the ground . Hide from the terrifying presence of the Lord ! Hide when he comes in glory and majesty !
NIRV	Isaiah	2	11	Anyone who brags will be brought low . Anyone who is proud will be made humble . The Lord alone will be honored at that time .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	12	The Lord who rules over all has set apart a day when he will judge . He has set it apart for all those who are proud and think they are important . He has set it apart for all those who brag about themselves . All of them will be brought low .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	13	The Lord has set that day apart for all the cedar trees in Lebanon . They are very tall . He has set that day apart for all the oak trees in Bashan .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	14	He has set it apart for all the towering mountains . He has set it apart for all the high hills .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	15	He has set it apart for every high tower and every strong wall .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	16	He has set it apart for every trading ship and every beautiful boat .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	17	Anyone who brags will be brought low . Anyone who is proud will be made humble . The Lord alone will be honored at that time .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	18	And the statues of gods will totally disappear .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	19	People will run and hide in caves in the rocks . They will go into holes in the ground . They will run away from the terrifying presence of the Lord . They will run when he comes in glory and majesty . When he comes , he will shake the earth .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	20	People had made some statues of gods out of silver . They had made others out of gold . Then they worshiped them . But when the Lord comes , they will throw the statues away to the moles and bats .
NIRV	Isaiah	2	21	Those people will run and hide in caves in the rocks . They will go into holes in the cliffs . They will run away from the terrifying presence of the Lord . They will run when he comes in glory and majesty . When he comes , he will shake the earth .

NIRV	Isaiah	3	4	The Lord will make mere youths their leaders . Children will rule over them .
NIRV	Isaiah	3	5	People will treat one another badly . They will fight against one another . They will fight against their neighbors . Young people will attack old people . Ordinary people will attack those who are more important .
NIRV	Isaiah	3	6	A man will grab one of his brothers in his father ’ s house . He will say , “ You have a coat . So you be our leader . Take charge of all these broken-down buildings ! ”
NIRV	Isaiah	3	7	But at that time the brother will cry out , “ I can ’ t help you . I don ’ t have any food or clothing in my house . Don ’ t make me the leader of these people. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	3	8	Jerusalem is about to fall . And so is Judah . They say and do things against the Lord . They dare to disobey him to his very face .
NIRV	Isaiah	3	9	The look on their faces is a witness against them . They show off their sin , just as the people of Sodom did . They don ’ t even try to hide it . How terrible it will be for them ! They have brought trouble on themselves .
NIRV	Isaiah	3	10	Tell those who do what is right that things will go well with them . They will enjoy the results of the good things they ’ ve done .
NIRV	Isaiah	3	11	But how terrible it will be for those who do what is evil ! Trouble is about to fall on them . They will be paid back for the evil things they ’ ve done .
NIRV	Isaiah	3	12	Those who are young treat my people badly . Women rule over them . My people , your leaders have taken you down the wrong path . They have turned you away from the right path .
NIRV	Isaiah	3	13	The Lord takes his place in court . He stands up to judge the people .
NIRV	Isaiah	3	14	He judges the elders and leaders of his people . He says to them , “ My people are like a vineyard . You have destroyed them . The things you have taken from poor people are in your houses .
NIRV	Isaiah	3	15	What do you mean by crushing my people ? Why are you grinding the faces of the poor into the dirt ? ” announces the Lord . He is the Lord who rules over all .
NIRV	Isaiah	3	16	The Lord continues , “ The women in Zion are very proud . They walk along with their noses in the air . They tease men with their eyes . They sway their hips as they walk along . Little chains jingle on their ankles .
NIRV	Isaiah	3	17	So I will put sores on the heads of Zion ’ s women . And I will remove the hair from their heads. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	3	18	At that time the Lord will take away the beautiful things they wear . He will take away their decorations , headbands and moon-shaped necklaces .
NIRV	Isaiah	3	19	He ’ ll take away their earrings , bracelets and veils .
NIRV	Isaiah	3	20	He ’ ll remove their headdresses , anklets and belts . He ’ ll take away their perfume bottles and charms .

NIRV	Isaiah	3	25	Jerusalem , your men will be killed by swords . Your soldiers will die in battle .

NIRV	Isaiah	5	5	Now I will tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard . I will take away its fence . And the vineyard will be destroyed . I will break down its wall . And people will walk all over my vineyard .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	2	He dug up the soil and removed its stones . He planted the very best vines in it . He built a lookout tower there . He also cut out a winepress for it . Then he kept looking for a crop of good grapes . But the vineyard produced only bad fruit .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	3	So the Lord said , “ People of Jerusalem and Judah , you be the judge between me and my vineyard .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	4	What more could I have done for my vineyard ? I did everything I could . I kept looking for a crop of good grapes . So why did it produce only bad ones ?
NIRV	Isaiah	5	6	I will turn my vineyard into a dry and empty desert . It will not be pruned or taken care of . Thorns and bushes will grow there . I will command the clouds not to rain on it. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	5	7	The vineyard of the Lord who rules over all is the nation of Israel . The people of Judah are the vines he took delight in . He kept looking for them to do what is fair . But all he saw was blood being spilled . He kept looking for them to do what is right . But all he heard were cries of suffering . The Lord Judges His Vineyard
NIRV	Isaiah	5	8	How terrible it will be for you who get too many houses ! How terrible for you who get too many fields ! Finally there won ’ t be any space left in the land . Then you will live all alone .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	9	I heard the Lord who rules over all announce a message . He said , “ You can be sure that the great houses will become empty . The fine homes will be left with no one living in them .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	10	A ten-acre vineyard will produce only six gallons of wine .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	360	pounds of seeds will produce only
NIRV	Isaiah	5	36	pounds of grain. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	5	11	How terrible it will be for those who get up early in the morning to start drinking ! How terrible for those who stay up late at night until they are drunk with wine !
NIRV	Isaiah	5	12	They have harps and lyres at their banquets . They have tambourines , flutes and wine . But they don ’ t have any concern for the mighty acts of the Lord . They don ’ t have any respect for what his power has done .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	13	So my people will be taken away as prisoners . That ’ s because they don ’ t understand what the Lord has done . Their nobles will die of hunger . The rest of the people won ’ t have any water to drink .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	14	So Death opens its jaws to receive them . Its mouth is open wide to swallow them up . Their nobles and the rest of the people will go down into it . They will go there together with all those who have wild parties .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	15	So people will be brought low . Everyone will be made humble . Those who brag will be brought down .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	16	But the Lord who rules over all will be honored because he judges fairly . The holy God will prove that he is holy by doing what is right .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	17	Then sheep will graze as if they were in their own grasslands . Lambs will eat grass among the destroyed buildings where rich people used to live .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	18	How terrible it will be for those who continue to sin and lie about it ! How terrible for those who keep on doing what is evil as if they were tied to it !
NIRV	Isaiah	5	19	How terrible for those who say , “ Let God hurry up and do what he says he will . We want to see it happen . Let us see the plan of the Holy One of Israel . We want to know what it is. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	5	20	How terrible it will be for those who say that what is evil is good ! How terrible for those who say that what is good is evil ! How terrible for those who say that darkness is light and light is darkness ! How terrible for those who say that what is bitter is sweet and what is sweet is bitter !
NIRV	Isaiah	5	21	How terrible it will be for those who think they are wise ! How terrible for those who think they are really clever !
NIRV	Isaiah	5	22	How terrible it will be for those who are heroes at drinking wine ! How terrible for those who are heroes at mixing drinks !
NIRV	Isaiah	5	23	How terrible for those who take money to set guilty people free ! How terrible for those who don ’ t treat good people fairly !
NIRV	Isaiah	5	24	Flames of fire burn up straw . Dry grass sinks down into those flames . Evil people will be like plants whose roots rot away . They will be like flowers that are blown away like dust . That ’ s because they have said no to the law of the Lord who rules over all . They have turned against the message of the Holy One of Israel .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	25	So the Lord is angry with his people . He raises his hand against them and strikes them down . The mountains shake . The bodies of dead people lie in the streets like trash . Even then , the Lord is still angry . His hand is still raised against them .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	26	He lifts up a banner to gather the nations that are far away . He whistles for them to come from the farthest places on earth . Here they come . They are moving very quickly .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	27	None of them grows tired . None of them falls down . None of them sleeps or even takes a nap . All of them are ready for battle . Every belt is pulled tight . Not a single sandal strap is broken .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	28	The enemies ’ arrows are sharp . All their bows are ready . The hooves of their horses are as hard as rock . Their chariot wheels turn like a twister .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	29	The sound of their army is like the roar of lions . It ’ s like the roar of young lions . They growl as they capture what they were chasing . They carry it off . No one can take it away from them .
NIRV	Isaiah	5	30	At that time the enemy army will roar over Israel . It will sound like the roaring of the ocean . If someone looks at the land of Israel , there is only darkness and trouble . The clouds will make even the sun become dark . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	6	4	The sound of their voices caused the stone doorframe to shake . The temple was filled with smoke .
NIRV	Isaiah	6	5	“ How terrible it is for me ! ” I cried out . “ I ’ m about to be destroyed ! My mouth speaks sinful words . And I live among people who speak sinful words . Now I have seen the King with my own eyes . He is the Lord who rules over all. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	6	7	He touched my mouth with the coal . He said , “ This has touched your lips . Your guilt has been taken away . Your sin has been paid for. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	6	8	Then I heard the voice of the Lord . He said , “ Who will I send ? Who will go for us ? ” I said , “ Here I am . Send me ! ”
NIRV	Isaiah	6	9	So he said , “ Go and speak to these people . Tell them , “ ‘ You will hear but never understand . You will see but never know what you are seeing. ’
NIRV	Isaiah	6	10	Make the hearts of these people stubborn . Plug up their ears . Close their eyes . Otherwise they might see with their eyes . They might hear with their ears . They might understand with their hearts . And they might turn to me and be healed. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	6	11	Then I said , “ Lord , how long will it be like that ? ” He answered , “ It will last until the cities of Israel are destroyed . It will last until no one is living in them . It will last until the houses are deserted . The fields will be completely destroyed .
NIRV	Isaiah	6	12	It will last until the Lord has sent everyone far away . The land will be totally deserted .
NIRV	Isaiah	6	13	Suppose only a tenth of the people remain there . Even then the land will be completely destroyed again . But when oak trees and terebinth trees are cut down , stumps are left . And my holy people will be like stumps that begin to grow again. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	7	7	But I am the Lord and King . I say , “ ‘ “ That will not happen . It will not take place .
NIRV	Isaiah	7	2	The royal family of Ahaz was told , “ The army of Aram has joined forces with Ephraim ’ s army. ” So the hearts of Ahaz and his people trembled with fear . They shook just as trees in the forest shake when the wind blows through them .
NIRV	Isaiah	7	3	The Lord said to Isaiah , “ Go out and see Ahaz . Take your son Shear-Jashub with you . Meet Ahaz at the end of the channel that brings water from the Upper Pool . It is on the road to the Washerman ’ s Field .
NIRV	Isaiah	7	4	Tell Ahaz , ‘ Be careful . Stay calm . Do not be afraid . Do not lose hope because of the great anger of Rezin , Aram and the son of Remaliah . After all , they are nothing but two pieces of smoking firewood .
NIRV	Isaiah	7	5	Aram , Ephraim and Remaliah ’ s son have planned to destroy you . They said ,
NIRV	Isaiah	7	6	“ Let ’ s march into Judah and attack it . Let ’ s tear everything down . Then we can share the land among ourselves . And we can make Tabeel ’ s son king over it. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	7	8	The capital of Aram is Damascus . And the ruler of Damascus is only Rezin . Do not worry about the people of Ephraim . They will be too crushed to be considered a people . That will happen before
NIRV	Isaiah	7	65	years are over .
NIRV	Isaiah	7	9	The capital of Ephraim is Samaria . And the ruler of Samaria is only Remaliah ’ s son . If you do not stand firm in your faith , you will not stand at all. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	7	10	The Lord spoke to Ahaz through Isaiah again . He said ,
NIRV	Isaiah	7	11	“ I am the Lord your God . Ask me to give you a sign . It can be anything in the deepest grave or in the highest heaven. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	7	12	But Ahaz said , “ I won ’ t ask . I won ’ t test the Lord. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	7	13	Then Isaiah said , “ Listen , you members of the royal family of David ! Isn ’ t it enough for you to test the patience of human beings ? Are you also going to test the patience of my God ?
NIRV	Isaiah	7	14	The Lord himself will give you a sign . The virgin is going to have a baby . She will give birth to a son . And he will be called Immanuel .
NIRV	Isaiah	7	15	He will still be very young when he can decide between right and wrong .
NIRV	Isaiah	7	16	Even before then , the lands of the two kings you fear will be ruined .
NIRV	Isaiah	7	17	The Lord will also bring the king of Assyria against you . And he will bring him against your people and the whole royal family . That will be a time of trouble . It will be unlike any since the people of Ephraim broke away from Judah. ” The Lord Uses Assyria to Judge Judah
NIRV	Isaiah	7	18	At that time the Lord will whistle for the Egyptians . They will come like flies from the Nile River in Egypt . He will also whistle for the Assyrians . They will come from their country like bees .
NIRV	Isaiah	7	19	All of them will come and camp in the deep valleys . They will camp in caves in the rocks . And they ’ ll camp near bushes and water holes .
NIRV	Isaiah	7	20	At that time the Lord will use the Assyrians to punish you . Ahaz had hired them earlier from east of the Euphrates River . Now their king will be like a razor in the Lord ’ s hand . He will shave the hair from your head and private parts . He will also shave off your beards .
NIRV	Isaiah	7	21	At that time a person may only be able to keep alive one young cow and two goats .
NIRV	Isaiah	7	22	But they will give plenty of milk to live on . In fact , everyone left in the land will only have milk curds and honey to eat .
NIRV	Isaiah	7	23	The land used to have vineyards with 1,000 vines worth
NIRV	Isaiah	7	25	All the hills used to be plowed with hoes . But you won ’ t go there anymore . That ’ s because you will be afraid of the thorns and bushes . Cattle will be turned loose on those hills . Sheep will also run there . Copyright ©
NIRV	Isaiah	7	24	Hunters will go there with bows and arrows . That ’ s because it will be covered with bushes and thorns .

NIRV	Isaiah	8	8	They will sweep on into Judah like a flood . They will pass through Judah and reach all the way to Jerusalem . Immanuel , they will attack your land like an eagle . Their wings will spread out and cover it. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	8	2	So I sent for Zechariah and Uriah the priest . Zechariah is the son of Jeberekiah . Zechariah and Uriah were witnesses for me whom I could trust .
NIRV	Isaiah	8	3	Then I went and slept with my wife , who was a prophet . She became pregnant and had a baby boy . The Lord said to me , “ Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz .
NIRV	Isaiah	8	4	The king of Assyria will carry off the wealth of Damascus . He will also carry away the goods that were taken from Samaria . That will happen before the boy knows how to say ‘ My father ’ or ‘ My mother. ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	8	5	The Lord continued ,
NIRV	Isaiah	8	6	“ I am like the gently flowing stream of Siloam . But the people of Judah have turned their backs on me . They are filled with joy because of the fall of Rezin and the son of Remaliah .
NIRV	Isaiah	8	7	So I am about to bring against these people the king of Assyria and his whole army . The Assyrians will be like the mighty Euphrates River when it is flooding . They will run over everything in their path .
NIRV	Isaiah	8	9	Sound the battle cry , you nations ! But you will be torn apart . Listen , all you lands far away ! Prepare for battle ! But you will be torn apart . Prepare for battle ! But you will be torn apart .
NIRV	Isaiah	8	10	Make your battle plans ! But you won ’ t succeed . Give your orders ! But they won ’ t be carried out . That ’ s because God is with us .
NIRV	Isaiah	8	11	The Lord speaks to me while his powerful hand is on me . He is warning me not to live the way these people live . He says ,
NIRV	Isaiah	8	12	“ People of Judah , do not agree with those who say Isaiah is guilty of treason . Do not fear what they fear . Do not be afraid .
NIRV	Isaiah	8	13	The Lord rules over all . So you must think about him as holy . You must have respect for him . You must fear him .
NIRV	Isaiah	8	14	Then the Lord will be a holy place of safety for you . But that ’ s not true for many people in Israel and Judah . He will be a stone that causes them to trip . He will be a rock that makes them fall . And for the people of Jerusalem he will be a trap and a snare .
NIRV	Isaiah	8	15	Many of them will trip . They will fall and be broken . They will be trapped and captured. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	8	16	Tie up and seal this warning that the Lord said to you through me . Preserve among my followers what he taught you through me .
NIRV	Isaiah	8	17	I will wait for the Lord . He is turning his face away from Jacob ’ s people . I will put my trust in him .
NIRV	Isaiah	8	18	Here I am . Here are the children the Lord has given me . We are signs and reminders to Israel from the Lord who rules over all . He lives on Mount Zion . The Darkness Turns to Light
NIRV	Isaiah	8	19	There are people who get messages from those who have died . But these people only whisper words that are barely heard . Suppose someone tells you to ask for advice from these people . Shouldn ’ t you ask for advice from your God instead ? Why should you get advice from dead people to help those who are alive ?
NIRV	Isaiah	8	20	Follow what the Lord taught you and said to you through me . People who don ’ t speak in keeping with these words will have no hope in the morning .
NIRV	Isaiah	8	21	They will suffer and be hungry . They ’ ll wander through the land . When they are very hungry , they will become angry . They ’ ll look up toward heaven . They ’ ll ask for bad things to happen to their king and their God .
NIRV	Isaiah	8	22	Then they will look at the earth . They ’ ll see nothing but suffering and darkness . They ’ ll see terrible sadness . They ’ ll be driven into total darkness . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	9	9	All the people will know about it . Ephraim ’ s people and those who live in Samaria will know about it . Their hearts are very proud . They say ,
NIRV	Isaiah	9	2	The people who are now living in darkness will see a great light . They are now living in a very dark land . But a light will shine on them .
NIRV	Isaiah	9	3	Lord , you will make our nation larger . You will increase their joy . They will show you how glad they are . They will be as glad as people are at harvest time . They will be as glad as warriors are when they share the things they ’ ve taken after a battle .
NIRV	Isaiah	9	4	You set Israel free from Midian long ago . In the same way , you will break the heavy yoke that weighs Israel down . You will break the wooden beams that are on their shoulders . You will break the rods of those who strike them down .
NIRV	Isaiah	9	5	Every fighting man ’ s boot that he wore in battle will be burned up . So will every piece of clothing covered with blood . All of them will be thrown into the fire .
NIRV	Isaiah	9	6	A child will be born to us . A son will be given to us . He will rule over us . And he will be called Wonderful Adviser and Mighty God . He will also be called Father Who Lives Forever and Prince Who Brings Peace .

He will make the kingdom strong and secure . His rule will be based on what is fair and right . It will last forever . The Lord ’ s great love will make sure that happens . He rules over all . The Lord Is Angry With Israel
NIRV	Isaiah	9	8	The Lord has sent a message against Jacob ’ s people . He will punish Israel .
NIRV	Isaiah	9	10	“ The brick buildings have fallen down . But we will rebuild them with blocks of stone . The fig trees have been chopped down . But we ’ ll plant cedar trees in place of them. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	9	11	In spite of that , the Lord has made Rezin ’ s enemies stronger . He has stirred up Assyria to fight against Israel .
NIRV	Isaiah	9	12	Arameans from the east have opened their mouths and swallowed up Israel . So have Philistines from the west . Even then , the Lord is still angry . His hand is still raised against them .
NIRV	Isaiah	9	13	But his people have not returned to the God who struck them down . They haven ’ t turned for help to the Lord who rules over all .
NIRV	Isaiah	9	14	So he will cut off from Israel heads and tails alike . In a single day he will cut off palm branches and tall grass alike . The palm branches are the people who rule over others . The tall grass is the people who bow down to them .
NIRV	Isaiah	9	15	The elders and important leaders are the heads . The prophets who teach lies are the tails .
NIRV	Isaiah	9	16	Those who guide the people of Israel are leading them down the wrong path . So those who follow them aren ’ t on the right road .
NIRV	Isaiah	9	17	The Lord will not be pleased with the young men . He won ’ t take pity on widows and on children whose fathers have died . All of them are ungodly and evil . They say foolish things with their mouths . Even then , the Lord is still angry . His hand is still raised against them .
NIRV	Isaiah	9	18	What is evil burns like a fire . It burns up bushes and thorns . It sets the forest on fire . It sends up a huge column of smoke .
NIRV	Isaiah	9	19	The Lord rules over all . When he gets angry , he will burn up the land . The people will burn in the fire . They will not spare one another .
NIRV	Isaiah	9	20	People will eat up everything they can find on their right . But they ’ ll still be hungry . They will eat everything they can find on their left . But they won ’ t be satisfied . So they will eat the dead bodies of their children .
NIRV	Isaiah	9	21	That ’ s what Manasseh ’ s people will do to Ephraim . And that ’ s what Ephraim ’ s people will do to Manasseh . Together they will turn against Judah . Even then , the Lord is still angry . His hand is still raised against them . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	10	10	My powerful hand grabbed hold of kingdoms whose people worship statues of gods . They had more gods than Jerusalem and Samaria did .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	2	You take away the rights of poor people . You hold back what is fair from my people who are suffering . You take for yourselves what belongs to widows . You rob children whose fathers have died .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	3	What will you do on the day when the Lord punishes you ? On that day trouble will come from far away . Who will you run to for help ? Who will you trust your riches with ?
NIRV	Isaiah	10	4	All you can do is bow down in fear among the prisoners . All you can do is fall among those who have died in battle . Even then , the Lord is still angry . His hand is still raised against them . The Lord Will Judge Assyria
NIRV	Isaiah	10	5	The Lord says , “ How terrible it will be for the people of Assyria ! They are the war club that carries out my anger .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	6	I will send them against the ungodly nation of Judah . I will order them to fight against my own people . My people make me angry . I will order Assyria to take their goods and carry them away . I will order Assyria to walk on my people as if they were walking on mud .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	7	But that is not what the king of Assyria plans . It is not what he has in mind . His purpose is to destroy many nations . His purpose is to put an end to them .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	8	‘ Aren ’ t all my commanders kings ? ’ he says .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	9	‘ I took over Kalno just as I took Carchemish . I took over Hamath just as I did Arpad . I took Samaria just as I did Damascus .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	11	I took over Samaria and its statues of gods . In the same way , I will take Jerusalem and its gods. ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	10	12	The Lord will finish everything he has planned to do against Mount Zion and Jerusalem . Then he ’ ll say , “ Now I will punish the king of Assyria . I will punish him because his heart and his eyes are so proud .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	13	The king of Assyria says , “ ‘ By my power I have taken over all these nations . I am very wise . I have great understanding . I have wiped out the borders between nations . I ’ ve taken their treasures . Like a great hero I ’ ve brought their kings under my control .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	14	I ’ ve taken the wealth of the nations . It was as easy as reaching into a bird ’ s nest . I ’ ve gathered the riches of all these countries . It was as easy as gathering eggs that have been left in a nest . Not a single baby bird flapped its wings . Not one of them opened its mouth to chirp. ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	10	15	Does an ax claim to be more important than the person who swings it ? Does a saw brag that it is better than the one who uses it ? That would be like a stick swinging the person who picks it up ! It would be like a war club waving the one who carries it !
NIRV	Isaiah	10	16	So the Lord who rules over all will send a sickness . The Lord will send it on the king of Assyria ’ s strong fighting men . It will make them weaker and weaker . The army he was so proud of will be completely destroyed . It will be as if it had been burned up in a fire .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	17	The Lord is the Light of Israel . He will become a fire . Israel ’ s Holy One will become a flame . In a single day he will burn up all Assyria ’ s bushes . He will destroy all their thorns .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	18	He will completely destroy the beauty of their forests and rich farm lands . The Assyrian army will be like a sick person who becomes weaker and weaker .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	19	It will be like the trees of their forests . So few of them will be left standing that even a child could count them . The Israelites Who Are Left Alive
NIRV	Isaiah	10	20	In days to come , some people will still be left alive in Israel . They will be from Jacob ’ s family line . But they won ’ t depend any longer on the nation that struck them down . Instead , they will truly depend on the Lord . He is the Holy One of Israel .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	21	The people of Jacob who are still alive will return to the Mighty God .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	22	Israel , your people might be as many as the grains of sand by the sea . But only a few of them will return . The Lord has handed down a death sentence . He will destroy his people . What he does is right .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	23	The Lord who rules over all will carry out his sentence . The Lord will destroy the whole land .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	24	The Lord rules over all . The Lord says , “ My people who live in Zion , do not be afraid of the Assyrian army . They beat you with rods . They lift up war clubs against you , just as the Egyptians did .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	25	Very soon I will not be angry with you anymore . I will turn my anger against the Assyrians . I will destroy them. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	10	26	The Lord who rules over all will beat them with a whip . He will strike them down as he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb . And he will stretch out his walking stick over the waters . That ’ s what he did in Egypt .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	27	People of Zion , in days to come he will help you . He will lift the heavy load of the Assyrians from your shoulders . He will remove their yokes from your necks . Their yokes will be broken because you have become so strong .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	28	The Assyrian army has entered the town of Aiath . They have passed through Migron . They have stored up supplies at Mikmash .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	29	They have marched through the pass there . They said , “ Let ’ s camp for the night at Geba. ” The people of Ramah tremble with fear . Those who live in Gibeah of Saul run away .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	30	Town of Gallim , cry out ! Laishah , listen ! Poor Anathoth !
NIRV	Isaiah	10	31	The people of Madmenah are running away . Those who live in Gebim are hiding .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	32	Today the Assyrians have stopped at Nob . They are shaking their fists at Mount Zion in the city of Jerusalem .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	33	The Assyrian soldiers are like trees in a forest . The Lord who rules over all will chop them down . The Lord will cut off their branches with his great power . He will chop the tall trees down . He will cut down even the highest ones .
NIRV	Isaiah	10	34	The Mighty One will chop down the forest with his ax . He will cut down the cedar trees in Lebanon . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	11	11	At that time the Lord will reach out his hand . He will gather his people a second time . He will bring back those who are left alive . He ’ ll bring them back from Assyria , Lower Egypt , Upper Egypt and Cush . He ’ ll bring them from Elam , Babylon and Hamath . He will also bring them from the islands of the Mediterranean Sea .
NIRV	Isaiah	11	2	The Spirit of the Lord will rest on that Branch . The Spirit will help him to be wise and understanding . The Spirit will help him make wise plans and carry them out . The Spirit will help him know the Lord and have respect for him .
NIRV	Isaiah	11	3	The Branch will take delight in respecting the Lord . He will not judge things only by the way they look . He won ’ t make decisions based simply on what people say .
NIRV	Isaiah	11	4	He will always do what is right when he judges those who are in need . He ’ ll be completely fair when he makes decisions about poor people . When he commands that people be punished , it will happen . When he orders that evil people be put to death , it will take place .
NIRV	Isaiah	11	5	He will put on godliness as if it were his belt . He ’ ll wear faithfulness around his waist .
NIRV	Isaiah	11	6	Wolves will live with lambs . Leopards will lie down with goats . Calves and lions will eat together . And little children will lead them around .
NIRV	Isaiah	11	7	Cows will eat with bears . Their little ones will lie down together . And lions will eat straw like oxen .
NIRV	Isaiah	11	8	A baby will play near a hole where cobras live . A young child will put its hand into a nest where poisonous snakes live .
NIRV	Isaiah	11	9	None of those animals will harm or destroy anything or anyone on my holy mountain of Zion . The oceans are full of water . In the same way , the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord .
NIRV	Isaiah	11	10	At that time , here is what the man who is called the Root of Jesse will do . He will be like a banner that brings nations together . They will come to him . And the place where he rules will be glorious .
NIRV	Isaiah	11	12	He will lift up a banner . It will show the nations that he is gathering the people of Israel . He ’ ll bring back those who had been taken away as prisoners . He ’ ll gather together the scattered people of Judah . He ’ ll bring them back from all four directions .
NIRV	Isaiah	11	13	Ephraim ’ s people won ’ t be jealous anymore . Judah ’ s attackers will be destroyed . Ephraim won ’ t be jealous of Judah . And Judah won ’ t attack Ephraim .
NIRV	Isaiah	11	14	Together they will rush down the slopes of Philistia to the west . They ’ ll take what belongs to the people of the east . They ’ ll take over Edom and Moab . The people of Ammon will be under their control .
NIRV	Isaiah	11	15	The Lord will dry up the Red Sea in Egypt . By his power he ’ ll send a burning wind to sweep over the Euphrates River . He will break it up into many streams . Then people will be able to go across it wearing sandals .
NIRV	Isaiah	11	16	There was a road the people of Israel used when they came up from Egypt . In the same way , there will be a wide road coming out of Assyria . It will be used by the Lord ’ s people who are left alive there . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	13	11	The Lord will punish the world because it is so evil . He will punish evil people for their sins . He ’ ll put an end to the bragging of those who are proud . He ’ ll bring down the pride of those who don ’ t show any pity .

NIRV	Isaiah	14	14	I will rise above the tops of the clouds . I ’ ll make myself like the Most High God. ’
NIRV	Isaiah	14	2	Nations will help Israel return to their own land . Israel will possess other nations . They will serve Israel as male and female servants in the Lord ’ s land . The Israelites will make prisoners of those who had held them as prisoners . Israel will rule over those who had crushed them .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	3	The Lord will put an end to Israel ’ s suffering and trouble . They will no longer be forced to do hard labor . At that time ,
NIRV	Isaiah	14	4	they will make fun of the king of Babylon . They will say , “ See how the one who crushed others has fallen ! See how his anger has come to an end !
NIRV	Isaiah	14	5	The Lord has taken away the authority of evil people . He has broken the power of rulers .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	6	When they became angry , they struck down nations . Their blows never stopped . In their anger they brought nations under their control . They attacked them again and again .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	7	All the lands now enjoy peace and rest . They break out into singing .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	8	Even the juniper trees show how happy they are . The cedar trees of Lebanon celebrate too . They say , ‘ Babylon , you have fallen . Now no one comes and cuts us down. ’
NIRV	Isaiah	14	9	“ King of Babylon , many people in the place of the dead are really excited . They ’ re excited about meeting you when you go down there . The spirits of the dead get up to welcome you . At one time all of them were leaders in the world . They were kings over the nations . They get up from their thrones .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	10	All of them call out to you . They say , ‘ You have become weak , just as we are . You have become like us. ’
NIRV	Isaiah	14	11	Your grand show of power has been brought down to the grave . The noise of your harps has come down here along with your power . Maggots are spread out under you . Worms cover you .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	12	“ King of Babylon , you thought you were the bright morning star . But now you have fallen from heaven ! You once brought down nations . But now you have been thrown down to the earth !
NIRV	Isaiah	14	13	You said in your heart , ‘ I will go up to the heavens . I ’ ll raise my throne above the stars of God . I ’ ll sit as king on the mountain where the gods meet . I ’ ll set up my throne on the highest slopes of Mount Zaphon .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	15	But now you have been brought down to the place of the dead . You have been thrown into the deepest part of the pit .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	16	“ Those who see you stare at you . They think about what has happened to you . They say to themselves , ‘ Is this the man who shook the earth ? Is he the one who made kingdoms tremble with fear ?
NIRV	Isaiah	14	17	Did he turn the world into a desert ? Did he destroy its cities ? Did he refuse to let his prisoners go home ? ’
NIRV	Isaiah	14	18	“ All the kings of the nations are buried with honor . Each of them lies in his own tomb .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	19	But you have been thrown out of your tomb . You are like a branch that is cut off and thrown away . You are covered with the bodies of those who have been killed by swords . You have been tossed into a stony pit along with them . You are like a dead body that people have walked on .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	20	You won ’ t be buried like other kings . That ’ s because you have destroyed your land . You have killed your people . “ Let the children of that evil man be killed . Let none of them be left to carry on the family name .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	21	So prepare a place to kill his children . Kill them because of the sins of the rulers who lived before them . They must not rise to power . They must not rule over the world . They must not cover the earth with their cities. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	14	22	“ I will rise up against them , ” announces the Lord who rules over all . “ I will destroy Babylon . It will not be remembered anymore . No one will be left alive there . I will destroy its people and their children after them , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	23	“ I will turn it into a place where nothing but owls can live . I will turn it into a swamp . I will sweep through it like a broom and destroy everything , ” announces the Lord who rules over all .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	24	The Lord who rules over all has made a promise . He has said , “ You can be sure that what I have planned will happen . What I have decided will take place .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	25	I will crush the Assyrians in my land . On my mountains I will walk all over them . The yokes they put on my people will be removed . The heavy load they put on their shoulders will be taken away. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	14	26	That ’ s how the Lord carries out his plan all over the world . That ’ s how he reaches out his powerful hand to punish all the nations .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	27	The Lord who rules over all has planned it . Who can stop him ? He has reached out his powerful hand . Who can keep him from using it ? A Prophecy Against the Philistines
NIRV	Isaiah	14	28	This prophecy came to me from the Lord in the year King Ahaz died . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Isaiah	14	29	“ The rod of Assyria has struck all of you Philistines . But do not be glad that it is broken . That rod is like a snake that will produce an even more poisonous snake . It will produce a darting , poisonous serpent .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	30	Even the poorest people in Israel will have plenty to eat . Those who are in need will lie down in safety . But I will destroy your families . They will die of hunger . I will kill any of them who are still left alive .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	31	“ Cities of Philistia , cry out for help ! Scream in pain ! All you Philistines , melt away in fear ! An army is coming from the north in a cloud of dust . No one in its ranks is falling behind .
NIRV	Isaiah	14	32	What answer should be given to the messengers from that nation ? Tell them , ‘ The Lord has made Zion secure . His suffering people will find safety there. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	15	15	Here is a prophecy against Moab that the Lord gave me . The city of Ar in Moab is destroyed . It happened in a single night . Kir in Moab is also destroyed . It happened in a single night .
NIRV	Isaiah	15	2	The people of Dibon go up to their temple to worship . They go to their high places to weep . The people of Moab cry over the cities of Nebo and Medeba . All their heads are shaved . All their beards have been cut off .
NIRV	Isaiah	15	3	In the streets they wear the rough clothing people wear when they ’ re sad . On their roofs and in the market places all of them are crying . They fall down flat with their faces toward the ground . And they weep .
NIRV	Isaiah	15	4	The people of Heshbon and Elealeh cry out . Their voices are heard all the way to Jahaz . So the fighting men of Moab cry out . Their hearts are weak .
NIRV	Isaiah	15	5	My heart cries out over Moab . Some who run away get as far as Zoar . Others run all the way to Eglath Shelishiyah . Others go up the hill to Luhith . They are weeping as they go . Still others travel the road to Horonaim . They sing a song of sadness because their town is being destroyed .
NIRV	Isaiah	15	6	The waters at Nimrim are dried up . And so is the grass . The plants have died . Nothing green is left .
NIRV	Isaiah	15	7	The people are trying to escape through the Valley of the Poplar Trees . They are carrying with them the wealth they have collected and stored up .
NIRV	Isaiah	15	8	Their loud cries echo along the border of Moab . They reach as far as Eglaim . Their songs of sadness reach all the way to Beer Elim .
NIRV	Isaiah	15	9	The waters of the city of Dimon are full of blood . But the Lord will bring even more trouble on Dimon . He will bring lions against those who run away from Moab . They will also attack those who remain in the land . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	16	16	People of Moab , send lambs as a gift to the ruler of Judah . Send them from Sela . Send them across the desert . Send them to Mount Zion in the city of Jerusalem .
NIRV	Isaiah	16	2	The women of Moab are at the places where people go across the Arnon River . They are like birds that flap their wings when they are pushed from their nest .
NIRV	Isaiah	16	3	The Moabites say to the rulers of Judah , “ Make up your mind . Make a decision . Cover us with your shadow . Make it like night even at noon . Hide those of us who are running away . Don ’ t turn them over to their enemies .
NIRV	Isaiah	16	4	Let those who have run away from Moab stay with you . Keep them safe from those who are trying to destroy them. ” Those who crush others will be destroyed . The killing will stop . The attackers will disappear from the earth .
NIRV	Isaiah	16	5	A man from the royal house of David will sit on Judah ’ s throne . He will rule with faithful love . When he judges he will do what is fair . He will be quick to do what is right .
NIRV	Isaiah	16	6	We have heard all about Moab ’ s pride . We have heard how very proud they are . They think they are so much better than others . They brag about themselves . But all their bragging is nothing but empty words .
NIRV	Isaiah	16	7	So the people of Moab cry out . All of them cry over their country . Sing a song of sadness . Weep that you can no longer enjoy the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth .
NIRV	Isaiah	16	8	The fields of Heshbon dry up . So do the vines of Sibmah . The rulers of the nations have walked all over its finest vines . Those vines once reached as far as Jazer . They spread out toward the desert . Their new growth went all the way to the Dead Sea .
NIRV	Isaiah	16	9	Jazer weeps for the vines of Sibmah . And so do I. Heshbon and Elealeh , I soak you with my tears ! There isn ’ t any ripe fruit for people to shout about . There isn ’ t any harvest to make them happy .
NIRV	Isaiah	16	10	Joy and gladness are taken away from the orchards . No one sings or shouts in the vineyards . No one stomps on grapes at the winepresses . That ’ s because the Lord has put an end to the shouting .
NIRV	Isaiah	16	11	My heart mourns over Moab like a song of sadness played on a harp . Deep down inside me I mourn over Kir Hareseth .
NIRV	Isaiah	16	12	Moab ’ s people go to their high place to pray . But all they do is wear themselves out . Their god Chemosh can ’ t help them at all .
NIRV	Isaiah	16	13	That ’ s the message the Lord has already spoken against Moab .
NIRV	Isaiah	16	14	But now he says , “ In exactly three years , people will look down on Moab ’ s glory . Now Moab has many people . But by that time only a few of them will be left alive . And even they will be weak. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	17	17	Here is a prophecy against Damascus that the Lord gave me . He said , “ Damascus will not be a city anymore . Instead , all its buildings will be knocked down .
NIRV	Isaiah	17	2	The cities of Aroer will be deserted . They will be left to the flocks that lie down there . No one will make them afraid .
NIRV	Isaiah	17	3	Ephraim ’ s people will no longer have cities with high walls around them . Royal power will disappear from Damascus . Those who are left alive in Aram will be like the glory of the people of Israel , ” announces the Lord who rules over all .
NIRV	Isaiah	17	4	“ In days to come , the glory of Jacob ’ s people will fade . Their strength will get weaker and weaker .
NIRV	Isaiah	17	5	It will be as when workers cut and gather grain in the Valley of Rephaim . They gather up stalks in their arms . Only a few heads of grain are left .
NIRV	Isaiah	17	6	In the same way , only a few people will be left alive . It will be as when workers knock olives off the trees . Only two or three olives are left on the highest branches . Four or five at most are left on the limbs that produce fruit , ” announces the Lord , the God of Israel .
NIRV	Isaiah	17	7	In days to come , people will look to their Maker for help . They will turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel .
NIRV	Isaiah	17	8	They won ’ t trust in the altars they made with their own hands . They won ’ t pay any attention to the poles they used to worship the female god named Asherah . And they won ’ t depend on the incense altars they made with their own fingers .
NIRV	Isaiah	17	9	At that time the strong cities in Israel will be deserted . They will be as they were when the Israelites drove the Canaanites away . They will be like places that are taken over by bushes and weeds . The whole land will become dry and empty .
NIRV	Isaiah	17	10	Israel , you have forgotten God , who saves you . You have not remembered the Rock , who keeps you safe . You might set out the finest plants . You might plant vines from other lands .
NIRV	Isaiah	17	11	The plants might start to grow on the day you set them out . The vines might begin to bud on the morning you plant them . But even if they do , there won ’ t be any harvest . Instead , there will be sickness and pain that won ’ t go away .
NIRV	Isaiah	17	12	How terrible it will be for the nations that attack us ! The noise of their armies is like the sound of the ocean . How terrible it will be for the nations who fight against us ! They are as loud as huge waves crashing on the shore .
NIRV	Isaiah	17	13	They sound like the roar of rushing waters . But when the Lord speaks out against them , they run far away . The wind blows them away like straw on the hills . A strong wind drives them along like tumbleweeds .
NIRV	Isaiah	17	14	In the evening , the nations terrify us . But before morning comes , they are gone . That ’ s what happens to those who steal our goods . That ’ s what happens to those who take what belongs to us . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	18	18	How terrible it will be for the land whose armies are like large numbers of flying insects ! That land is along the rivers of Cush .
NIRV	Isaiah	18	2	Its people send messengers on the Nile River . They travel over the water in papyrus boats . Messengers , hurry back home ! Go back to your people , who are tall and have smooth skin . Everyone is afraid of them . They are warriors whose language is different from ours . Their land is divided up by rivers .
NIRV	Isaiah	18	3	Pay attention , all you people of the world ! Listen , all you who live on earth ! Banners will be lifted up on the mountains . And you will see them . Trumpets will be blown . And you will hear them .
NIRV	Isaiah	18	4	The Lord says to me , “ I will look down from heaven , where I live . I will be as quiet as summer heat in the sunshine . I will be as quiet as a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	18	5	A farmer cuts off new growth with pruning knives . He cuts down spreading branches and takes them away . He does it before the grapes are harvested . That ’ s when the blooms are gone and the grapes are ripe . In the same way , the Lord will cut off the nations that are gathered against his people .
NIRV	Isaiah	18	6	Their dead bodies will be left for the birds of the mountains to eat . They will be left for the wild animals . The birds will eat the dead bodies all summer long . The wild animals will eat them all through the winter .
NIRV	Isaiah	18	7	At that time gifts will be brought to the Lord who rules over all . The people who are tall and have smooth skin will bring them . Everyone is afraid of those people . They are warriors whose language is different from ours . Their land is divided up by rivers . They will bring their gifts to Mount Zion . That ’ s where the Lord who rules over all has put his Name . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	19	19	At that time there will be an altar to the Lord in the middle of Egypt . There will be a monument to him at its border .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	2	The Lord says , “ I will stir up one Egyptian against another . Relatives will fight against relatives . Neighbors will fight against one another . Cities will fight against cities . Kingdoms will fight against one another .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	3	The people of Egypt will lose hope . I will keep them from doing what they plan to do . They will ask their gods for advice . They will turn to the spirits of dead people for help . They will go to people who get messages from those who have died . They will ask for advice from people who talk to the spirits of the dead .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	4	I will hand the Egyptians over to a mean and unkind master . A powerful king will rule over them , ” announces the Lord . He is the Lord who rules over all .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	5	The waters of the Nile River will dry up . The bottom of it will be cracked and dry .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	6	Its canals will stink . And the streams of Egypt will get smaller and smaller until they dry up . The tall grass that grows along the river will dry up .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	7	So will the plants along the banks of the Nile . Even the planted fields along the Nile will dry up . Everything that grows there will blow away and disappear .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	8	The fishermen will moan . All those who drop hooks into the Nile will weep . Those who throw their nets on the water will become very sad .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	9	Those who make clothes out of flax will lose hope . So will those who weave fine linen .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	10	Those who work with cloth will be unhappy . And all those who work for money will be sick at heart .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	11	The officials of the city of Zoan are very foolish . Pharaoh ’ s wise men give advice that doesn ’ t make any sense . How can they dare to say to Pharaoh , “ We ’ re among the wise men ” ? How can they say to him , “ We ’ re like the advisers to the kings of long ago ” ?
NIRV	Isaiah	19	12	Pharaoh , where are your wise men now ? Let them tell you what the Lord who rules over all has planned against Egypt .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	13	The officials of Zoan have become foolish . The leaders of Memphis have been lied to . The most important leaders in Egypt have led its people astray .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	14	The Lord has given them a spirit that makes them feel dizzy . They make Egypt unsteady in everything it does . Egypt is like a person who drinks too much . He throws up and then walks around in the mess he ’ s made .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	15	No one in Egypt can do anything to help them . Its elders and important leaders can ’ t help them . Its prophets and priests can ’ t do anything . Those who rule over others can ’ t help . And those who bow down to them can ’ t help either .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	16	In days to come , the people of Egypt will become weak . The Lord who rules over all will raise his hand against them . Then they will tremble with fear .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	17	The people of Judah will bring terror to the Egyptians . Everyone in Egypt who hears the name of Judah will be terrified . That ’ s because of what the Lord who rules over all is planning to do to them .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	18	At that time the people of five cities in Egypt will worship the Lord . He is the Lord who rules over all . They will use the Hebrew language when they worship him . They will promise to be faithful to him . One of those cities will be called the City of the Sun .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	20	They will remind people that the Lord who rules over all is worshiped in Egypt . The people there will cry out to the Lord . They will cry out because of those who treat them badly . He will send someone to stand up for them and save them . And he will set them free .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	21	So the Lord will make himself known to the people of Egypt . At that time they will recognize that he is the Lord . They will worship him by bringing sacrifices and grain offerings to him . They will make promises to the Lord . And they will keep them .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	22	The Lord will strike Egypt with a plague . But then he will heal them . They will turn to the Lord . And he will answer their prayers and heal them .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	23	At that time there will be a wide road from Egypt to Assyria . The people of Assyria will go to Egypt . And the people of Egypt will go to Assyria . The people of Egypt and Assyria will worship the Lord together .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	24	At that time Egypt , Assyria and Israel will be a blessing to the whole earth .
NIRV	Isaiah	19	25	The Lord who rules over all will bless those three nations . He will say , “ Let the Egyptians be blessed . They are my people . Let the Assyrians be blessed . My hands created them . And let the Israelites be blessed . They are my very own people. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	20	20	Sargon , the king of Assyria , sent his highest commander to the city of Ashdod . He attacked it and captured it .
NIRV	Isaiah	20	2	Three years earlier the Lord had spoken to Isaiah , the son of Amoz . The Lord had said , “ Take off the rough clothing you are wearing . And take off your sandals. ” So Isaiah did . He went around barefoot and naked .
NIRV	Isaiah	20	3	After Ashdod was captured , the Lord said , “ My servant Isaiah has gone around barefoot and naked for three years . He is a sign and reminder to Egypt and Cush about what will happen to them .
NIRV	Isaiah	20	4	The king of Assyria will lead prisoners away from Egypt and Cush . Young people and old people alike will be taken away . Like Isaiah , they will be barefoot and naked . Their backsides will be bare . So the Egyptians will be put to shame .
NIRV	Isaiah	20	5	People trusted in Cush to help them . They bragged about what Egypt could do for them . But they will lose heart and be put to shame .
NIRV	Isaiah	20	6	At that time the people who live on the coast of Philistia will speak up . They will say , ‘ See what has happened to those we depended on ! We ran to them for help . We wanted them to save us from the king of Assyria . Now how can we escape ? ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	21	21	Here is a prophecy against Babylon that the Lord gave me . Babylon is known as the Desert by the Sea . An attack is coming through the desert . It is coming from a land of terror . It ’ s sweeping along like a windstorm blowing across the Negev Desert .
NIRV	Isaiah	21	2	I have seen a vision about something terrible that will happen . People are turning against Babylon . Robbers are taking its goods . Elamites , attack the city ! Medes , surround it ! The Lord will put an end to all the suffering Babylon has caused .
NIRV	Isaiah	21	3	The vision fills my body with pain . Pains take hold of me . They are like the pains of a woman having a baby . I am shaken by what I hear . I ’ m terrified by what I see .
NIRV	Isaiah	21	4	My heart grows weak . Fear makes me tremble . I longed for evening to come . But it brought me horror instead of rest .
NIRV	Isaiah	21	5	In my vision the Babylonians set the tables . They spread out the rugs . They eat and drink . Get up , you officers ! Rub your shields with oil !
NIRV	Isaiah	21	6	The Lord said to me , “ Go . Put a guard on duty on Jerusalem ’ s walls . Have him report what he sees .
NIRV	Isaiah	21	7	Tell him to watch for chariots that are pulled by teams of horses . Tell him to watch for men riding on donkeys or camels . Make sure he stays awake . Make sure he stays wide awake. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	21	8	“ My master ! ” the guard shouts back . “ Day after day I stand here on the lookout tower . Every night I stay here on duty .
NIRV	Isaiah	21	9	Look ! Here comes a man in a chariot ! It ’ s being pulled by a team of horses . He ’ s calling out the news , ‘ Babylon has fallen ! It has fallen ! All the statues of its gods lie broken in pieces on the ground ! ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	21	10	My people , you have been crushed like grain on a threshing floor . But now I ’ m telling you the good news I ’ ve heard . It comes from the Lord who rules over all . He is the God of Israel . A Prophecy Against Edom
NIRV	Isaiah	21	11	Here is a prophecy against Edom that the Lord gave me . Someone is calling out to me from the land of Seir . He says , “ Guard , when will the night be over ? Guard , how soon will it end ? ”
NIRV	Isaiah	21	12	The guard answers , “ Morning is coming , but the night will return . If you want to ask again , come back and ask. ” A Prophecy Against Arabia
NIRV	Isaiah	21	13	Here is a prophecy against Arabia that the Lord gave me . He told me to give orders to traders from Dedan . They were camping in the bushes of Arabia .
NIRV	Isaiah	21	14	I told them to bring water for those who are thirsty . I also gave orders to those who live in Tema . I told them to bring food for those who are running away .
NIRV	Isaiah	21	15	They are running away from where the fighting is heaviest . That ’ s where the swords are ready to strike . That ’ s where the bows are ready to shoot .
NIRV	Isaiah	21	16	The Lord spoke to me . He said , “ In exactly one year , Kedar ’ s splendor will come to an end .
NIRV	Isaiah	21	17	Only a few of Kedar ’ s soldiers who shoot arrows will be left alive. ” The Lord has spoken . He is the God of Israel . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	22	22	The Lord will give Eliakim the key of authority in David ’ s royal house . No one can shut what he opens . And no one can open what he shuts .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	2	Why is your town so full of noise ? Why is your city so full of the sound of wild parties ? Those among you who died weren ’ t killed by swords . They didn ’ t die in battle .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	3	All your leaders have run away . They ’ ve been captured without a single arrow being shot . All you who were caught were taken away as prisoners . You ran off while your enemies were still far away .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	4	So I said , “ Leave me alone . Let me weep bitter tears . Don ’ t try to comfort me . My people have been destroyed. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	22	5	The Lord who rules over all sent the noise of battle against you . The Lord brought disorder and terror to the Valley of Vision . The walls of the city were knocked down . Cries for help were heard in the mountains .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	6	Soldiers from Elam came armed with bows and arrows . They came with their chariots and horses . Soldiers from Kir got their shields ready .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	7	Your rich valleys filled up with chariots . Horsemen took up their battle positions at your city gates .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	8	The Lord made Judah a place where it wasn ’ t safe to live anymore . At that time , you depended on the weapons in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	9	You saw that the walls of the City of David were broken through in many places . You stored up water in the Lower Pool .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	10	You picked out the weaker buildings in Jerusalem . You tore them down and used their stones to strengthen the city walls against attack .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	11	You built a pool between the two walls . You used it to save the water that was running down from the Old Pool . But you didn ’ t look to the God who made it all possible . You didn ’ t pay any attention to the God who planned everything long ago .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	12	The Lord who rules over all called out to you at that time . The Lord told you to weep and cry . He told you to tear your hair out . And he told you to put on the rough clothing people wear when they ’ re sad .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	13	Instead , you are enjoying yourselves at wild parties ! You are killing cattle and sheep . You are eating their meat and drinking wine . You are saying , “ Let ’ s eat and drink , because tomorrow we ’ ll die. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	22	14	I heard the Lord who rules over all speaking . “ Your sin can never be paid for as long as you live , ” says the Lord .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	15	The Lord who rules over all speaks . The Lord says , “ Go and speak to Shebna , the head servant . He is in charge of the palace . Tell him ,
NIRV	Isaiah	22	16	‘ What are you doing here outside the city ? Who allowed you to cut out a tomb for yourself here ? Who said you could carve out your grave on the hillside ? Who allowed you to cut out your resting place in the rock ?
NIRV	Isaiah	22	17	“ ‘ Watch out , you mighty man ! The Lord is about to grab you . He is about to throw you away .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	18	He will roll you up tightly like a ball . He will throw you into a very large country . There you will die . And that ’ s where the chariots you were so proud of will be . Those chariots will then bring nothing but shame on your master ’ s family !
NIRV	Isaiah	22	19	The Lord will remove you from your job . You will be brought down from your high position .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	20	“ ‘ At that time he will send for his servant Eliakim . He is the son of Hilkiah .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	21	The Lord will put your robe on Eliakim . He will tie your belt around him . He will hand your authority over to him . Eliakim will be like a father to the people of Jerusalem and Judah .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	23	The Lord will set him firmly in place like a peg driven into a wall . He will hold a position of honor in his family .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	24	The good name of his whole family will depend on him . They will be like bowls and jars hanging on a peg .
NIRV	Isaiah	22	25	“ ‘ But a new day is coming , ’ ” announces the Lord who rules over all . “ ‘ At that time the peg that was driven into the wall will give way . It will break off and fall down . And the heavy load hanging on it will also fall. ’ ” The Lord has spoken . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	23	23	Here is a prophecy against Tyre that the Lord gave me . Men in the ships of Tarshish , cry out ! The city of Tyre is destroyed . Its houses and harbor are gone . That ’ s the message you have received from the island of Cyprus .
NIRV	Isaiah	23	2	People on the island of Tyre , be silent . Traders from the city of Sidon , be quiet . Those who sail on the Mediterranean Sea have made you rich .
NIRV	Isaiah	23	3	Grain from Egypt came across the mighty waters . The harvest of the Nile River brought wealth to Tyre . It became the market place of the nations .
NIRV	Isaiah	23	4	Sidon , be ashamed . Mighty Tyre out in the sea , be ashamed . The sea has spoken . It has said , “ It ’ s as if I had never felt labor pains or had children . It ’ s as if I had never brought up sons or daughters . It ’ s as if the city of Tyre had never existed. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	23	5	The Egyptians will hear about what has happened to Tyre . They ’ ll be very sad and troubled .
NIRV	Isaiah	23	6	People of the island of Tyre , cry out ! Go across the sea to Tarshish .
NIRV	Isaiah	23	7	Just look at Tyre . It ’ s no longer the old , old city that was known for its wild parties . It no longer sends its people out to make their homes in lands far away .
NIRV	Isaiah	23	8	Tyre was a city that produced kings . Its traders were princes . They were honored all over the earth . So who planned to destroy such a city ?
NIRV	Isaiah	23	9	The Lord who rules over all planned to do it . He wanted to bring down all its pride and glory . He wanted to shame those who were honored all over the earth .
NIRV	Isaiah	23	10	People of Tarshish , farm your land as they do along the Nile River . That ’ s because you don ’ t have a harbor anymore .
NIRV	Isaiah	23	11	The Lord has reached his powerful hand out over the sea . He has made its kingdoms tremble with fear . He has given a command concerning Phoenicia . He has ordered that its forts be destroyed .
NIRV	Isaiah	23	12	He said , “ No more wild parties for you ! People of Sidon , you are now destroyed ! “ Leave your city . Go across the sea to Cyprus . Even there you will not find any rest. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	23	13	Look at the land of the Babylonians . No one lives there anymore . The Assyrians have turned it into a place for desert creatures . They built their towers in order to attack it . They took everything out of its forts . They knocked down all its buildings .
NIRV	Isaiah	23	14	Men in the ships of Tarshish , cry out ! Mighty Tyre is destroyed !
NIRV	Isaiah	23	15	A time is coming when people will forget about Tyre for
NIRV	Isaiah	23	70	years , the Lord will punish Tyre . He will let it return to its way of life as a prostitute . It will earn its living with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth .
NIRV	Isaiah	23	16	“ Forgotten prostitute , pick up a harp . Walk through the city . Play the harp well . Sing many songs . Then you will be remembered. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	23	17	At the end of the
NIRV	Isaiah	23	18	But the money it earns will be set apart for the Lord . The money won ’ t be stored up or kept for Tyre . Instead , it will go to those who live the way the Lord wants them to . It will pay for plenty of food and fine clothes for them . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	24	24	The Lord is going to completely destroy everything on earth . He will twist its surface . He ’ ll scatter those who live on it .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	2	Priests and people alike will suffer . So will masters and their servants . And so will women and their female servants . Sellers and buyers alike will suffer . So will those who borrow and those who lend . And so will those who owe money and those who lend it .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	3	The earth will be completely destroyed . Everything of value will be taken out of it . That ’ s what the Lord has said .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	4	The earth will dry up completely . The world will dry up and waste away . The heavens will fade away along with the earth .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	5	The earth is polluted by its people . They haven ’ t obeyed the laws of the Lord . They haven ’ t done what he told them to do . They ’ ve broken the covenant that will last forever .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	6	So the Lord will send a curse on the earth . Its people will pay for what they ’ ve done . They will be burned up . Very few of them will be left .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	7	The vines and fresh wine will dry up completely . Those who used to have a good time will groan .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	8	The happy sounds of tambourines will be gone . The noise of those who enjoy wild parties will stop . The joyful music of harps will become silent .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	9	People will no longer sing as they drink wine . Beer will taste bitter to those who drink it .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	10	Destroyed cities will lie empty . People will lock themselves inside their houses .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	11	In the streets people will cry out for wine . All joy will turn into sadness . All joyful sounds will be driven out of the earth .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	12	All the buildings will be knocked down . Every city gate will be smashed to pieces .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	13	That ’ s how it will be on the earth . And that ’ s how it will be among the nations . It will be as when workers knock all but a few olives off the trees . It will be like a vine that has only a few grapes left after the harvest .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	14	Those who are left alive will shout for joy . People from the west will praise the Lord because he is the King .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	15	So give glory to him , you who live in the east . Honor the name of the Lord , you who are in the islands of the sea . He is the God of Israel .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	16	From one end of the earth to the other we hear singing . People are saying , “ Give glory to the God who always does what is right. ” But I said , “ I feel very bad . I ’ m getting weaker and weaker . How terrible it is for me ! People turn against one another . They can ’ t be trusted . So they turn against one another. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	24	17	Listen , you people of the earth . Terror , a pit and a trap are waiting for you .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	18	Anyone who runs away from the terror will fall into the pit . Anyone who climbs out of the pit will be caught in the trap . The Lord will open the windows of the skies . He will flood the land . The foundations of the earth will shake .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	19	The earth will be broken up . It will split open . It will be shaken to pieces .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	20	The earth will be unsteady like someone who is drunk . It will sway like a tent in the wind . Its sin will weigh so heavily on it that it will fall . It will never get up again .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	21	At that time the Lord will punish the spiritual forces of evil in the heavens above . He will also punish the kings on the earth below .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	22	They will be brought together like prisoners in chains . They ’ ll be locked up in prison . After many days the Lord will punish them .
NIRV	Isaiah	24	23	The Lord who rules over all will rule on Mount Zion in Jerusalem . The elders of the city will be there . They will see his great glory . His rule will be so glorious that the sun and moon will be too ashamed to shine . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	25	25	Lord , you are my God . I will honor you . I will praise your name . You have been perfectly faithful . You have done wonderful things . You had planned them long ago .
NIRV	Isaiah	25	2	You have turned cities into piles of trash . You have pulled down the high walls that were around them . You have destroyed our enemies ’ forts . They will never be rebuilt .
NIRV	Isaiah	25	3	Powerful nations will honor you . Even sinful people from their cities will have respect for you .
NIRV	Isaiah	25	4	Poor people have come to you for safety . You have kept needy people safe when they were in trouble . You have been a place to hide when storms came . You have been a shade from the heat of the sun . Evil people attack us . They are like a storm beating against a wall .
NIRV	Isaiah	25	5	They are like the heat of the desert . You stopped the noisy shouts of our enemies . You kept them from winning the battle over us and singing about it . You are like the shadow of a cloud that cools the earth .
NIRV	Isaiah	25	6	On Mount Zion the Lord who rules over all will prepare a feast for all the nations . The best and richest foods and the finest aged wines will be served .
NIRV	Isaiah	25	7	On that mountain the Lord will destroy the veil of sadness that covers all the nations . He will destroy the gloom that is spread over everyone .
NIRV	Isaiah	25	8	He will swallow up death forever . The Lord and King will wipe away the tears from everyone ’ s face . He will remove the shame of his people from the whole earth . The Lord has spoken .
NIRV	Isaiah	25	9	At that time they will say , “ He is our God . We trusted in him , and he saved us . He is the Lord . We trusted in him . Let us be filled with joy because he saved us. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	25	10	The Lord ’ s power will keep Mount Zion safe . But the people of Moab will be crushed in their land . They will be crushed just as straw is crushed in animal waste .
NIRV	Isaiah	25	11	They will try to swim their way out of it . They will spread out their hands in it , just as swimmers spread out their hands to swim . But God will bring down Moab ’ s pride . None of their skill will help them .
NIRV	Isaiah	25	12	He will pull down their high , strong walls . He will bring them down to the ground . He ’ ll bring them right down to the dust . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	26	26	At that time a song will be sung in the land of Judah . It will say , “ We have a strong city . God ’ s saving power surrounds it like walls and towers .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	2	Open its gates so that those who do what is right can enter . They are the people who remain faithful to God .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	3	Lord , you will give perfect peace to those who commit themselves to be faithful to you . That ’ s because they trust in you .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	4	“ Trust in the Lord forever . The Lord himself is the Rock . The Lord will keep us safe forever .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	5	He brings down those who are proud . He pulls down cities that have high walls . They fall down flat on the ground . He throws them down to the dust .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	6	The feet of those who were treated badly stomp on them . Those who were poor walk all over them. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	26	7	The path of godly people is level . You are the God who does what is right . You make their way smooth .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	8	Lord , we are living the way your laws command us to live . We are waiting for you to act . We want your honor and fame to be known .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	9	My heart longs for you at night . My spirit longs for you in the morning . You will come and judge the earth . Then the people of the world will learn to do what is right .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	10	Sometimes grace is shown to sinful people . But they still don ’ t learn to do what is right . They keep on doing evil even in a land where others are honest and fair . They don ’ t have any respect for the majesty of the Lord .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	11	Lord , you have raised your hand high to punish them . But they don ’ t even see it . Let them see how much you love your people . Then they will be put to shame . Let the fire you are saving for your enemies burn them up .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	12	Lord , you give us peace . You are the one who has done everything we ’ ve accomplished .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	13	Lord , you are our God . Other masters besides you have ruled over us . But your name is the only one we honor .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	14	Those other masters are now dead . They will never live again . Their spirits won ’ t rise from the dead . You punished them and destroyed them . You wiped out all memory of them .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	15	Lord , you have made our nation grow . You have made it larger . You have gained glory for yourself . You have increased the size of our land .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	16	Lord , when your people were suffering , they came to you . When you punished them , they could barely whisper a prayer .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	17	Lord , you made us like a woman who is about to have a baby . She groans and cries out in pain .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	18	We were pregnant and groaned with pain . But nothing was born . We didn ’ t bring your saving power to the earth . And the people of the world have not come to life .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	19	Lord , your people who have died will live again . Their bodies will rise from the dead . Let those who lie in the grave wake up and shout for joy . You give life , Lord , like the dew of the morning . So the earth will give up its dead people .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	20	My people , go into your houses . Shut the doors behind you . Hide yourselves for a little while . Do it until the Lord ’ s anger is over .
NIRV	Isaiah	26	21	He is coming from the place where he lives . He will punish the people of the earth for their sins . The blood spilled on the earth will be brought out into the open . The ground will no longer hide those who have been killed . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	27	27	At that time the Lord will punish Leviathan with his sword . His great , powerful and deadly sword will punish the serpent that glides through the sea . He will kill that twisting sea monster .
NIRV	Isaiah	27	2	At that time the Lord will sing about his fruitful vineyard . He will say ,
NIRV	Isaiah	27	3	“ I am the Lord . I watch over my vineyard . I water it all the time . I guard it day and night . I do it so no one can harm it .
NIRV	Isaiah	27	4	I am not angry with my vineyard . I wish thorns and bushes would come up in it . Then I would march out against them in battle . I would set all of them on fire .
NIRV	Isaiah	27	5	So the enemies of my people should come to me for safety . They should make peace with me . I will say it again . They should make peace with me. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	27	6	In days to come , Jacob ’ s people will put down roots like a vine . Israel will bud and bloom . They will fill the whole world with fruit .
NIRV	Isaiah	27	7	The Lord struck down those who struck down Israel . But he hasn ’ t punished Israel as much . The Lord killed those who killed many of his people . But he hasn ’ t punished his people as much .
NIRV	Isaiah	27	8	The Lord will use war to punish Israel . He will make them leave their land . With a strong blast of his anger he will drive them out . It will be as if the east wind were blowing .
NIRV	Isaiah	27	9	The people of Jacob will have to pay for their sin . Here is how they will show that their sin has been removed . They will make all the altar stones like limestone . They will crush them to pieces . No poles used to worship the female god named Asherah will be left standing . No incense altars will be left either .
NIRV	Isaiah	27	10	Cities that have high walls around them will become empty . They will be settlements with no one in them . They will be like a desert . Calves will eat and lie down in them . They will strip bare the branches of their trees .
NIRV	Isaiah	27	11	When their twigs are dry , they will be broken off . Then women will come and make fires with them . The people of Jacob don ’ t understand the Lord . So the God who made them won ’ t be concerned about them . Their Creator won ’ t be kind to them .
NIRV	Isaiah	27	12	At that time the Lord will separate Israel from other people . He will gather the Israelites together one by one . He will gather them from the Euphrates River to the Wadi of Egypt .
NIRV	Isaiah	27	13	At that time a loud trumpet will be blown . Those who were dying in Assyria will come and worship the Lord . So will those who were taken away to Egypt . All of them will worship the Lord on his holy mountain in Jerusalem . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	28	28	Grain must be ground up to make bread . A farmer separates it out . But he doesn ’ t go on doing it forever . He drives the wheels of a threshing cart over it . But he doesn ’ t use horses to grind the grain .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	2	The Lord will bring the strong and powerful king of Assyria against Samaria . The Lord will throw that city down to the ground with great force . It will be like a hailstorm . It will be like a wind that destroys everything . It will be like a driving rain and a flooding storm .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	3	That city is like a wreath . The leaders of Ephraim are drunk . They take pride in their city . But its enemies will walk all over it .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	4	It sits on a hill above a rich valley . The city is like a wreath of flowers whose glorious beauty is fading away . But it will become like figs that are ripe before harvest . As soon as people see them , they pick them and swallow them .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	5	At that time the Lord who rules over all will be like a glorious crown . He will be like a beautiful wreath for those of his people who will be left alive .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	6	He will help those who are fair when they judge . He will give strength to those who turn back their enemies at the city gate .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	7	Israel ’ s leaders are drunk from wine . They can ’ t walk straight . They are drunk from beer . They are unsteady on their feet . Priests and prophets drink beer . They can ’ t walk straight . They are mixed up from drinking too much wine . They drink too much beer . They are unsteady on their feet . The prophets see visions but don ’ t really understand them . The priests aren ’ t able to make good decisions .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	8	They throw up . All the tables are covered with the mess they ’ ve made . There isn ’ t one spot on the tables that isn ’ t smelly and dirty .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	9	The Lord ’ s people are making fun of him . They say , “ Who does he think he ’ s trying to teach ? Who does he think he ’ s explaining his message to ? Is it to children who do not need their mother ’ s milk anymore ? Is it to those who have just been taken from her breast ?
NIRV	Isaiah	28	10	Here is how he teaches . Do this and do that . There is a rule for this and a rule for that . Learn a little here and learn a little there. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	28	11	All right then , these people won ’ t listen to me . So God will speak to them . He will speak by using people who speak unfamiliar languages . He will speak by using the mouths of strangers .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	12	He said to his people , “ I am offering you a resting place . Let those who are tired rest. ” He continued , “ I am offering you a place of peace and quiet. ” But they wouldn ’ t listen .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	13	So then , here is what the Lord ’ s message will become to them . Do this and do that . There is a rule for this and a rule for that . Learn a little here and learn a little there . So when they try to go forward , they ’ ll fall back and be wounded . They ’ ll be trapped and captured .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	14	Listen to the Lord ’ s message , you who make fun of the truth . Listen , you who rule over these people in Jerusalem .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	15	You brag , “ We have entered into a covenant with the place of the dead . We have made an agreement with the grave . When a terrible plague comes to punish us , it can ’ t touch us . That ’ s because we depend on lies to keep us safe . We hide behind what isn ’ t true. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	28	16	So the Lord and King speaks . He says , “ Look ! I am laying a stone in Zion . It is a stone that has been tested . It is the most important stone for a firm foundation . The one who depends on that stone will never be shaken .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	17	I will use a measuring line to prove that you have not been fair . I will use a plumb line to prove that you have not done what is right . Hail will sweep away the lies you depend on to keep you safe . Water will flood your hiding place .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	18	Your covenant with death will be called off . The agreement you made with the place of the dead will not stand . When the terrible plague comes to punish you , you will be struck down by it .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	19	As often as it comes , it will carry you away . Morning after morning , day and night , it will come to punish you. ” If you understand this message , it will bring you absolute terror .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	20	You will be like someone whose bed is too short to lie down on . You will be like those whose blankets are too small to wrap themselves in .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	21	The Lord will rise up to judge , just as he did at Mount Perazim . He will get up to act , just as he did in the Valley of Gibeon . He ’ ll do his work , but it will be strange work . He ’ ll carry out his task , but it will be an unexpected one .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	22	Now stop making fun of me . If you don ’ t , your chains will become heavier . The Lord who rules over all has spoken to me . The Lord has told me he has ordered that the whole land be destroyed .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	23	Listen and hear my voice . Pay attention to what I ’ m saying .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	24	When a farmer plows in order to plant , does he plow without stopping ? Does he keep on breaking up the soil and making the field level ?
NIRV	Isaiah	28	25	When he ’ s made the surface even , doesn ’ t he plant caraway seeds ? Doesn ’ t he scatter cumin seeds ? Doesn ’ t he plant wheat in its proper place ? Doesn ’ t he plant barley where it belongs ? Doesn ’ t he plant spelt along the edge of the field ?
NIRV	Isaiah	28	26	His God directs him . He teaches him the right way to do his work .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	27	Caraway seeds are beaten out with a rod . They aren ’ t separated out under a threshing sled . Cumin seeds are beaten out with a stick . The wheel of a cart isn ’ t rolled over them .
NIRV	Isaiah	28	29	All these insights come from the Lord who rules over all . His advice is wonderful . His wisdom is glorious . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	29	29	Jerusalem , how terrible it will be for you ! Ariel , you are the city where David made his home . The years will come and go . Keep on celebrating your regular feasts .
NIRV	Isaiah	29	2	The Lord says , “ Ariel , I will surround you . Jerusalem , I will get ready to attack you . Your people will mourn . They will sing songs of sadness . I will make you like the front of an altar covered with blood .
NIRV	Isaiah	29	3	I will be like an army camped against you on all sides . I will surround you with towers in order to attack you . I will build my ramps all around you and set up my ladders .
NIRV	Isaiah	29	4	You will be brought down to the grave . You will speak from deep down inside the ground . Your words will be barely heard out of the dust . Your voice will sound like the voice of a ghost coming from under the ground . Your words will sound like a whisper out of the dust. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	29	5	Jerusalem , all your enemies will become like fine dust . Their terrifying armies will become like straw that the wind blows away . All of a sudden , in an instant ,
NIRV	Isaiah	29	6	the Lord who rules over all will come . He will come with thunder , earthquakes and a lot of noise . He ’ ll bring windstorms and rainstorms with him . He ’ ll send a blazing fire that will burn up everything .
NIRV	Isaiah	29	7	Armies from all the nations will fight against Ariel . They will attack it and its fort . They ’ ll surround it completely . But suddenly those armies will disappear like a dream . They will vanish like a vision in the night .
NIRV	Isaiah	29	8	It will be as when a hungry person dreams of eating , but wakes up still hungry . It will be as when a thirsty person dreams of drinking , but wakes up weak and still thirsty . In the same way , the armies from all the nations that fight against Mount Zion will disappear .
NIRV	Isaiah	29	9	People of Jerusalem , be shocked and amazed . Make yourselves blind so you can ’ t see anything . Get drunk , but not from wine . Be unsteady on your feet , but not because of beer .
NIRV	Isaiah	29	10	The Lord has made you fall into a deep sleep . He has closed the eyes of your prophets . He has covered the heads of your seers so they can ’ t see .
NIRV	Isaiah	29	11	For you , this whole vision is like words that are sealed up in a scroll . Suppose you give it to someone who can read . And suppose you say , “ Please read this for us. ” Then they ’ ll answer , “ I can ’ t . It ’ s sealed up. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	29	12	Or suppose you give the scroll to someone who can ’ t read . And suppose you say , “ Please read this for us. ” Then they ’ ll answer , “ I don ’ t know how to read. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	29	13	The Lord says , “ These people worship me only with their words . They honor me by what they say . But their hearts are far away from me . Their worship doesn ’ t mean anything to me . They teach nothing but human rules that they have been taught .
NIRV	Isaiah	29	14	So once more I will shock these people with many wonderful acts . I will destroy the wisdom of those who think they are so wise . I will do away with the cleverness of those who think they are so smart. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	29	15	How terrible it will be for people who try hard to hide their plans from the Lord ! They do their work in darkness . They think , “ Who sees us ? Who will know ? ”
NIRV	Isaiah	29	16	They turn everything upside down . How silly they are to think that potters are like the clay they work with ! Can what is made say to the one who made it , “ You didn ’ t make me ” ? Can the pot say to the potter , “ You don ’ t know anything ” ?
NIRV	Isaiah	29	17	In a very short time , Lebanon will be turned into rich farm lands . The rich farm lands will seem like a forest .
NIRV	Isaiah	29	18	At that time those who can ’ t hear will hear what is read from the scroll . Those who are blind will come out of gloom and darkness . They will be able to see .
NIRV	Isaiah	29	19	Those who aren ’ t proud will once again find their joy in the Lord . And those who are in need will find their joy in the Holy One of Israel .
NIRV	Isaiah	29	20	Those who don ’ t show any pity will vanish . Those who make fun of others will disappear . All those who look for ways to do what is evil will be cut off .
NIRV	Isaiah	29	21	Without any proof , they claim that a person is guilty . In court they try to trap the one who speaks up for others . By using dishonest witnesses they keep people who aren ’ t guilty from being treated fairly .
NIRV	Isaiah	29	22	Long ago the Lord saved Abraham from trouble . Now he says to Jacob ’ s people , “ You will not be ashamed anymore . Your faces will no longer grow pale with fear .
NIRV	Isaiah	29	23	You will see your children living among you . I myself will give you those children . Then you will honor my name . You will recognize how holy I am . I am the Holy One of Jacob . You will have great respect for me . I am the God of Israel .
NIRV	Isaiah	29	24	I will give understanding to you who find yourselves going astray . You who are always speaking against others will accept what I teach you. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	30	30	The Lord will cause people to hear his powerful voice . He will make them see his arm coming down to punish them . It will come down with burning anger and destroying fire . It will come down with rain , thunderstorms and hail .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	2	They go down to Egypt without asking me for advice . They look to Pharaoh to help them . They ask Egypt to keep them safe .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	3	But looking to Pharaoh will only bring them shame . Asking Egypt for help will bring them dishonor .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	4	Their officials have gone to the city of Zoan . Their messengers have arrived in Hanes .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	5	But the people of Judah will be put to shame . That ’ s because they are trusting in a nation that is useless to them . Egypt will not bring them any help or advantage . Instead , it will bring them shame and dishonor. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	30	6	Here is a prophecy the Lord gave me about the animals in the Negev Desert . Judah ’ s messengers carry their riches on the backs of donkeys . They carry their treasures on the humps of camels . They travel through a land of danger and suffering . It ’ s a land filled with lions . Poisonous snakes are also there . The messengers travel to a nation that can ’ t do them any good .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	7	They travel to Egypt , whose help is totally useless . That ’ s why I call it Rahab the Do-Nothing .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	8	The Lord said to me , “ Go now . Write on a tablet for the people of Judah what I am about to say . Also write it on a scroll . In days to come it will be a witness that lasts forever .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	9	That ’ s because these people of Judah refuse to obey me . They are children who tell lies . They will not listen to what I want to teach them .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	10	They say to the seers , ‘ Don ’ t see any more visions ! ’ They say to the prophets , ‘ Don ’ t give us any more visions of what is right ! Tell us pleasant things . Prophesy things we want to hear even if they aren ’ t true .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	11	Get out of our way ! Get off our path ! Keep the Holy One of Israel away from us ! ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	30	12	So the Holy One of Israel speaks . He says , “ You have turned your backs on what I have said . You have depended on telling people lies . You have crushed others .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	13	Those sins are like cracks in a high wall . They get bigger and bigger . Suddenly the wall breaks apart . Then it quickly falls down .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	14	It breaks into small pieces like a clay pot . It breaks up completely . Not one piece is left big enough for taking coals from a fireplace . Not one piece is left for dipping water out of a well. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	30	15	The Lord and King is the Holy One of Israel . He says , “ You will find peace and rest when you turn away from your sins and depend on me . You will receive the strength you need when you stay calm and trust in me . But you do not want to do what I tell you to .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	16	You said , ‘ No . We ’ ll escape on horses. ’ So you will have to escape ! You said , ‘ We ’ ll ride off on fast horses. ’ So those who chase you will use faster horses !
NIRV	Isaiah	30	17	When one of them dares you to fight , a thousand of you will run away . When five of them dare you , all of you will run away . So few of you will be left that you will be like a flagpole on top of a mountain . You will be like only one banner on a hill. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	30	18	But the Lord wants to have mercy on you . So he will rise up to give you his tender love . The Lord is a God who is always fair . Blessed are all those who wait for him to act !
NIRV	Isaiah	30	19	People of Zion , who live in Jerusalem , you won ’ t weep anymore . When you cry out to the Lord for help , he will have mercy on you . As soon as he hears you , he ’ ll answer you .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	20	He might treat you like prisoners . You might eat the bread of trouble . You might drink the water of suffering . But he will be your Teacher . He won ’ t hide himself anymore . You will see him with your own eyes .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	21	You will hear your Teacher ’ s voice behind you . You will hear it whether you turn to the right or the left . It will say , “ Here is the path I want you to take . So walk on it. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	30	22	Then you will get rid of the silver statues of your gods . You won ’ t have anything to do with the gold statues either . All of them are “ unclean. ” So you will throw them away like dirty rags . You will say to them , “ Get away from us ! ”
NIRV	Isaiah	30	23	The Lord will send rain on the seeds you plant in the ground . The crops that grow will be rich and plentiful . At that time your cattle will eat grass in rolling meadows .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	24	The oxen and donkeys that work the soil will eat the finest feed and crushed grain . The farmers will use pitchforks and shovels to separate it from the straw .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	25	At that time the towers of your enemies will fall down . Their soldiers will die . Streams of water will flow on every high mountain and hill .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	26	The moon will shine like the sun . And the sunlight will be seven times brighter than usual . It will be like the light of seven full days . That will happen when the Lord bandages and heals the wounds and bruises he has brought on his people .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	27	The Lord will come from far away in all his power and glory . He will show his burning anger . Thick clouds of smoke will be all around him . His mouth will speak angry words . The words from his tongue will be like a destroying fire .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	28	His breath will be like a rushing flood that rises up to the neck . He ’ ll separate out the nations he is going to destroy . He ’ ll place a bit in their jaws . It will lead them down the road to death .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	29	You will sing as you do on the night you celebrate a holy feast . Your hearts will be filled with joy . You will be as joyful as people playing their flutes as they go up to the mountain of the Lord . He is the Rock of Israel .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	31	The voice of the Lord will tear the Assyrians apart . He will strike them down with his scepter .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	32	He will strike them with his club to punish them . Each time he does , his people will celebrate with the music of harps and tambourines . He will use his powerful arm to strike down the Assyrians in battle .
NIRV	Isaiah	30	33	In the Valley of Ben Hinnom , Topheth has been prepared for a long time . It has been made ready for the king of Assyria . Its fire pit has been made deep and wide . It has plenty of wood for the fire . The breath of the Lord will be like a stream of burning sulfur . It will set the wood on fire . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	31	31	How terrible it will be for those who go down to Egypt for help ! How terrible for those who depend on horses ! They trust in how many chariots they have . They trust in how strong their horsemen are . But they don ’ t look to the Holy One of Israel . They don ’ t ask the Lord for his help .
NIRV	Isaiah	31	2	He too is wise . He can bring horrible trouble . He does what he says he ’ ll do . He ’ ll rise up against that evil nation . He ’ ll fight against those who help them .
NIRV	Isaiah	31	3	The men of Egypt are only human beings . They aren ’ t God . Their horses are only flesh and blood . They aren ’ t spirits . The Lord will reach out his powerful hand to punish everyone . The Egyptians provide help . But they will be tripped up . The people of Judah receive the help . But they will fall down . All of them will be destroyed .
NIRV	Isaiah	31	4	The Lord says to me , “ A powerful lion stands over its food and growls . A lot of shepherds can be brought together to drive it away . But the lion is not frightened by their shouts . It is not upset by the noise they make . In the same way , I will come down from heaven . I will fight on Mount Zion and on its hills . Nothing will drive me away . I am the Lord who rules over all .
NIRV	Isaiah	31	5	Like a bird hovering over its nest , I will guard Jerusalem . I will keep it safe . I will ‘ pass over ’ it and save it . I am the Lord who rules over all. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	31	6	People of Israel , return to the Lord . He ’ s the God you have so strongly opposed .
NIRV	Isaiah	31	7	You sinned when you made your gods out of silver and gold . The time will come when all of you will turn away from them .
NIRV	Isaiah	31	8	The Lord says , “ The Assyrians will be killed by swords . But the swords that kill them will not be used by human beings . The Assyrians will run away from those swords . But their young men will be caught and forced to work hard .
NIRV	Isaiah	31	9	Their hiding places will be destroyed when terror strikes them . Their commanders will see their enemy ’ s battle flags . Then they will be filled with panic , ” announces the Lord . His fire blazes out from Mount Zion . His furnace burns in Jerusalem . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	32	32	A king will come who will do what is right . His officials will govern fairly .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	2	Each official will be like a place to get out of the wind . He will be like a place to hide from storms . He ’ ll be like streams of water flowing in the desert . He ’ ll be like the shadow of a huge rock in a dry and thirsty land .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	3	Then the eyes of those who see won ’ t be closed anymore . The ears of those who hear will listen to the truth .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	4	People who are afraid will know and understand . Tongues that stutter will speak clearly .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	5	Foolish people won ’ t be considered noble anymore . Those who are worthless won ’ t be highly respected .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	6	Foolish people say foolish things . Their minds are set on doing evil things . They don ’ t do what is right . They tell lies about the Lord . They don ’ t give hungry people any food . They don ’ t let thirsty people have any water .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	7	Those who are worthless use sinful methods . They make evil plans against poor people . They destroy them with their lies . They do it even when those people are right .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	8	But those who are noble make noble plans . And by doing noble things they succeed . The Sinful Women in Jerusalem
NIRV	Isaiah	32	9	You women who are so contented , pay attention to me . You who feel so secure , listen to what I have to say .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	10	You feel secure now . But in a little over a year you will tremble with fear . The grape harvest will fail . There won ’ t be any fruit .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	11	So tremble , you contented women . Tremble with fear , you who feel so secure . Take off your fine clothes . Wrap yourselves in rags .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	12	Beat your chests to show how sad you are . The pleasant fields have been destroyed . The fruitful vines have dried up .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	13	My people ’ s land is overgrown with thorns and bushes . Mourn for all the houses that were once filled with joy . Cry over this city that used to be full of wild parties .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	14	The royal palace will be left empty . The noisy city will be deserted . The fort and lookout tower will become a dry and empty desert forever . Donkeys will enjoy being there . Flocks will eat there .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	15	That will continue until the Holy Spirit is poured out on us from heaven . Then the desert will be turned into rich farm lands . The rich farm lands will seem like a forest .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	16	In the desert , the Lord will make sure people do what is right . In the rich farm lands he will make sure they treat one another fairly .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	17	Doing what is right will bring peace and rest . When my people do that , they will stay calm and trust in the Lord forever .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	18	They will live in a peaceful land . Their homes will be secure . They will enjoy peace and quiet .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	19	Hail might strip the forests bare . Cities might be completely destroyed .
NIRV	Isaiah	32	20	But how blessed you people will be ! You will plant your seeds by every stream . You will let your cattle and donkeys wander anywhere they want to . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	33	33	How terrible it will be for you , you who destroy others ! Assyria , you haven ’ t been destroyed yet . How terrible for you , you who turn against others ! Others haven ’ t turned against you yet . When you stop destroying , you will be destroyed . When you stop turning against others , others will turn against you .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	2	Lord , have mercy on us . We long for you to help us . Make us strong every morning . Save us when we ’ re in trouble .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	3	At the roar of your army , the nations run away . When you rise up against them , they scatter .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	4	Nations , what you have taken in battle is destroyed . It ’ s as if young locusts had eaten it up . Like large numbers of locusts , people rush to get it .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	5	The Lord is honored . He lives in heaven . He will make sure Zion ’ s people only do what is fair and right .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	6	He will be the firm foundation for their entire lives . He will give them all the wisdom , knowledge and saving power they will ever need . Respect for the Lord is the key to that treasure .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	7	Look ! Judah ’ s brave men cry out loud in the streets . The messengers who were sent to bring peace weep bitter tears .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	8	The wide roads are deserted . No one travels on them . Our peace treaty with Assyria is broken . Those who witnessed it are looked down on . No one is respected .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	9	The land dries up and wastes away . Lebanon is full of shame and dries up . The rich land of Sharon is like the Arabah Desert . The trees of Bashan and Carmel drop their leaves .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	10	“ Now I will take action , ” says the Lord . “ Now I will be honored . Now I will be respected .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	11	Assyria , your plans and actions are like straw . Your anger is a fire that will destroy you .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	12	The nations will be burned to ashes . They will be like bushes that are cut down and set on fire .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	13	“ You nations far away , listen to what I have done ! My people who are near , recognize how powerful I am !
NIRV	Isaiah	33	14	The sinners in Zion are terrified . They tremble with fear . They say , ‘ Who of us can live through the Lord ’ s destroying fire ? Who of us can live through the fire that burns forever ? ’
NIRV	Isaiah	33	15	People must do what is right . They must be honest and tell the truth . They must not get rich by cheating others . Their hands must not receive money from those who want special favors . They must not let their ears listen to plans to commit murder . They must close their eyes to even thinking about doing what is evil .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	16	People like that will be kept safe . It will be as if they were living on high mountains . It will be as if they were living in a mountain fort . They will have all the food they need . And they will never run out of water. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	33	17	People of Judah , you will see the king in all his glory and majesty . You will view his kingdom spreading far and wide .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	18	You will think about what used to terrify you . You will say to yourself , “ Where is that chief officer of Assyria ? Where is the one who forced us to send gifts to his king ? Where is the officer in charge of the towers that were used when we were attacked ? ”
NIRV	Isaiah	33	19	You won ’ t see those proud people anymore . They spoke a strange language . None of us could understand it .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	20	Just look at Zion ! It ’ s the city where we celebrate our regular feasts . Turn your eyes toward Jerusalem . It will be a peaceful place to live in . It will be like a tent that will never be moved . Its stakes will never be pulled up . None of its ropes will be broken .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	21	There the Lord will be our Mighty One . It will be like a place of wide rivers and streams . No boat with oars will travel on them . No mighty ship will sail on them .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	22	That ’ s because the Lord is our judge . The Lord gives us our law . The Lord is our king . He will save us .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	23	The ropes on your ship hang loose . The mast isn ’ t very secure . The sail isn ’ t spread out . But the Lord will strike down the Assyrians . Then a large amount of goods will be taken from them and divided up . Even people who are disabled will carry off some of it .
NIRV	Isaiah	33	24	No one living in Zion will ever say again , “ I ’ m sick. ” And the sins of those who live there will be forgiven . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	34	34	Nations , come near and listen to me ! Pay attention to what I ’ m about to say . Let the earth and everything in it listen . Let the world and everything that comes out of it pay attention .
NIRV	Isaiah	34	2	The Lord is angry with all the nations . His anger is against all their armies . He will totally destroy them . He will have them killed .
NIRV	Isaiah	34	3	Those who are killed won ’ t be buried . Their dead bodies will be thrown on the ground . They will stink . Their blood will cover the mountains .
NIRV	Isaiah	34	4	All the stars in the sky will vanish . The heavens will be rolled up like a scroll . All the stars in the sky will fall like dried-up leaves from a vine . They will drop like wrinkled figs from a fig tree .
NIRV	Isaiah	34	5	The sword of the Lord will finish its deadly work in the sky . Then it will come down to strike Edom . He will totally destroy that nation .
NIRV	Isaiah	34	6	His sword will be red with blood . It will be covered with fat . The blood will flow like the blood of lambs and goats being sacrificed . The fat will be like the fat taken from the kidneys of rams . That ’ s because the Lord will offer a sacrifice in the city of Bozrah . He will kill many people in the land of Edom .
NIRV	Isaiah	34	7	The people and their leaders will be killed like wild oxen and young bulls . Their land will be wet with their blood . The dust will be covered with their fat .
NIRV	Isaiah	34	8	That ’ s because the Lord has set aside a day to pay Edom back . He has set aside a year to pay them back . He will pay them back for what they did to Zion .
NIRV	Isaiah	34	9	The streams of Edom will be turned into tar . Its dust will be turned into blazing sulfur . Its land will become burning tar .
NIRV	Isaiah	34	10	The fire will keep burning night and day . It can ’ t be put out . Its smoke will go up forever . Edom will lie empty for all time to come . No one will ever travel through it again .
NIRV	Isaiah	34	11	The desert owl and screech owl will make it their home . The great owl and the raven will build their nests there . God will use his measuring line to show how completely Edom will be destroyed . He will use his plumb line to show how empty Edom will become .
NIRV	Isaiah	34	12	Edom ’ s nobles won ’ t have anything left there that can be called a kingdom . All its princes will vanish .
NIRV	Isaiah	34	13	Thorns will cover its forts . Bushes and weeds will cover its safest places . It will become a home for wild dogs . It will become a place where owls live .
NIRV	Isaiah	34	14	Desert creatures will meet with hyenas . Wild goats will call out to each other . Night creatures will also lie down there . They will find places where they can rest .
NIRV	Isaiah	34	15	Owls will make their nests and lay their eggs there . And they will hatch them . They will take care of their little ones under the shadow of their wings . Male and female falcons will also gather there .
NIRV	Isaiah	34	16	Look in the book of the Lord . Here is what you will read there . None of those animals will be missing . Male and female alike will be there . The Lord himself has commanded it . And his Spirit will gather them together .
NIRV	Isaiah	34	17	The Lord will decide what part of the land goes to each animal . Then he will give each one its share . It will belong to them forever . And they will live there for all time to come . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	35	35	The desert and the dry ground will be glad . The dry places will be full of joy . Flowers will grow there . Like the first crocus in the spring ,
NIRV	Isaiah	35	2	the desert will bloom with flowers . It will be very glad and shout for joy . The glorious beauty of Lebanon will be given to it . It will be as beautiful as the rich lands of Carmel and Sharon . Everyone will see the glory of the Lord . They will see the beauty of our God .
NIRV	Isaiah	35	3	Strengthen the hands of those who are weak . Help those whose knees give way .
NIRV	Isaiah	35	4	Say to those whose hearts are afraid , “ Be strong and do not fear . Your God will come . He will pay your enemies back . He will come to save you. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	35	5	Then the eyes of those who are blind will be opened . The ears of those who can ’ t hear will be unplugged .
NIRV	Isaiah	35	6	Those who can ’ t walk will leap like a deer . And those who can ’ t speak will shout for joy . Water will pour out in dry places . Streams will flow in the desert .
NIRV	Isaiah	35	7	The burning sand will become a pool of water . The thirsty ground will become bubbling springs . In the places where wild dogs once lay down , tall grass and papyrus will grow .
NIRV	Isaiah	35	8	A wide road will go through the land . It will be called the Way of Holiness . Only those who lead a holy life can use it . “ Unclean ” and foolish people can ’ t walk on it .
NIRV	Isaiah	35	9	No lions will use it . No hungry wild animals will be on it . None of them will be there . Only people who have been set free will walk on it .
NIRV	Isaiah	35	10	Those the Lord has saved will return to their land . They will sing as they enter the city of Zion . Joy that lasts forever will be like beautiful crowns on their heads . They will be filled with gladness and joy . Sorrow and sighing will be gone . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	36	36	Sennacherib attacked and captured all the cities of Judah that had high walls around them . It was in the 14th year of the rule of Hezekiah . Sennacherib was king of Assyria .
NIRV	Isaiah	36	2	He sent his field commander from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem . He sent him along with a large army . The commander stopped at the channel that brings water from the Upper Pool . It was on the road to the Washerman ’ s Field .
NIRV	Isaiah	36	3	Eliakim , Shebna and Joah went out to him . Eliakim , the son of Hilkiah , was in charge of the palace . Shebna was the secretary . Joah , the son of Asaph , kept the records .
NIRV	Isaiah	36	4	The field commander said to them , “ Give Hezekiah this message . Tell him , “ ‘ Sennacherib is the great king of Assyria . He says , “ Why are you putting your faith in what your king says ?
NIRV	Isaiah	36	5	You say you have a military plan . You say you have a strong army . But your words don ’ t mean anything . Who are you depending on ? Why don ’ t you want to stay under my control ?
NIRV	Isaiah	36	6	Look , I know you are depending on Egypt . Why are you doing that ? Egypt is nothing but a broken papyrus stem . Try leaning on it . It will only cut your hand . Pharaoh , the king of Egypt , is just like that to everyone who depends on him .
NIRV	Isaiah	36	7	But suppose you say to me , ‘ We are depending on the Lord our God. ’ Didn ’ t Hezekiah remove your god ’ s high places and altars ? Didn ’ t Hezekiah say to the people of Judah and Jerusalem , ‘ You must worship at the altar in Jerusalem ’ ?
NIRV	Isaiah	36	8	“ ‘ “ Come on . Make a deal with my master , the king of Assyria . I ’ ll give you 2,000 horses . But only if you can put riders on them !
NIRV	Isaiah	36	9	You are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen . You can ’ t drive away even the least important officer among my master ’ s officials .
NIRV	Isaiah	36	10	Besides , do you think I ’ ve come without being sent by the Lord ? Have I come to attack and destroy this land without receiving a message from him ? The Lord himself told me to march out against your country . He told me to destroy it. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	36	11	Then Eliakim , Shebna and Joah spoke to the field commander . They said , “ Please speak to us in the Aramaic language . We understand it . Don ’ t speak to us in Hebrew . If you do , the people on the wall will be able to understand you. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	36	12	But the commander replied , “ My master sent me to say these things . Are these words only for your master and you to hear ? Aren ’ t they also for the people sitting on the wall ? They are going to suffer just like you . They ’ ll have to eat their own waste . They ’ ll have to drink their own urine. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	36	13	Then the commander stood up and spoke in the Hebrew language . He called out , “ Pay attention to what the great king of Assyria is telling you .
NIRV	Isaiah	36	14	He says , ‘ Don ’ t let Hezekiah trick you . He can ’ t save you !
NIRV	Isaiah	36	15	Don ’ t let Hezekiah talk you into trusting in the Lord . Don ’ t believe him when he says , “ You can be sure that the Lord will save us . This city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria. ” ’
NIRV	Isaiah	36	16	“ Don ’ t listen to Hezekiah . The king of Assyria says , ‘ Make a peace treaty with me . Come over to my side . Then each one of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig tree . Each one of you will drink water from your own well .
NIRV	Isaiah	36	17	You will do that until I come back . Then I ’ ll take you to a land just like yours . It ’ s a land that has a lot of grain and fresh wine . It has plenty of bread and vineyards .
NIRV	Isaiah	36	18	“ ‘ Don ’ t let Hezekiah fool you . He ’ s telling you a lie when he says , “ The Lord will save us. ” Have the gods of any nations ever saved their lands from the power of the king of Assyria ?
NIRV	Isaiah	36	19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? Have they saved Samaria from my power ?
NIRV	Isaiah	36	20	Which one of all the gods of those countries has been able to save their lands from me ? So how can the Lord save Jerusalem from my power ? ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	36	21	But the people remained silent . They didn ’ t say anything . That ’ s because King Hezekiah had commanded , “ Don ’ t answer him. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	36	22	Then Eliakim , the son of Hilkiah , went to Hezekiah . Eliakim was in charge of the palace . Shebna the secretary went with him . So did Joah , the son of Asaph . Joah kept the records . All of them went to Hezekiah with their clothes torn . They told him what the field commander had said . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	37	37	So Sennacherib , the king of Assyria , took the army tents down . Then he left . He returned to Nineveh and stayed there .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	2	Hezekiah sent Eliakim , who was in charge of the palace , to Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz . He also sent the leading priests and Shebna the secretary to him . All of them were wearing rough clothing .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	3	They told Isaiah , “ Hezekiah says , ‘ Today we ’ re in great trouble . The Lord is warning us . He ’ s bringing shame on us . Sometimes babies come to the moment when they should be born . But their mothers aren ’ t strong enough to give birth to them . Today we are like those mothers . We aren ’ t strong enough to save ourselves .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	4	Perhaps the Lord your God will hear everything the field commander has said . His master , the king of Assyria , has sent him to make fun of the living God . Maybe the Lord your God will punish him for what he has heard him say . So pray for the remaining people who are still alive here. ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	37	5	King Hezekiah ’ s officials came to Isaiah .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	6	Then he said to them , “ Tell your master , ‘ The Lord says , “ Do not be afraid of what you have heard . The officers who are under the king of Assyria have spoken evil things against me .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	7	Listen ! I will send him news from his own country . It will make him want to return home . There I will have him cut down by a sword. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	37	8	The field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish . So the commander pulled his troops back from Jerusalem . He went to join the king . He found out that the king was fighting against Libnah .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	9	During that time Sennacherib received a report . He was told that Tirhakah was marching out to fight against him . Tirhakah was the king of Cush . When Sennacherib heard the report , he sent messengers again to Hezekiah with a letter . It said ,
NIRV	Isaiah	37	10	“ Tell Hezekiah , the king of Judah , ‘ Don ’ t let the god you depend on trick you . He says , “ Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria. ” But don ’ t believe him .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	11	I ’ m sure you have heard about what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries . They have destroyed them completely . So do you think you will be saved ?
NIRV	Isaiah	37	12	The kings who ruled before me destroyed many nations . Did the gods of those nations save them ? Did the gods of Gozan , Harran or Rezeph save them ? What about the gods of the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar ?
NIRV	Isaiah	37	13	Where is the king of Hamath ? Where is the king of Arpad ? Where are the kings of Lair , Sepharvaim , Hena and Ivvah ? ’ ” Hezekiah Prays to the Lord
NIRV	Isaiah	37	14	When Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers , he read it . Then he went up to the Lord ’ s temple . There he spread the letter out in front of the Lord .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	15	Hezekiah prayed to the Lord . He said ,
NIRV	Isaiah	37	16	“ Lord who rules over all , you are the God of Israel . You sit on your throne between the cherubim . You alone are God over all the kingdoms on earth . You have made heaven and earth .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	17	Listen , Lord . Hear us . Open your eyes , Lord . Look at the trouble we ’ re in . Listen to what Sennacherib is saying . You are the living God . And he dares to make fun of you !
NIRV	Isaiah	37	18	“ Lord , it ’ s true that the kings of Assyria have completely destroyed many nations and their lands .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	19	They have thrown the statues of the gods of those nations into the fire . And they have destroyed them . That ’ s because they weren ’ t really gods at all . They were nothing but statues made out of wood and stone . They were made by human hands .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	20	Lord our God , save us from the power of Sennacherib . Then all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you are the only God. ” Sennacherib Falls From Power
NIRV	Isaiah	37	21	Isaiah sent a message to Hezekiah . Isaiah said , “ The Lord is the God of Israel . He says , ‘ You have prayed to me about Sennacherib , the king of Assyria .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	22	So here is the message the Lord has spoken against him . The Lord is telling him , “ ‘ “ You will not win the battle over Zion . Its people hate you and make fun of you . The people of Jerusalem lift up their heads proudly as you run away .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	23	Who have you laughed at ? Who have you spoken evil things against ? Who have you raised your voice against ? Who have you looked at so proudly ? You have done it against me . I am the Holy One of Israel !
NIRV	Isaiah	37	24	Through your messengers you have laughed at me again and again . And you have said , ‘ I have many chariots . With them I have climbed to the tops of the mountains . I ’ ve climbed the highest mountains in Lebanon . I ’ ve cut down its tallest cedar trees . I ’ ve cut down the best of its juniper trees . I ’ ve reached its farthest mountains . I ’ ve reached its finest forests .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	25	I ’ ve dug wells in other lands . I ’ ve drunk the water from them . I ’ ve walked through all the streams of Egypt . I ’ ve dried up every one of them. ’
NIRV	Isaiah	37	26	“ ‘ “ But I , the Lord , say , ‘ Haven ’ t you heard what I have done ? Long ago I arranged for you to do this . In days of old I planned it . Now I have made it happen . You have turned cities with high walls into piles of stone .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	27	Their people do not have any power left . They are troubled and put to shame . They are like plants in the field . They are like new green plants . They are like grass that grows on a roof . It dries up before it is completely grown .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	28	“ ‘ “ ‘ But I know where you are . I know when you come and go . I know how very angry you are with me .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	29	You roar against me and brag . And I have heard your bragging . So I will put my hook in your nose . I will put my bit in your mouth . And I will make you go home by the same way you came. ’ ” ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	37	30	The Lord said , “ Hezekiah , here is a sign for you . “ This year you will eat what grows by itself . Next year you will eat what grows from that . But in the third year you will plant your crops and gather them in . You will plant your grapevines and eat their fruit .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	31	The people of the kingdom of Judah who are still alive will be like plants . Once more they will put down roots and produce fruit .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	32	Out of Jerusalem will come the people who remain . Out of Mount Zion will come those who are still left alive . My great love will make sure that happens . I rule over all .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	33	“ Here is a message from me about the king of Assyria . I say , “ ‘ He will not enter this city . He will not even shoot an arrow at it . He will not come near it with a shield . He will not build a ramp in order to climb over its walls .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	34	By the way that he came he will go home . He will not enter this city , ’ announces the Lord .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	35	‘ I will guard this city and save it . I will do it for myself . And I will do it for my servant David. ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	37	36	Then the angel of the Lord went into the camp of the Assyrians . He put to death 185,000 soldiers there . The people of Jerusalem got up the next morning . They looked out and saw all the dead bodies .
NIRV	Isaiah	37	38	One day Sennacherib was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisrok . His sons Adrammelek and Sharezer killed him with their swords . Then they escaped to the land of Ararat . Esarhaddon became the next king after his father Sennacherib . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	38	38	In those days Hezekiah became very sick . He knew he was about to die . Isaiah went to see him . Isaiah was the son of Amoz . Isaiah told Hezekiah , “ The Lord says , ‘ Put everything in order . Make out your will . You are going to die soon . You will not get well again. ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	38	2	Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall . He prayed to the Lord . He said ,
NIRV	Isaiah	38	3	“ Lord , please remember how faithful I ’ ve been to you . I ’ ve lived the way you wanted me to . I ’ ve served you with all my heart . I ’ ve done what is good in your sight. ” And Hezekiah wept bitterly .
NIRV	Isaiah	38	4	A message from the Lord came to Isaiah . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Isaiah	38	5	“ Go and speak to Hezekiah . Tell him , ‘ The Lord , the God of King David , says , “ I have heard your prayer . I have seen your tears . I will add
NIRV	Isaiah	38	15	“ But what can I say ? You have promised to heal me . And you yourself have done it . Once I was proud and bitter . But now I will live the rest of my life free of pride .
NIRV	Isaiah	38	6	And I will save you and this city from the power of the king of Assyria . I will guard this city .
NIRV	Isaiah	38	7	“ ‘ “ Here is a sign from me . It will show you that I will heal you , just as I promised I would .
NIRV	Isaiah	38	8	The shadow that was made by the sun has gone down ten steps on the stairway of Ahaz . I will make it go back up those ten steps. ” ’ ” So the shadow went back up the ten steps it had gone down .
NIRV	Isaiah	38	9	Here is a song of praise that was written by Hezekiah , the king of Judah . He wrote it after he was sick and had gotten well again .
NIRV	Isaiah	38	10	I said , “ I ’ m enjoying the best years of my life . Must I now go through the gates of death ? Will the rest of my years be taken away from me ? ”
NIRV	Isaiah	38	11	I said , “ Lord , I ’ ll never see you again while I ’ m still alive . I ’ ll never see people anymore . I ’ ll never again be with those who live in this world .
NIRV	Isaiah	38	12	My body is like a shepherd ’ s tent . It has been pulled down and carried off . My life is like a piece of cloth that I ’ ve rolled up . You have cut it off from the loom . In a short period of time you have brought my life to an end .
NIRV	Isaiah	38	13	I waited patiently until sunrise . But like a lion you broke all my bones . In a short period of time you have brought my life to an end .
NIRV	Isaiah	38	14	I cried softly like a weak little bird . I sounded like a dove as I mourned . My eyes grew tired as I looked up toward heaven . Lord , my life is in danger . Please come and help me !
NIRV	Isaiah	38	16	Lord , people find the will to live because you keep your promises . And my spirit also finds life in your promises . You brought me back to health . You let me live .
NIRV	Isaiah	38	17	I ’ m sure it was for my benefit that I suffered such great pain . You love me . You kept me from going down into the pit of death . You have put all my sins behind your back .
NIRV	Isaiah	38	18	People in the grave can ’ t praise you . Dead people can ’ t sing praise to you . Those who go down to the grave can ’ t hope for you to be faithful to them .
NIRV	Isaiah	38	19	It is those who are alive who praise you . And that ’ s what I ’ m doing today . Parents tell their children about how faithful you are .
NIRV	Isaiah	38	20	“ The Lord will save me . So we will sing and play music on stringed instruments . We will sing all the days of our lives in the Lord ’ s temple. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	38	21	When Hezekiah was sick , Isaiah had said , “ Press some figs together . Spread them on a piece of cloth . Apply them to Hezekiah ’ s boil . Then he ’ ll get well again. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	38	22	At that time Hezekiah had asked , “ What will the sign be to prove I ’ ll go up to the Lord ’ s temple ? ” That ’ s when the Lord had made the shadow go back ten steps . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	39	39	At that time Marduk-Baladan , the king of Babylon , sent Hezekiah letters and a gift . He had heard that Hezekiah had been sick but had gotten well again . Marduk-Baladan was the son of Baladan .
NIRV	Isaiah	39	2	Hezekiah gladly received the messengers . He showed them what was in his storerooms . He showed them the silver and gold . He took them to where the spices and the fine olive oil were kept . He showed them where he kept all his weapons . And he showed them all his treasures . In fact , he showed them everything that was in his palace and in his whole kingdom .
NIRV	Isaiah	39	3	Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah . Isaiah asked him , “ What did those men say ? Where did they come from ? ” “ They came from a land far away , ” Hezekiah said . “ They came to me from Babylon. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	39	4	Isaiah asked , “ What did they see in your palace ? ” “ They saw everything in my palace , ” Hezekiah said . “ I showed them all my treasures. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	39	5	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah , “ Listen to the message of the Lord who rules over all . He says ,
NIRV	Isaiah	39	6	‘ You can be sure the time will come when everything in your palace will be carried off to Babylon . Everything the kings before you have stored up until this day will be taken away . There will not be anything left , ’ says the Lord .
NIRV	Isaiah	39	7	‘ Some of the members of your family line will be taken away . They will be your own flesh and blood . They will include the children who will be born into your family line . And they will serve the king of Babylon in his palace. ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	39	8	“ The message the Lord has spoken through you is good , ” Hezekiah replied . He thought , “ There will be peace and safety while I ’ m still living. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	40	40	“ Comfort my people , ” says your God . “ Comfort them .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	2	Speak tenderly to the people of Jerusalem . Announce to them that their hard labor has been completed . Tell them that their sin has been paid for . Tell them the Lord has punished them enough for all their sins. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	40	3	A messenger is calling out , “ In the desert prepare the way for the Lord . Make a straight road through it for our God .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	4	Every valley will be filled in . Every mountain and hill will be made level . The rough ground will be smoothed out . The rocky places will be made flat .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	5	Then the glory of the Lord will appear . And everyone will see it together . The Lord has spoken. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	40	6	Another messenger says , “ Cry out. ” And I said , “ What should I cry ? ” “ Cry out , ‘ All people are like grass . They don ’ t stay faithful to me any longer than wildflowers last .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	7	The grass dries up . The flowers fall to the ground . That happens when the Lord makes his wind blow on them . So people are just like grass .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	8	The grass dries up . The flowers fall to the ground . But what our God says will stand forever. ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	40	9	Zion , you are bringing good news to your people . Go up on a high mountain and announce it . Jerusalem , you are bringing good news to them . Shout the message loudly . Shout it out loud . Don ’ t be afraid . Say to the towns of Judah , “ Your God is coming ! ”
NIRV	Isaiah	40	10	The Lord and King is coming with power . He rules with a powerful arm . He has set his people free . He is bringing them back as his reward . He has won the battle over their enemies .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	11	He takes care of his flock like a shepherd . He gathers the lambs in his arms . He carries them close to his heart . He gently leads those that have little ones .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	12	Who has measured the oceans by using the palm of his hand ? Who has used the width of his hand to mark off the sky ? Who has measured out the dust of the earth in a basket ? Who has weighed the mountains on scales ? Who has weighed the hills in a balance ?
NIRV	Isaiah	40	13	Who can ever understand the Spirit of the Lord ? Who can ever give him advice ?
NIRV	Isaiah	40	14	Did the Lord have to ask anyone to help him understand ? Did he have to ask someone to teach him the right way ? Who taught him what he knows ? Who showed him how to understand ?
NIRV	Isaiah	40	15	The nations are only a drop in a bucket to him . He considers them as nothing but dust on the scales . He weighs the islands as if they were only fine dust .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	16	Lebanon doesn ’ t have enough trees to keep his altar fires burning . It doesn ’ t have enough animals to sacrifice as burnt offerings to him .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	17	To him , all the nations don ’ t amount to anything . He considers them to be worthless . In fact , they are less than nothing in his sight .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	18	So who will you compare God with ? Is there any other god like him ?
NIRV	Isaiah	40	19	Will you compare him with a statue of a god ? Anyone who works with metal can make a statue . Then another worker covers it with gold and makes silver chains for it .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	20	But someone who is too poor to bring that kind of offering will choose some wood that won ’ t rot . Then they look for a skilled worker . They pay the worker to make a statue of a god that won ’ t fall over .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	21	Don ’ t you know who made everything ? Haven ’ t you heard about him ? Hasn ’ t it been told to you from the beginning ? Haven ’ t you understood it ever since the earth was made ?
NIRV	Isaiah	40	22	God sits on his throne high above the earth . Its people look like grasshoppers to him . He spreads out the heavens like a cover . He sets it up like a tent to live in .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	23	He takes the power of princes away from them . He reduces the rulers of this world to nothing .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	24	They are planted . They are scattered like seeds . They put down roots in the ground . But as soon as that happens , God blows on them and they dry up . Then a windstorm sweeps them away like straw .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	25	“ So who will you compare me with ? Who is equal to me ? ” says the Holy One .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	26	Look up toward the sky . Who created everything you see ? The Lord causes the stars to come out at night one by one . He calls out each one of them by name . His power and strength are great . So none of the stars is missing .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	27	Family of Jacob , why do you complain , “ The Lord doesn ’ t notice our condition ” ? People of Israel , why do you say , “ Our God doesn ’ t pay any attention to our rightful claims ” ?
NIRV	Isaiah	40	28	Don ’ t you know who made everything ? Haven ’ t you heard about him ? The Lord is the God who lives forever . He created everything on earth . He won ’ t become worn out or get tired . No one will ever know how great his understanding is .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	29	He gives strength to those who are tired . He gives power to those who are weak .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	30	Even young people become worn out and get tired . Even the best of them trip and fall .
NIRV	Isaiah	40	31	But those who trust in the Lord will receive new strength . They will fly as high as eagles . They will run and not get tired . They will walk and not grow weak . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	41	41	The Lord says , “ People who live on the islands , come and stand quietly in front of me . Let the nations gain new strength in order to state their case . Let them come forward and speak . Let us go to court and find out who is right .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	2	“ Who has stirred up a king from the east ? Who has helped him win his battles ? I hand nations over to him . I bring kings under his control . He turns them into dust with his sword . With his bow he turns them into straw blowing in the wind .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	3	He hunts them down . Then he moves on unharmed . He travels so fast that his feet don ’ t seem to touch the ground .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	4	Who has made that happen ? Who has carried it out ? Who has created all the people who have ever lived ? I , the Lord , have done it . I was with the first of them . And I will be with the last of them. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	41	5	The people on the islands have seen that king coming . And it has made them afraid . People tremble with fear from one end of the earth to the other . They come and gather together .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	6	They help one another . They say to one another , “ Be strong ! ”
NIRV	Isaiah	41	7	One skilled worker makes a statue of a god . Another covers it with gold . The first worker says to the second , “ You have done a good job. ” Another worker smooths out the metal with a hammer . Still another gives the statue its final shape . The one who hammers says to the one who shapes , “ You have done a good job. ” Then they nail the statue down so it won ’ t fall over .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	8	The Lord says , “ People of Israel , you are my servants . Family of Jacob , I have chosen you . You are the children of my friend Abraham .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	9	I gathered you from one end of the earth to the other . From the farthest places on earth I brought you together . I said , ‘ You are my servants. ’ I have chosen you . I have not turned my back on you .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	10	So do not be afraid . I am with you . Do not be terrified . I am your God . I will make you strong and help you . I will hold you safe in my hands . I always do what is right .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	11	“ All those who are angry with you will be put to shame . And they will be dishonored . Those who oppose you will be destroyed . And they will vanish .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	12	You might search for your enemies . But you will not find them . Those who go to war against you will completely disappear .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	13	I am the Lord your God . I take hold of your right hand . I say to you , ‘ Do not be afraid . I will help you. ’
NIRV	Isaiah	41	14	Family of Jacob , you are as weak as a worm . But do not be afraid . People of Israel , there are only a few of you . But do not be afraid . I myself will help you , ” announces the Lord . He is the one who sets his people free . He is the Holy One of Israel .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	15	He says , “ I will make you into a threshing sled . It will be new and sharp . It will have many teeth . You will grind the mountains down and crush them . You will turn the hills into nothing but straw .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	16	You will toss them in the air . A strong wind will catch them and blow them away . You will be glad because I will make that happen . You will praise me . I am the Holy One of Israel .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	17	“ Those who are poor and needy search for water . But there isn ’ t any . Their tongues are dry because they are thirsty . But I will help them . I am the Lord . I will not desert them . I am Israel ’ s God .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	18	I will make streams flow on the bare hilltops . I will make springs come up in the valleys . I will turn the desert into pools of water . I will turn the dry and cracked ground into flowing springs .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	19	I will make trees grow in the desert . I will plant cedar and acacia trees there . I will plant myrtle and olive trees there . I will make juniper trees grow in the dry and empty desert . I will plant fir and cypress trees there .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	20	Then people will see and know that my powerful hand has done it . They will consider and understand that I have created it . I am the Holy One of Israel. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	41	21	The Lord says to the nations and their gods , “ State your case. ” Jacob ’ s King says to them , “ Prove your case to me .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	22	Tell us , you false gods , what is going to happen . Tell us what happened in the past . Then we can check it out and see if it is really true . Or announce to us the things that will take place .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	23	Tell us what will happen in the days ahead . Then we will know that you are gods . Do something . It does not matter whether it is good or bad . Then we will be terrified and filled with fear .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	24	But you false gods are less than nothing . Your actions are completely worthless . I hate it when people worship you .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	25	“ I have stirred up a king who will come from the north . He lives in the east . He will bring honor to me . He walks all over rulers as if they were mud . He steps on them just as a potter stomps on clay .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	26	Which one of you false gods said those things would happen before they did ? Who told us about them so we could know them ? Who told us ahead of time ? Who told us so we could say , ‘ You are right ’ ? None of you false gods told us about them . None of you told us ahead of time . In fact , no one heard you say anything at all .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	27	I was the first to tell Zion . I said , ‘ Look ! The people of Israel are coming back ! ’ I sent a messenger to Jerusalem with the good news .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	28	I look , but there is no one among the gods that can give me advice . None of them can answer when I ask them the simplest question .
NIRV	Isaiah	41	29	So they are not really gods at all . What they do does not amount to anything . They are as useless as wind . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	42	11	Let the desert and its towns raise their voices . Let those who live in the settlements of Kedar be glad . Let the people of Sela sing for joy . Let them shout from the tops of the mountains .
NIRV	Isaiah	42	12	Let them give glory to the Lord . Let them praise him in the islands .
NIRV	Isaiah	42	13	The Lord will march out like a mighty warrior . He will stir up his anger like a soldier getting ready to fight . He will shout the battle cry . And he will win the battle over his enemies .
NIRV	Isaiah	42	14	The Lord says , “ For a long time I have kept silent . I have been calm and quiet . But now , like a woman having a baby , I cry out . I gasp and pant .
NIRV	Isaiah	42	15	I will completely destroy the mountains and hills . I will dry up everything that grows there . I will turn rivers into dry land . I will dry up the pools .
NIRV	Isaiah	42	16	Israel is blind . So I will lead them along paths they had not known before . I will guide them on roads they are not familiar with . I will turn the darkness into light as they travel . I will make the rough places smooth . Those are the things I will do . I will not desert my people .
NIRV	Isaiah	42	17	Some people trust in statues of gods . They say to them , ‘ You are our gods. ’ But they will be dishonored . They will be put to shame . Israel Can ’ t See or Hear
NIRV	Isaiah	42	18	“ Israel , listen to me ! You can hear , but you do not understand . Look to me ! You can see , but you do not know what you are seeing .
NIRV	Isaiah	42	19	The people of Israel serve me . But who is more blind than they are ? Who is more deaf than the messengers I send ? Who is more blind than the one who has promised to be faithful to me ? Who is more blind than the servant of the Lord ?
NIRV	Isaiah	42	20	Israel , you have seen many things . But you do not pay any attention to me . Your ears are open . But you do not listen to anything I say. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	42	21	The Lord wanted his people to see how great and glorious his law is . He wanted to show them that he always does what is right .
NIRV	Isaiah	42	22	Enemies have carried off everything they own . All my people are trapped in pits or hidden away in prisons . They themselves have become like stolen goods . No one can save them . They have been carried off . And there is no one who will say , “ Send them back. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	42	23	Family of Jacob , who among you will listen to what I ’ m saying ? People of Israel , which one of you will pay close attention in days to come ?
NIRV	Isaiah	42	24	Who allowed you to be carried off like stolen goods ? Who handed you over to robbers ? The Lord did it ! We have sinned against him . Israel , you wouldn ’ t follow his ways . You didn ’ t obey his law .
NIRV	Isaiah	42	25	So he poured out his great anger on you . He had many of you killed in battle . You were surrounded by flames . But you didn ’ t realize what was happening . Many of you were destroyed . But you didn ’ t learn anything from it . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	43	43	Family of Jacob , the Lord created you . People of Israel , he formed you . He says , “ Do not be afraid . I will set you free . I will send for you by name . You belong to me .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	2	You will pass through deep waters . But I will be with you . You will pass through the rivers . But their waters will not sweep over you . You will walk through fire . But you will not be burned . The flames will not harm you .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	3	I am the Lord your God . I am the Holy One of Israel . I am the one who saves you . I will give up Egypt to set you free . I will give up Cush and Seba for you .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	4	You are priceless to me . I love you and honor you . So I will trade other people for you . I will give up other nations to save your lives .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	5	Do not be afraid . I am with you . I will bring your people back from the east . I will gather you from the west .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	6	I will say to the north , ‘ Let them go ! ’ And I will say to the south , ‘ Do not hold them back. ’ Bring my sons from far away . Bring my daughters from the farthest places on earth .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	7	Bring back everyone who belongs to me . I created them to bring glory to me . I formed them and made them. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	43	8	Lead my people into court . They have eyes but can ’ t see . Bring those who have ears but can ’ t hear .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	9	All the nations are gathering together . All of them are coming . Which one of their gods said ahead of time that the people of Israel would return ? Which of them told us anything at all about the past ? Let them bring in their witnesses to prove they were right . Then others will hear them . And they will say , “ What they said is true. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	43	10	“ People of Israel , you are my witnesses , ” announces the Lord . “ I have chosen you to be my servant . I wanted you to know me and believe in me . I wanted you to understand that I am the one and only God . Before me , there was no other god at all . And there will not be any god after me .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	11	I am the one and only Lord . I am the only one who can save you .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	12	I have made known what would happen . I saved you . I have told you about it . I did this . It was not some other god you worship . You are my witnesses that I am God , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	13	“ And that is not all ! I have always been God , and I always will be . No one can save people from my power . When I do something , who can undo it ? ” The Lord Is Full of Mercy but Israel Is Unfaithful
NIRV	Isaiah	43	14	The Lord sets his people free . He is the Holy One of Israel . He says , “ People of Israel , I will send an army to Babylon to save you . I will cause all the Babylonians to run away . They will try to escape in the ships they were so proud of .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	15	I am your Lord and King . I am your Holy One . I created you. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	43	16	Long ago the Lord opened a way for his people to go through the Red Sea . He made a path through the mighty waters .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	17	He caused Egypt to send out its chariots and horses . He sent its entire army to its death . Its soldiers lay down there . They never got up again . They were destroyed . They were blown out like a dimly burning flame . But the Lord says ,
NIRV	Isaiah	43	18	“ Forget the things that happened in the past . Do not keep on thinking about them .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	19	I am about to do something new . It is beginning to happen even now . Don ’ t you see it coming ? I am going to make a way for you to go through the desert . I will make streams of water in the dry and empty land .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	20	Even wild dogs and owls honor me . That is because I provide water in the desert for my people to drink . I cause streams to flow in the dry and empty land for my chosen ones .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	21	I do it for the people I made for myself . I want them to sing praise to me .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	22	“ Family of Jacob , you have not prayed to me as you should . People of Israel , you have not worn yourselves out for me .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	23	You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings . You have not honored me with your sacrifices . I have not loaded you down by requiring grain offerings . I have not made you tired by requiring you to burn incense .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	24	But you have not bought any sweet-smelling cane for me . You have not given me the fattest parts of your animal sacrifices . Instead , you have loaded me down with your sins . You have made me tired with the wrong things you have done .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	25	“ I am the one who wipes out your lawless acts . I do it because of who I am . I will not remember your sins anymore .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	26	But let us go to court together . Remind me of what you have done . State your case . Prove to me that you are not guilty .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	27	Your father Jacob sinned . The people I sent to teach you refused to obey me .
NIRV	Isaiah	43	28	So I put the high officials of your temple to shame . I let Jacob ’ s family be totally destroyed . And I let people make fun of Israel . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	44	44	“ Family of Jacob , listen to me . You are my servant . People of Israel , I have chosen you .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	2	I made you . I formed you when you were born as a nation . I will help you . So listen to what I am saying . Family of Jacob , do not be afraid . You are my servant . People of Israel , I have chosen you .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	3	I will pour out water on the thirsty land . I will make streams flow on the dry ground . I will pour out my Spirit on your children . I will pour out my blessing on their children after them .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	4	They will spring up like grass in a meadow . They will grow like poplar trees near flowing streams .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	5	Some will say , ‘ We belong to the Lord. ’ Others will call themselves by Jacob ’ s name . Still others will write on their hands , ‘ We belong to the Lord. ’ And they will be called by the name of Israel . Worship the Lord , Not False Gods
NIRV	Isaiah	44	6	“ I am Israel ’ s King . I set them free . I am the Lord who rules over all . So listen to what I am saying . I am the first and the last . I am the one and only God .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	7	Who is like me ? Let him come forward and speak boldly . Let him tell me everything that has happened since I created my people long ago . And let him tell me what has not happened yet . Let him announce ahead of time what is going to take place .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	8	Do not tremble with fear . Do not be afraid . Didn ’ t I announce everything that has happened ? Didn ’ t I tell you about it long ago ? You are my witnesses . Is there any other God but me ? No ! There is no other Rock . I do not know even one. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	44	9	Those who make statues of gods don ’ t amount to anything . And the statues they think so much of are worthless . Those who would speak up for them are blind . They don ’ t know anything . So they will be put to shame .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	10	People make statues of gods . But those gods can ’ t do any good .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	11	People who do that will be put to shame . Those who make statues of gods are mere human beings . Let all of them come together and state their case . They will be terrified and put to shame .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	12	A blacksmith gets his tool . He uses it to shape metal over the burning coals . He uses his hammers to make a statue of a god . He forms it with his powerful arm . He gets hungry and loses his strength . He doesn ’ t drink any water . He gets weaker and weaker .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	13	A carpenter measures a piece of wood with a line . He draws a pattern on it with a marker . He cuts out a statue with sharp tools . He marks it with compasses . He shapes it into the form of a beautiful human being . He does this so he can put it in a temple .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	14	He cuts down a cedar tree . Or perhaps he takes a cypress or an oak tree . It might be a tree that grew in the forest . Or it might be a pine tree he planted . And the rain made it grow .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	15	A man gets wood from trees to burn . He uses some of it to warm himself . He starts a fire and bakes bread . But he also uses some of it to make a god and worship it . He makes a statue of a god and bows down to it .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	16	He burns half of the wood in the fire . He prepares a meal over it . He cooks meat over it . He eats until he is full . He also warms himself . He says , “ Good ! I ’ m getting warm . The fire is nice and hot. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	44	17	From the rest of the wood he makes a statue . It becomes his god . He bows down and worships it . He prays to it . He says , “ Save me ! You are my god ! ”
NIRV	Isaiah	44	18	People like that don ’ t even know what they are doing . Their eyes are shut so that they can ’ t see the truth . Their minds are closed so that they can ’ t understand it .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	19	No one even stops to think about this . No one has any sense or understanding . If anyone did , they would say , “ I used half of the wood for fuel . I even baked bread over the fire . I cooked meat . Then I ate it . Should I now make a statue of a god out of the wood that ’ s left over ? Should I bow down to a block of wood ? The Lord would hate that. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	44	20	That ’ s as foolish as eating ashes ! The mind of someone like that has led him astray . He can ’ t save himself . He can ’ t bring himself to say , “ This thing I ’ m holding in my right hand isn ’ t really a god at all. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	44	21	The Lord says , “ Family of Jacob , remember these things . People of Israel , you are my servant . I have made you . You are my servant . Israel , I will not forget you .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	22	I will sweep your sins away as if they were a cloud . I will blow them away as if they were the morning mist . Return to me . Then I will set you free. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	44	23	Sing for joy , you heavens ! The Lord does wonderful things . Shout out loud , you earth ! Burst into song , you mountains ! Sing , you forests and all your trees ! The Lord sets the family of Jacob free . He shows his glory in Israel . People Will Live in Jerusalem Again
NIRV	Isaiah	44	24	The Lord says , “ People of Israel , I set you free . I formed you when you were born as a nation . “ I am the Lord . I am the Maker of everything . I alone stretch out the heavens . I spread out the earth by myself .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	25	“ Some prophets are not really prophets at all . I show that their signs are fake . I make those who practice evil magic look foolish . I destroy the learning of those who think they are wise . Their knowledge does not make any sense at all .
NIRV	Isaiah	44	26	I make the words of my servants the prophets come true . I carry out what my messengers say will happen . “ I say about Jerusalem , ‘ My people will live there again. ’ I say about the towns of Judah , ‘ They will be rebuilt. ’ I say about their broken-down buildings , ‘ I will make them like new again. ’
NIRV	Isaiah	44	27	I say to the deep waters , ‘ Dry up . Let your streams become dry. ’
NIRV	Isaiah	44	28	I say about Cyrus , ‘ He is my shepherd . He will accomplish everything I want him to . He will say about Jerusalem , “ Let it be rebuilt. ” And he will say about the temple , “ Let its foundations be laid. ” ’ Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	45	45	“ Cyrus is my anointed king . I take hold of his right hand . I give him the power to bring nations under his control . I help him strip kings of their power to go to war against him . I break city gates open so he can go through them . I say to him ,

NIRV	Isaiah	45	4	Cyrus , I am sending for you by name . I am doing it for the good of the family of Jacob . They are my servant . I am doing it for Israel . They are my chosen people . You do not know anything about me . But I am giving you a title of honor .
NIRV	Isaiah	45	5	I am the Lord . There is no other Lord . I am the one and only God . You do not know anything about me . But I will make you strong .

NIRV	Isaiah	45	9	How terrible it will be for anyone who argues with their Maker ! They are like a broken piece of pottery lying on the ground . Does clay say to a potter , “ What are you making ? ” Does a pot say , “ The potter doesn ’ t have any skill ” ?
NIRV	Isaiah	45	10	How terrible it will be for anyone who says to a father , “ Why did you give me life ? ” How terrible for anyone who says to a mother , “ Why have you brought me into the world ? ”
NIRV	Isaiah	45	11	The Lord is the Holy One of Israel . He made them . He says to them , “ Are you asking me about what will happen to my children ? Are you telling me what I should do with what my hands have made ?
NIRV	Isaiah	45	12	I made the earth . I created human beings to live there . My own hands spread out the heavens . I put all the stars in their places .
NIRV	Isaiah	45	13	I will stir up Cyrus and help him win his battles . I will make all his roads straight . He will rebuild Jerusalem . My people have been taken away from their country . But he will set them free . I will not pay him to do it . He will not receive a reward for it , ” says the Lord who rules over all .
NIRV	Isaiah	45	14	The Lord says to the people of Jerusalem , “ You will get everything Egypt produces . You will receive everything the people of Cush and the tall Sabeans get in trade . All of it will belong to you . And all these people will walk behind you as slaves . They will be put in chains and come over to you . They will bow down to you . They will admit , ‘ God is with you . There is no other God. ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	45	15	You are a God who has been hiding yourself . You are the God of Israel . You save us .
NIRV	Isaiah	45	16	All those who make statues of gods will be put to shame . They will be dishonored . They will be led away in shame together .
NIRV	Isaiah	45	17	But the Lord will save Israel . He will save them forever . They will never be put to shame or dishonored . That will be true for all time to come .
NIRV	Isaiah	45	18	The Lord created the heavens . He is God . He formed the earth and made it . He set it firmly in place . He didn ’ t create it to be empty . Instead , he formed it for people to live on . He says , “ I am the Lord . There is no other Lord .
NIRV	Isaiah	45	19	I have not spoken in secret . I have not spoken from a dark place . I have not said to Jacob ’ s people , ‘ It is useless to look for me. ’ I am the Lord . I always speak the truth . I always say what is right .
NIRV	Isaiah	45	20	“ Come together , you people of the nations who escaped from Babylon . Gather together and come into court . Only people who do not know anything would carry around gods that are made out of wood . They pray to false gods that can ’ t save them .
NIRV	Isaiah	45	21	Tell me what will happen . State your case . Talk it over together . Who spoke long ago about what would happen ? Who said it a long time ago ? I did . I am the Lord . I am the one and only God . I always do what is right . I am the one who saves . There is no God but me .

NIRV	Isaiah	46	46	The gods named Bel and Nebo are brought down in shame . The statues of them are being carried away on the backs of animals . They used to be carried around by the people who worshiped them . But now they ’ ve become a heavy load for tired animals .
NIRV	Isaiah	46	2	The gods named Bel and Nebo are brought down in shame together . They aren ’ t able to save their own statues . They themselves are carried off as prisoners .
NIRV	Isaiah	46	3	The Lord says , “ Family of Jacob , listen to me . Pay attention , you people of Israel who are left alive . I have taken good care of you since your life began . I have carried you since you were born as a nation .
NIRV	Isaiah	46	4	I will continue to carry you even when you are old . I will take good care of you even when your hair is gray . I have made you , and I will carry you . I will take care of you , and I will save you . I am the Lord .
NIRV	Isaiah	46	5	“ Who will you compare me with ? Who is equal to me ? What am I like ? Who can you compare me with ?
NIRV	Isaiah	46	6	Some people pour out gold from their bags . They weigh out silver on the scales . They hire someone who works with gold to make it into a god . They bow down to it and worship it .
NIRV	Isaiah	46	7	They lift it up on their shoulders and carry it . They set it up in its place , and there it stands . It can ’ t move from that spot . Someone might cry out to it . But it does not answer . It can ’ t save them from their troubles .
NIRV	Isaiah	46	8	So remember this , you who refuse to obey me . Keep it in your minds and hearts .
NIRV	Isaiah	46	9	“ Remember what happened in the past . Think about what took place long ago . I am God . There is no other God . I am God . There is no one like me .
NIRV	Isaiah	46	10	Before something even happens , I announce how it will end . In fact , from times long ago I announced what was still to come . I say , ‘ My plan will succeed . I will do anything I want to do. ’

NIRV	Isaiah	47	47	“ City of Babylon , go down and sit in the dust . Leave your throne and sit on the ground . Queen city of the Babylonians , your life will not be comfortable and easy anymore .
NIRV	Isaiah	47	2	Get millstones and grind some flour like a female slave . Take off your veil . Lift up your skirts . Make your legs bare . Wade through the streams .
NIRV	Isaiah	47	3	Everyone will see your naked body . Everyone will see your shame . I will pay you back for what you did . I will not spare any of your people. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	47	4	The one who sets us free is the Holy One of Israel . His name is the Lord Who Rules Over All .
NIRV	Isaiah	47	5	The Lord says , “ Queen city of the Babylonians , go into a dark prison . Sit there quietly . You will not be called the queen of kingdoms anymore .
NIRV	Isaiah	47	6	I was angry with my people . I treated them as if they did not belong to me . I handed them over to you . And you did not show them any pity . You even placed heavy loads on their old people .
NIRV	Isaiah	47	7	You said , ‘ I am queen forever ! ’ But you did not think about what you were doing . You did not consider how things might turn out .
NIRV	Isaiah	47	8	“ So listen , you who love pleasure . You think you are safe and secure . You say to yourself , ‘ I am like a god . No one is greater than I am . I ’ ll never be a widow . And my children will never be taken away from me. ’
NIRV	Isaiah	47	9	But both of these things will happen to you in a moment . They will take place on a single day . You will lose your children . And you will become a widow . That is what will happen to you . All your evil magic and powerful spells will not save you .
NIRV	Isaiah	47	10	You have felt secure in your evil ways . You have said , ‘ No one sees what I ’ m doing. ’ Your wisdom and knowledge lead you astray . You say to yourself , ‘ I am like a god . No one is greater than I am. ’
NIRV	Isaiah	47	11	So horrible trouble will come on you . You will not know how to use your evil magic to make it go away . Great trouble will fall on you . No amount of money can keep it away . Something terrible will happen to you all at once . You will not see it coming ahead of time .
NIRV	Isaiah	47	12	“ So keep on casting your magic spells . Keep on practicing your evil magic . You have been doing those things ever since you were a child . Perhaps they will help you . Maybe they will scare your enemies away .
NIRV	Isaiah	47	13	All the advice you have received has only worn you out ! Let those who study the heavens come forward . They claim to know what is going to happen by watching the stars every month . So let them save you from the trouble that is coming on you .
NIRV	Isaiah	47	14	They are just like straw . Fire will burn them up . They can ’ t even save themselves from the powerful flames . These are not like coals that can warm anyone . This is not like a fire to sit by .
NIRV	Isaiah	47	15	They can ’ t do you any good . You have done business with them ever since you were a child . You have always asked them for advice . All of them are bewildered and continue in their own ways . None of them can save you. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	48	48	People of Jacob , listen to me . You are called by the name of Israel . You come from the family line of Judah . You make promises in the name of the Lord . You pray to Israel ’ s God . But you aren ’ t honest . You don ’ t mean what you say .
NIRV	Isaiah	48	2	You call yourselves citizens of the holy city of Jerusalem . You say you depend on Israel ’ s God . His name is the Lord Who Rules Over All . He says ,
NIRV	Isaiah	48	3	“ Long ago I told you ahead of time what would happen . I announced it and made it known . Then all of a sudden I acted . And those things took place .
NIRV	Isaiah	48	4	I knew how stubborn you were . Your neck muscles were as unbending as iron . Your forehead was as hard as bronze .
NIRV	Isaiah	48	5	So I told you those things long ago . Before they happened I announced them to you . I did it so you would not be able to say , ‘ My statues of gods did them . My wooden and metal gods made them happen. ’
NIRV	Isaiah	48	6	You have heard me tell you these things . Think about all of them . Won ’ t you admit they have taken place ? “ From now on I will tell you about new things that will happen . I have not made them known to you before .
NIRV	Isaiah	48	7	These things are taking place right now . They did not happen long ago . You have not heard of them before today . So you can ’ t say , ‘ Oh , yes . I already knew about them. ’
NIRV	Isaiah	48	8	You have not heard or understood what I said . Your ears have been plugged up for a long time . I knew very well that you would turn against me . From the day you were born , you have refused to obey me .
NIRV	Isaiah	48	9	For the honor of my own name I wait to show my anger . I hold it back from you so people will continue to praise me . I do not want to destroy you completely .
NIRV	Isaiah	48	10	I have tested you in the furnace of suffering . I have tried to make you pure . But I did not use as much heat as it takes to make silver pure .
NIRV	Isaiah	48	11	I tried to purify you for my own honor . I did it for the honor of my name . How can I let myself be dishonored ? I will not give up my glory to any other god . Israel Is Set Free
NIRV	Isaiah	48	12	“ Family of Jacob , listen to me . People of Israel , pay attention . I have chosen you . I am the first and the last . I am the Lord .
NIRV	Isaiah	48	13	With my own hand I laid the foundations of the earth . With my right hand I spread out the heavens . When I send for them , they come and stand ready to obey me .
NIRV	Isaiah	48	14	“ People of Israel , come together and listen to me . What other god has said ahead of time that certain things would happen ? I have chosen Cyrus . He will carry out my plans against Babylon . He will use his power against the Babylonians .
NIRV	Isaiah	48	15	I myself have spoken . I have chosen him to carry out my purpose . I will bring him to Babylon . He will succeed in what I tell him to do .
NIRV	Isaiah	48	16	“ Come close and listen to me . “ From the first time I said Cyrus was coming , I did not do it in secret . When he comes , I will be there. ” The Lord and King has filled me with his Spirit . People of Israel , he has sent me to you .
NIRV	Isaiah	48	17	The Lord is the Holy One of Israel . He sets his people free . He says to them , “ I am the Lord your God . I teach you what is best for you . I direct you in the way you should go .
NIRV	Isaiah	48	18	I wish you would pay attention to my commands . If you did , peace would flow over you like a river . Godliness would sweep over you like the waves of the ocean .
NIRV	Isaiah	48	19	Your family would be like the sand . Your children after you would be as many as the grains of sand by the sea . It would be impossible to count them . I would always accept the members of your family line . They would never disappear or be destroyed. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	48	20	People of Israel , leave Babylon ! Hurry up and get away from the Babylonians ! Here is what I want you to announce . Make it known with shouts of joy . Send the news out from one end of the earth to the other . Say , “ The Lord has set free his servant Jacob. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	48	21	They didn ’ t get thirsty when he led them through the deserts . He made water flow out of the rock for them . He broke the rock open , and water came out of it .

NIRV	Isaiah	49	3	He said to me , “ You are my true servant Israel . I will show my glory through you. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	49	4	But I said , “ In spite of my hard work , I feel as if I haven ’ t accomplished anything . I ’ ve used up all my strength . It seems as if everything I ’ ve done is worthless . But the Lord will give me what I should receive . My God will reward me. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	49	5	The Lord formed me in my mother ’ s body to be his servant . He wanted me to bring the family of Jacob back to him . He wanted me to gather the people of Israel to himself . The Lord will honor me . My God will give me strength .
NIRV	Isaiah	49	6	Here is what the Lord says to me . “ It is not enough for you as my servant to bring the tribes of Jacob back to their land . It is not enough for you to bring back the people of Israel I have kept alive . I will also make you a light for the Gentiles . Then you will make it possible for the whole world to be saved. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	49	7	The Lord sets his people free . He is the Holy One of Israel . He speaks to his servant , who is looked down on and hated by the nations . He speaks to the servant of rulers . He says to him , “ Kings will see you and stand up to honor you . Princes will see you and bow down to show you their respect . I am the Lord . I am faithful . I am the Holy One of Israel . I have chosen you. ” Israel Is Brought Back to Their Land

NIRV	Isaiah	49	15	The Lord answers , “ Can a mother forget the baby who is nursing at her breast ? Can she stop having tender love for the child who was born to her ? She might forget her child . But I will not forget you .

NIRV	Isaiah	49	21	Then you will say to yourself , ‘ Whose children are these ? I lost my children . And I couldn ’ t have any more . My children were taken far away from me . And no one wanted them . Who brought these children up ? I was left all alone . So where have these children come from ? ’ ”
NIRV	Isaiah	49	22	The Lord and King continues , “ I will call out to the nations . I will give a signal to them . They will bring back your sons in their arms . They will carry your daughters on their hips .
NIRV	Isaiah	49	23	Their kings will become like fathers to you . Their queens will be like mothers who nurse you . They will bow down to you with their faces toward the ground . They will kiss the dust at your feet to show you their respect . Then you will know that I am the Lord . Those who put their hope in me will not be ashamed. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	49	24	Can goods that were stolen by soldiers be taken away from them ? Can prisoners be set free from the powerful Babylonians ?

NIRV	Isaiah	50	2	When I came to save you , why didn ’ t anyone welcome me ? When I called out to you , why didn ’ t anyone answer me ? Wasn ’ t I powerful enough to set you free ?

NIRV	Isaiah	53	53	Who has believed what we ’ ve been saying ? Who has seen the Lord ’ s saving power ?
NIRV	Isaiah	53	2	His servant grew up like a tender young plant . He grew like a root coming up out of dry ground . He didn ’ t have any beauty or majesty that made us notice him . There wasn ’ t anything special about the way he looked that drew us to him .
NIRV	Isaiah	53	3	People looked down on him . They didn ’ t accept him . He knew all about pain and suffering . He was like someone people turn their faces away from . We looked down on him . We didn ’ t have any respect for him .

NIRV	Isaiah	53	6	All of us are like sheep . We have wandered away from God . All of us have turned to our own way . And the Lord has placed on his servant the sins of all of us .
NIRV	Isaiah	53	7	He was treated badly and made to suffer . But he didn ’ t open his mouth . He was led away like a lamb to be killed . Sheep are silent while their wool is being cut off . In the same way , he didn ’ t open his mouth .

NIRV	Isaiah	53	9	He was given a grave with those who were evil . But his body was buried in the tomb of a rich man . He was killed even though he hadn ’ t harmed anyone . And he had never lied to anyone .
NIRV	Isaiah	53	10	The Lord says , “ It was my plan to crush him and cause him to suffer . I made his life an offering to pay for sin . But he will see all his children after him . In fact , he will continue to live . My plan will be brought about through him .
NIRV	Isaiah	53	11	After he has suffered , he will see the light of life . And he will be satisfied . My godly servant will make many people godly because of what he will accomplish . He will be punished for their sins .
NIRV	Isaiah	53	12	So I will give him a place of honor among those who are great . He will be rewarded just like others who win the battle . That ’ s because he was willing to give his life as a sacrifice . He was counted among those who had committed crimes . He took the sins of many people on himself . And he gave his life for those who had done what is wrong. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	57	6	You have chosen some of the smooth stones in the valleys to be your gods . You have joined yourselves to them . You have even poured out drink offerings to them . You have given grain offerings to them . So why should I take pity on you ?
NIRV	Isaiah	57	7	You have made your bed on a very high hill . You went up there to offer your sacrifices .
NIRV	Isaiah	57	8	You have set up statues to remind you of your gods . You have put them behind your doors and doorposts . You deserted me . You invited other lovers into your bed . You climbed into it and welcomed them . You made a deal with them . And you looked with desire at their naked bodies .
NIRV	Isaiah	57	9	You took olive oil to the god named Molek . You took a lot of perfume along with you . You sent your messengers to places far away . You even sent them down to the place of the dead .
NIRV	Isaiah	57	10	You wore yourself out with all your efforts . But you would not say , ‘ It ’ s hopeless. ’ You received new strength . So you did not give up .
NIRV	Isaiah	57	11	“ Who are you so afraid of that you have not been faithful to me ? You have not remembered me . What you do doesn ’ t even bother you . I have not punished you for a long time . That is why you are not afraid of me .
NIRV	Isaiah	57	12	You have not done what is right or good . I will let everyone know about it . And that will not be of any benefit to you .
NIRV	Isaiah	57	13	Go ahead and cry out for help to all the statues of your gods . See if they can save you ! The wind will carry them off . Just a puff of air will blow them away . But anyone who comes to me for safety will receive the land . They will possess my holy mountain of Zion. ” The Lord Comforts People Who Are Sorry for Their Sins
NIRV	Isaiah	57	14	A messenger says , “ Build up the road ! Build it up ! Get it ready ! Remove anything that would keep my people from coming back. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	57	15	The God who is highly honored lives forever . His name is holy . He says , “ I live in a high and holy place . But I also live with anyone who turns away from their sins . I live with anyone who is not proud . I give new life to them . I give it to anyone who turns away from their sins .
NIRV	Isaiah	57	16	I will not find fault with my people forever . I will not always be angry with them . If I were , I would cause their spirits to grow weak . The people I created would faint away .
NIRV	Isaiah	57	17	I was very angry with them . They always longed for more and more of everything . So I punished them for that sin . I turned my face away from them because I was angry . But they kept on wanting their own way .
NIRV	Isaiah	57	18	I have seen what they have done . But I will heal them . I will guide them . I will give those who mourn in Israel the comfort they had before .
NIRV	Isaiah	57	19	Then they will praise me . I will give perfect peace to those who are far away and those who are near . And I will heal them , ” says the Lord .
NIRV	Isaiah	57	20	But those who are evil are like the rolling sea . It never rests . Its waves toss up mud and sand .

NIRV	Isaiah	58	58	The Lord told me , “ Shout out loud . Do not hold back . Raise your voice like a trumpet . Tell my people that they have refused to obey me . Tell the family of Jacob how much they have sinned .
NIRV	Isaiah	58	2	Day after day they worship me . They seem ready and willing to know how I want them to live . They act as if they were a nation that does what is right . They act as if they have not turned away from my commands . They claim to want me to give them fair decisions . They seem ready and willing to come near and worship me .
NIRV	Isaiah	58	3	‘ We have gone without food , ’ they say . ‘ Why haven ’ t you noticed it ? We have made ourselves suffer . Why haven ’ t you paid any attention to us ? ’ “ On the day when you fast , you do as you please . You take advantage of all your workers .
NIRV	Isaiah	58	4	When you fast , it ends in arguing and fighting . You hit one another with your fists . That is an evil thing to do . The way you are now fasting keeps your prayers from being heard in heaven .
NIRV	Isaiah	58	5	Do you think that is the way I want you to fast ? Is it only a time for people to make themselves suffer ? Is it only for people to bow their heads like tall grass bent by the wind ? Is it only for people to lie down in ashes and clothes of mourning ? Is that what you call a fast ? Do you think I can accept that ?
NIRV	Isaiah	58	6	“ Here is the way I want you to fast . “ Set free those who are held by chains without any reason . Untie the ropes that hold people as slaves . Set free those who are crushed . Break every evil chain .
NIRV	Isaiah	58	7	Share your food with hungry people . Provide homeless people with a place to stay . Give naked people clothes to wear . Provide for the needs of your own family .
NIRV	Isaiah	58	8	Then the light of my blessing will shine on you like the rising sun . I will heal you quickly . I will march out ahead of you . And my glory will follow behind you and guard you . That ’ s because I always do what is right .
NIRV	Isaiah	58	9	You will call out to me for help . And I will answer you . You will cry out . And I will say , ‘ Here I am. ’ “ Get rid of the chains you use to hold others down . Stop pointing your finger at others as if they had done something wrong . Stop saying harmful things about them .
NIRV	Isaiah	58	10	Work hard to feed hungry people . Satisfy the needs of those who are crushed . Then my blessing will light up your darkness . And the night of your suffering will become as bright as the noonday sun .
NIRV	Isaiah	58	11	I will always guide you . I will satisfy your needs in a land baked by the sun . I will make you stronger . You will be like a garden that has plenty of water . You will be like a spring whose water never runs dry .
NIRV	Isaiah	58	12	Your people will rebuild the cities that were destroyed long ago . And you will build again on the old foundations . You will be called One Who Repairs Broken Walls . You will be called One Who Makes City Streets Like New Again .
NIRV	Isaiah	58	13	“ Do not work on the Sabbath day . Do not do just anything you want to on my holy day . Make the Sabbath a day you can enjoy . Honor the Lord ’ s holy day . Do not work on it . Do not do just anything you want to . Do not talk about things that are worthless .
NIRV	Isaiah	58	14	Then you will find your joy in me . I will give you control over the most important places in the land . And you will enjoy all the good things in the land I gave your father Jacob. ” The Lord has spoken . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	59	59	People of Israel , the Lord ’ s arm is not too weak to save you . His ears aren ’ t too deaf to hear your cry for help .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	2	But your sins have separated you from your God . They have caused him to turn his face away from you . So he won ’ t listen to you .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	3	Your hands and fingers are stained with blood . You are guilty of committing murder . Your mouth has told lies . Your tongue says evil things .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	4	People aren ’ t fair when they present cases in court . They aren ’ t honest when they state their case . They depend on weak arguments . They tell lies . They plan to make trouble . Then they carry it out .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	5	The plans they make are like the eggs of poisonous snakes . Anyone who eats those eggs will die . When one of them is broken , a snake comes out .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	6	Those people weave their evil plans together like a spider ’ s web . But the webs they make can ’ t be used as clothes . They can ’ t cover themselves with what they make . Their acts are evil . They do things to harm others .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	7	They are always in a hurry to sin . They run quickly to murder those who aren ’ t guilty . They love to think up evil plans . They leave a trail of harmful actions .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	8	They don ’ t know how to live at peace with others . What they do isn ’ t fair . They lead twisted lives . No one who lives like that will enjoy peace and rest .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	9	We aren ’ t being treated fairly . We haven ’ t been set free yet . The God who always does what is right hasn ’ t come to help us . We look for light , but we see nothing but darkness . We look for brightness , but we walk in deep shadows .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	10	Like blind people we feel our way along the wall . We are like those who can ’ t see . At noon we trip and fall as if the sun had already set . Compared to those who are healthy , we are like dead people .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	11	All of us growl like hungry bears . We sound like doves as we mourn . We want the Lord to do what is fair and save us . But he doesn ’ t do it . We long for him to set us free . But the time for that seems far away .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	12	That ’ s because we ’ ve done so many things he considers wrong . Our sins prove that we are guilty . The wrong things we ’ ve done are always troubling us . We admit that we have sinned .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	13	We ’ ve refused to obey the Lord . We ’ ve made evil plans against him . We ’ ve turned our backs on our God . We ’ ve stirred up conflict and refused to follow him . We ’ ve told lies that came from our own minds .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	14	So people stop others from doing what is fair . They keep them from doing what is right . No one tells the truth in court anymore . No one is honest there .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	15	In fact , truth can ’ t be found anywhere . Those who refuse to do evil are attacked . The Lord sees that people aren ’ t treating others fairly . That makes him unhappy .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	16	He sees that there is no one who helps his people . He is shocked that no one stands up for them . So he will use his own powerful arm to save them . He has the strength to do it because he is holy .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	17	He will put the armor of holiness on his chest . He ’ ll put the helmet of salvation on his head . He ’ ll pay people back for the wrong things they do . He ’ ll wrap himself in anger as if it were a coat .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	18	He will pay his enemies back for what they have done . He ’ ll pour his anger out on them . He ’ ll punish those who attack him . He ’ ll give the people in the islands what they have coming to them .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	19	People in the west will show respect for the Lord ’ s name . People in the east will worship him because of his glory . The Lord will come like a rushing river that was held back . His breath will drive it along .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	20	“ I set my people free . I will come to Mount Zion . I will come to those in Jacob ’ s family who turn away from their sins , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Isaiah	59	21	“ Here is the covenant I will make with them , ” says the Lord . “ My Spirit is on you and will not leave you . I have put my words in your mouth . They will never leave your mouth . And they will never leave the mouths of your children or their children after them . That will be true for all time to come , ” says the Lord . Copyright ©

Your children are bringing their silver and gold with them . They are coming to honor me . I am the Lord your God . I am the Holy One of Israel . I have honored you .
NIRV	Isaiah	60	10	“ People from other lands will rebuild your walls . Their kings will serve you . When I was angry with you , I struck you . But now I will show you my tender love .
NIRV	Isaiah	60	11	Your gates will always stand open . They will never be shut , day or night . Then people can bring you the wealth of the nations . Their kings will come along with them .
NIRV	Isaiah	60	12	The nation or kingdom that will not serve you will be destroyed . It will be completely wiped out .
NIRV	Isaiah	60	13	“ Lebanon ’ s glorious trees will be brought to you . Its junipers , firs and cypress trees will be brought . They will be used to make my temple beautiful . And I will bring glory to the place where my throne is .
NIRV	Isaiah	60	14	The children of those who crush you will come and bow down to you . All those who hate you will kneel down at your feet . Jerusalem , they will call you the City of the Lord . They will name you Zion , the City of the Holy One of Israel .
NIRV	Isaiah	60	15	“ You have been deserted and hated . No one even travels through you . But I will make you into something to be proud of forever . You will be a place of joy for all time to come .
NIRV	Isaiah	60	16	You will get everything you need from kings and nations . You will be like children who are nursing at their mother ’ s breasts . Then you will know that I am the one who saves you . I am the Lord . I set you free . I am the Mighty One of Jacob .
NIRV	Isaiah	60	17	Instead of bronze I will bring you gold . In place of iron I will give you silver . Instead of wood I will bring you bronze . In place of stones I will give you iron . I will make peace govern you . I will make godliness rule over you .
NIRV	Isaiah	60	18	People will no longer harm one another in your land . They will not wipe out or destroy anything inside your borders . You will call your walls Salvation . And you will name your gates Praise .
NIRV	Isaiah	60	19	You will not need the light of the sun by day anymore . The bright light of the moon will no longer have to shine on you . I will be your light forever . My glory will shine on you . I am the Lord your God .
NIRV	Isaiah	60	20	Your sun will never set again . Your moon will never lose its light . I will be your light forever . Your days of sorrow will come to an end .
NIRV	Isaiah	60	21	Then all your people will do what is right . The land will belong to them forever . They will be like a young tree I have planted . My hands have created them . They will show how glorious I am .

NIRV	Isaiah	61	61	The Spirit of the Lord and King is on me . The Lord has anointed me to announce good news to poor people . He has sent me to comfort those whose hearts have been broken . He has sent me to announce freedom for those who have been captured . He wants me to set prisoners free from their dark cells .

NIRV	Isaiah	61	3	He wants me to help those in Zion who are filled with sorrow . I will put beautiful crowns on their heads in place of ashes . I will anoint them with olive oil to give them joy instead of sorrow . I will give them a spirit of praise in place of a spirit of sadness . They will be like oak trees that are strong and straight . The Lord himself will plant them in the land . That will show how glorious he is .

NIRV	Isaiah	63	63	Who is this man coming from the city of Bozrah in Edom ? His clothes are stained bright red . Who is he ? He is dressed up in all his glory . He is marching toward us with great strength . The Lord answers , “ It is I. I have won the battle . I am mighty . I have saved my people. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	63	2	Why are your clothes red ? They look as if you have been stomping on grapes in a winepress .
NIRV	Isaiah	63	3	The Lord answers , “ I have been stomping on the nations as if they were grapes . No one was there to help me . I walked all over the nations because I was angry . That is why I stomped on them . Their blood splashed all over my clothes . So my clothes were stained bright red .
NIRV	Isaiah	63	4	I decided it was time to pay back Israel ’ s enemies . The year for me to set my people free had come .
NIRV	Isaiah	63	5	I looked around , but no one was there to help me . I was shocked that no one gave me any help . So I used my own power to save my people . I had the strength to do it because I was angry .
NIRV	Isaiah	63	6	I walked all over the nations because I was angry with them . I made them drink from the cup of my great anger . I poured out their blood on the ground. ” Isaiah Praises the Lord and Prays to Him
NIRV	Isaiah	63	7	I will talk about the kind things the Lord has done . I ’ ll praise him for everything he ’ s done for us . He has done many good things for the nation of Israel . That ’ s because he loves us and is very kind to us .
NIRV	Isaiah	63	8	In the past he said , “ They are my people . They are children who will be faithful to me. ” So he saved them .
NIRV	Isaiah	63	9	When they suffered , he suffered with them . He sent his angel to save them . He set them free because he is loving and kind . He lifted them up and carried them . He did it again and again in days long ago .
NIRV	Isaiah	63	10	But they refused to obey him . They made his Holy Spirit sad . So he turned against them and became their enemy . He himself fought against them .
NIRV	Isaiah	63	11	Then his people remembered what he did long ago . They recalled the days of Moses and his people . They asked , “ Where is the God who brought Israel through the Red Sea ? Moses led them as the shepherd of his flock . Where is the God who put his Holy Spirit among them ?
NIRV	Isaiah	63	12	He used his glorious and powerful arm to help Moses . He parted the waters of the sea in front of them . That mighty act made him famous forever .
NIRV	Isaiah	63	13	He led them through that deep sea . Like a horse in open country , they didn ’ t trip and fall .
NIRV	Isaiah	63	14	They were like cattle that are taken down to the plains . They were given rest by the Spirit of the Lord. ” That ’ s how he guided his people . So he made a glorious name for himself .
NIRV	Isaiah	63	15	Lord , look down from heaven . Look down from your holy and glorious throne . Where is your great love for us ? Where is your power ? Why don ’ t you show us your tender love and concern ?
NIRV	Isaiah	63	16	You are our Father . Abraham might not accept us as his children . Jacob might not recognize us as his family . But you are our Father , Lord . Your name is One Who Always Sets Us Free .
NIRV	Isaiah	63	17	Lord , why do you let us wander away from you ? Why do you let us become so stubborn that we don ’ t respect you ? Come back and help us . We are the tribes that belong to you .
NIRV	Isaiah	63	18	For a little while your holy people possessed the land . But now our enemies have torn your temple down .

NIRV	Isaiah	64	64	I wish you would open up your heavens and come down to us ! I wish the mountains would tremble when you show your power !
NIRV	Isaiah	64	2	Be like a fire that causes twigs to burn . It also makes water boil . So come down and make yourself known to your enemies . Cause the nations to shake with fear when they see your power !
NIRV	Isaiah	64	3	Long ago you did some wonderful things we didn ’ t expect . You came down , and the mountains trembled when you showed your power .
NIRV	Isaiah	64	4	No one ’ s ears have ever heard of a God like you . No one ’ s eyes have ever seen a God who is greater than you . No God but you acts for the good of those who trust in him .

NIRV	Isaiah	64	6	All of us have become like someone who is “ unclean. ” All the good things we do are like dirty rags to you . All of us are like leaves that have dried up . Our sins sweep us away like the wind .

NIRV	Isaiah	64	8	Lord , you are our Father . We are the clay . You are the potter . Your hands made all of us .
NIRV	Isaiah	64	9	Don ’ t be so angry with us , Lord . Don ’ t remember our sins anymore . Please have mercy on us . All of us belong to you .
NIRV	Isaiah	64	10	Your sacred cities have become a desert . Even Zion is a desert . Jerusalem is a dry and empty place .
NIRV	Isaiah	64	11	Our people of long ago used to praise you in our holy and glorious temple . But now it has been burned down . Everything we treasured has been destroyed .

NIRV	Isaiah	65	65	The Lord says , “ I made myself known to those who were not asking for me . I was found by those who were not trying to find me . I spoke to a nation that did not pray to me . ‘ Here I am , ’ I said . ‘ Here I am. ’
NIRV	Isaiah	65	2	All day long I have held out my hands to welcome a stubborn nation . They lead sinful lives . They go where their evil thoughts take them .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	3	They are always making me very angry . They do it right in front of me . They offer sacrifices in the gardens of other gods . They burn incense on altars that are made out of bricks .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	4	They sit among the graves . They spend their nights talking to the spirits of the dead . They eat the meat of pigs . Their cooking pots hold soup that has ‘ unclean ’ meat in it .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	5	They say , ‘ Keep away ! Don ’ t come near us ! We are too sacred for you ! ’ Those people are like smoke in my nose . They are like a fire that keeps burning all day .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	6	“ I will judge them . I have even written it down . I will not keep silent . Instead , I will pay them back for all their sins .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	7	I will punish them for their sins . I will also punish them for the sins of their people before them. ” This is what the Lord says . “ They burned sacrifices on the mountains . They disobeyed me by worshiping other gods on the hills . So I will make sure they are fully punished for all the sins they have committed. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	65	8	The Lord says , “ Sometimes juice is still left in grapes that have been crushed . So people say , ‘ Don ’ t destroy them . They are still of some benefit. ’ That is what I will do for the good of those who serve me . I will not destroy all my people .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	9	I will give children to the families of Jacob and Judah . They will possess my entire land . My chosen people will be given all of it . Those who serve me will live there .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	10	Their flocks will eat in the rich grasslands of Sharon . Their herds will rest in the Valley of Achor . That is what I will do for my people who follow me .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	11	“ But some of you have deserted me . You no longer worship on my holy mountain of Zion . You spread a table for the god called Good Fortune . You offer bowls of mixed wine to the god named Fate .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	12	So I will make it your fate to be killed by swords . All of you will die in the battle . That ’ s because I called out to you , but you did not answer me . I spoke to you , but you did not listen . You did what is evil in my sight . You chose to do what does not please me. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	65	13	So the Lord and King says , “ Those who serve me will have food to eat . But you will be hungry . My servants will have plenty to drink . But you will be thirsty . Those who serve me will be full of joy . But you will be put to shame .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	14	My servants will sing with joy in their hearts . But you will cry out because of the great pain in your hearts . You will cry because your spirits are sad .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	15	My chosen ones will use your names when they curse others . I am your Lord and King . I will put you to death . But I will give new names to those who serve me .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	16	They will ask me to bless their land . They will do it in my name . I am the one true God . They will make promises in their land . They will do it in my name . I am the one true God . The troubles of the past will be forgotten . They will be hidden from my eyes . The Lord Will Create New Heavens and a New Earth
NIRV	Isaiah	65	17	“ I will create new heavens and a new earth . The things that have happened before will not be remembered . They will not even enter your minds .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	18	So be glad and full of joy forever because of what I will create . I will cause others to take delight in Jerusalem . They will be filled with joy when they see its people .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	19	And I will be full of joy because of Jerusalem . I will take delight in my people . Weeping and crying will not be heard there anymore .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	20	“ Babies in Jerusalem will no longer live only a few days . Old people will not fail to live for a very long time . Those who live to the age of
NIRV	Isaiah	65	100	will be considered as having been under God ’ s curse .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	21	My people will build houses and live in them . They will plant vineyards and eat their fruit .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	22	They will no longer build houses only to have others live in them . They will no longer plant crops only to have others eat them . My people will live to be as old as trees . My chosen ones will enjoy for a long time the things they have worked for .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	23	Their work will not be worthless anymore . They will not have children who are sure to face sudden terror . Instead , I will bless them . I will also bless their children after them .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	24	Even before they call out to me , I will answer them . While they are still speaking , I will hear them .
NIRV	Isaiah	65	25	Wolves and lambs will eat together . Lions will eat straw like oxen . Serpents will eat nothing but dust . None of those animals will harm or destroy anything or anyone on my holy mountain of Zion , ” says the Lord . Copyright ©

NIRV	Isaiah	66	66	The Lord says , “ Heaven is my throne . The earth is under my control . So how could you ever build a house for me ? Where would my resting place be ?
NIRV	Isaiah	66	2	Didn ’ t I make everything by my power ? That is how all things were created , ” announces the Lord . “ The people I value are not proud . They are sorry for the wrong things they have done . They have great respect for what I say .
NIRV	Isaiah	66	3	But others are not like that . They sacrifice bulls to me , but at the same time they kill people . They offer lambs to me , but they also sacrifice dogs to other gods . They bring grain offerings to me , but they also offer pig ’ s blood to other gods . They burn incense to me , but they also worship statues of gods . They have chosen to go their own way . They take delight in things I hate .
NIRV	Isaiah	66	4	So I have also made a choice . I will make them suffer greatly . I will bring on them what they are afraid of . When I called out to them , no one answered me . When I spoke to them , no one listened . They did what is evil in my sight . They chose to do what displeases me. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	66	5	Listen to the word of the Lord . Listen , you who tremble with fear when he speaks . He says , “ Some of your own people hate you . They turn their backs on you because you are faithful to me . They make fun of you and say , ‘ Let the Lord show his glory by saving you . Then we can see how happy you are. ’ But they will be put to shame .
NIRV	Isaiah	66	6	Hear the loud sounds coming from the city ! Listen to the noise coming from the temple ! I am the one causing it . I am paying back my enemies for everything they have done .
NIRV	Isaiah	66	7	“ Zion is like a woman who has a baby before she goes into labor . She has a son even before her labor pains begin .
NIRV	Isaiah	66	8	Who has ever heard of anything like that ? Who has ever seen such a thing ? Can a country be born in a day ? Can a nation be created in a moment ? But as soon as Zion goes into labor , there are many more of her people .
NIRV	Isaiah	66	9	Zion , would I bring you to the moment of birth and not let it happen ? ” says the Lord . “ Would I close up a mother ’ s body when it is time for her baby to be born ? ” says your God .
NIRV	Isaiah	66	10	“ Be glad along with Jerusalem , all you who love her . Be filled with joy because of her . Take great delight in her , all you who mourn over her .
NIRV	Isaiah	66	11	You will nurse at her comforting breasts . And you will be satisfied . You will drink until you are full . And you will delight in her rich and plentiful supply. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	66	12	The Lord continues , “ I will cause peace to flow over her like a river . I will make the wealth of nations sweep over her like a flooding stream . You will nurse and be carried in her arms . You will play on her lap .
NIRV	Isaiah	66	13	As a mother comforts her child , I will comfort you . You will find comfort in Jerusalem. ”
NIRV	Isaiah	66	14	When you see that happen , your hearts will be filled with joy . Just as grass grows quickly , you will succeed . The Lord will show his power to those who serve him . But he will pour out his anger on his enemies .
NIRV	Isaiah	66	15	The Lord will judge them with fire . His chariots are coming like a windstorm . He will pour out his burning anger on his enemies . It will blaze out like flames of fire .
NIRV	Isaiah	66	16	The Lord will judge with fire and with his sword . He will judge all people . He will put many people to death .
NIRV	Isaiah	66	17	“ Some people set themselves apart and make themselves pure . They do it so they can go into the gardens to worship other gods . They follow what the worship leader tells them to do . They are among those who eat the meat of pigs and rats . They also eat other ‘ unclean ’ things . Those people and the one they follow will come to a horrible end , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Isaiah	66	18	“ They have planned to do many evil things . And they have carried out their plans . So I will come and gather the people of every nation and language . They will see my glory when I act .
NIRV	Isaiah	66	19	“ I will give them a sign . I will send to the nations some of those who are left alive . I will send some of them to the people of Tarshish , Libya and Lydia , who are famous for using bows . I will send others to Tubal and Greece . And I will send still others to islands far away . The people who live there have not heard about my fame . They have not seen my glory . But when I act , those I send will tell the nations about my glory .
NIRV	Isaiah	66	20	And they will bring back all the people of Israel from all those nations . They will bring them to my holy mountain in Jerusalem . My people will ride on horses , mules and camels . They will come in chariots and wagons , ” says the Lord . “ Those messengers will bring my people as an offering to me . They will bring them to my temple , just as the Israelites bring their grain offerings in bowls that are ‘ clean. ’
NIRV	Isaiah	66	21	And I will choose some of them to be priests and Levites , ” says the Lord .
NIRV	Isaiah	66	22	“ I will make new heavens and a new earth . And they will last forever , ” announces the Lord . “ In the same way , your name and your children after you will last forever .

NIRV	Jeremiah	1	1	These are the words Jeremiah received from the Lord . Jeremiah was the son of Hilkiah . Jeremiah was one of the priests at Anathoth . That ’ s a town in the territory of Benjamin .
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	2	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . It came in the 13th year that Josiah was king over Judah . Josiah was the son of Amon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	3	After Josiah , his son Jehoiakim was king over Judah . The Lord ’ s message also came to Jeremiah during the whole time Jehoiakim ruled . The Lord continued to speak to Jeremiah while Zedekiah was king over Judah . He did this until the fifth month of the 11th year of Zedekiah ’ s rule . That ’ s when the people of Jerusalem were forced to leave their country . Zedekiah was the son of Josiah . Here is what Jeremiah said . The Lord Appoints Jeremiah to Speak for Him
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	4	A message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	5	“ Before I formed you in your mother ’ s body I chose you . Before you were born I set you apart to serve me . I appointed you to be a prophet to the nations. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	6	“ You are my Lord and King , ” I said . “ I don ’ t know how to speak . I ’ m too young. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	7	But the Lord said to me , “ Do not say , ‘ I ’ m too young. ’ You must go to everyone I send you to . You must say everything I command you to say .
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	8	Do not be afraid of the people I send you to . I am with you . I will save you , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	9	Then the Lord reached out his hand . He touched my mouth and spoke to me . He said , “ I have put my words in your mouth .
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	10	Today I am appointing you to speak to nations and kingdoms . I give you authority to pull them up by the roots and tear them down . I give you authority to destroy them and crush them . I give you authority to build them up and plant them. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	11	A message from the Lord came to me . The Lord asked me , “ What do you see , Jeremiah ? ” “ The branch of an almond tree , ” I replied .
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	12	The Lord said to me , “ You have seen correctly . I am watching to see that my word comes true. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	13	Another message from the Lord came to me . The Lord asked me , “ What do you see ? ” “ A pot that has boiling water in it , ” I answered . “ It ’ s leaning toward us from the north. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	14	The Lord said to me , “ Something very bad will be poured out on everyone who lives in this land . It will come from the north .
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	15	I am about to send for all the armies in the northern kingdoms , ” announces the Lord . “ Their kings will come to Jerusalem . They will set up their thrones at the very gates of the city . They will attack all the walls that surround the city . They will go to war against all the towns of Judah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	16	I will judge my people . They have done many evil things . They have deserted me . They have burned incense to other gods . They have worshiped the gods their own hands have made .
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	17	“ So get ready ! Stand up ! Tell them everything I command you to . Do not let them terrify you . If you do , I will terrify you in front of them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	18	Today I have made you like a city that has a high wall around it . I have made you like an iron pillar and a bronze wall . Now you can stand up against the whole land . You can stand against the kings and officials of Judah . You can stand against its priests and its people .
NIRV	Jeremiah	1	19	They will fight against you . But they will not win the battle over you . I am with you . I will save you , ” announces the Lord . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	2	2	“ Go . Announce my message to the people in Jerusalem . I want everyone to hear it . Tell them , “ Here is what the Lord says . “ ‘ I remember how faithful you were to me when you were young . You loved me as if you were my bride . You followed me through the desert . Nothing had been planted there .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	3	Your people were holy to me . They were the first share of my harvest . All those who destroyed them were held guilty . And trouble came to their enemies , ’ ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	4	People of Jacob , hear the Lord ’ s message . Listen , all you tribes of Israel .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	5	The Lord says , “ What did your people of long ago find wrong with me ? Why did they wander so far away from me ? They worshiped worthless statues of gods . Then they themselves became worthless .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	6	They did not ask , ‘ Where is the Lord ? He brought us up out of Egypt . He led us through a dry and empty land . He guided us through deserts and deep valleys . It was a land of total darkness where there wasn ’ t any rain . No one lived or traveled there. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	7	But I brought you into a land that has rich soil . I gave you its fruit and its finest food . In spite of that , you made my land impure . You turned it into something I hate .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	8	The priests did not ask , ‘ Where is the Lord ? ’ Those who taught my law did not know me . The leaders refused to obey me . The prophets prophesied in the name of Baal . They worshiped worthless statues of gods .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	9	“ So I am bringing charges against you again , ” announces the Lord . “ And I will bring charges against your children ’ s children .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	10	Go over to the coasts of Cyprus and look . Send people to the land of Kedar and have them look closely . See if there has ever been anything like this .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	11	Has a nation ever changed its gods ? Actually , they are not even gods at all . But my people have traded away their glorious God . They have traded me for worthless statues of gods .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	12	Sky above , be shocked over this . Tremble with horror , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	13	“ My people have sinned twice . They have deserted me , even though I am the spring of water that gives life . And they have dug their own wells . But those wells are broken . They can ’ t hold any water .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	14	Are you people of Israel servants ? You were not born as slaves , were you ? Then why have you been carried off like stolen goods ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	15	Lions have roared . They have growled at you . They have destroyed your land . Your towns are burned and deserted .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	16	The men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have cracked your skulls .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	17	Haven ’ t you brought this on yourselves ? I am the Lord your God , but you deserted me . You left me even while I was leading you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	18	Why do you go to Egypt to drink water from the Nile River ? Why do you go to Assyria to drink from the Euphrates River ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	19	You will be punished because you have sinned . You will be corrected for turning away from me . I am the Lord your God . If you desert me , bad things will happen to you . If you do not respect me , you will suffer bitterly . I want you to understand that , ” announces the Lord who rules over all .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	20	“ Long ago you broke off the yoke I put on you . You tore off the ropes I tied you up with . You said , ‘ I won ’ t serve you ! ’ In fact , on every high hill you lay down like a prostitute . You worshiped other gods under every green tree .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	21	You were like a good vine when I planted you . You were a healthy plant . Then how did you turn against me ? How did you become a bad , wild vine ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	22	You might wash yourself with soap . You might use plenty of strong soap . But I can still see the stains your guilt covers you with , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	23	“ You say , ‘ I am “ clean. ” I haven ’ t followed the gods that are named Baal. ’ How can you say that ? Remember how you acted in the valley . Consider what you have done . You are like a female camel running quickly here and there .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	24	You are like a wild donkey that lives in the desert . She smells the wind when she longs for a mate . Who can hold her back ? The males that run after her do not need to wear themselves out . At mating time they will easily find her .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	25	Do not run after other gods until your sandals are worn out and your throat is dry . But you said , ‘ It ’ s no use ! I love those gods . I must go after them. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	26	“ A thief is dishonored when he is caught . And you people of Israel are filled with shame . Your kings and officials are dishonored . So are your priests and your prophets .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	27	You say to a piece of wood , ‘ You are my father. ’ You say to a stone , ‘ You are my mother. ’ You have turned your backs to me . You refuse to look at me . But when you are in trouble , you say , ‘ Come and save us ! ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	28	Then where are the gods you made for yourselves ? Let them come when you are in trouble ! Let them save you if they can ! Judah , you have as many gods as you have towns .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	29	“ Why do you bring charges against me ? All of you have refused to obey me , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	30	“ I punished your people . But it did not do them any good . They did not pay attention when they were corrected . You have killed your prophets by swords . You have swallowed them up like a hungry lion .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	31	“ You who are now living , consider my message . I am saying , “ Have I been like a desert to Israel ? Have I been like a land of deep darkness ? Why do my people say , ‘ We are free to wander . We won ’ t come to you anymore ’ ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	32	Does a young woman forget all about her jewelry ? Does a bride forget her wedding jewels ? But my people have forgotten me more days than anyone can count .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	33	You are very skilled at chasing after love ! Even the worst of women can learn from how you act .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	34	The blood of those you have killed is on your clothes . You have destroyed poor people who were not guilty . You did not catch them in the act of breaking in . In spite of all this ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	35	you say , ‘ I ’ m not guilty of doing anything wrong . The Lord isn ’ t angry with me. ’ But I will judge you . That ’ s because you say , ‘ I haven ’ t sinned. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	36	Why do you keep on changing your ways so much ? Assyria did not help you . And Egypt will not help you either .
NIRV	Jeremiah	2	37	So you will also leave Egypt with your hands tied together above your heads . I have turned my back on those you trust . They will not help you . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	3	3	So I have held back the showers . I have kept the spring rains from falling . But you still have the bold face of a prostitute . You refuse to blush with shame .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	2	“ Look up at the bare hilltops . Is there any place where you have not worshiped other gods ? You have been unfaithful to me like a wife committing adultery . By the side of the road you sat waiting for lovers . You sat there like someone who wanders in the desert . You have made the land impure . You are like a sinful prostitute .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	4	You have just now called out to me . You said , ‘ My Father , you have been my friend ever since I was young .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	5	Will you always be angry with me ? Will your anger continue forever ? ’ This is how you talk . But you do all the evil things you can. ” Israel Is Not Faithful to the Lord
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	6	During the time Josiah was king , the Lord spoke to me . He said , “ Have you seen what the people of Israel have done ? They have not been faithful to me . They have committed adultery with other gods . They worshiped them on every high hill and under every green tree .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	7	I thought that after they had done all this , they would return to me . But they did not . Their sister nation Judah saw them doing this . And they were not faithful to me either .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	8	I gave Israel their letter of divorce . I sent them away because they were unfaithful to me so many times . But I saw that their sister nation Judah did not have any respect for me . They were not faithful to me either . They also went out and committed adultery with other gods .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	9	Israel was not faithful to me , but that did not bother them at all . They made the land ‘ unclean. ’ They worshiped gods that were made out of stone and wood .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	10	In spite of all this , their sister nation Judah did not come back to me . They were not faithful to me either . They did not return with all their heart . They only pretended to , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	11	The Lord said to me , “ Israel and Judah have not been faithful to me . But Israel was not as bad as Judah was .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	12	Go . Announce this message to the people in the north . Tell them , “ ‘ Israel , you have not been faithful , ’ announces the Lord . ‘ Return to me . Then I will do good things for you again . That ’ s because I am faithful , ’ announces the Lord . ‘ I will not be angry with you forever .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	13	Admit that you are guilty of doing what is wrong . You have refused to obey me . I am the Lord your God . You have committed adultery with other gods . You worshiped them under every green tree . And you have not obeyed me , ’ ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	14	“ You people have not been faithful , ” announces the Lord . “ Return to me . I am your husband . I will choose one of you from each town . I will choose two from each territory . And I will bring you to the city of Zion .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	15	Then I will give you shepherds who are dear to my heart . Their knowledge and understanding will help them lead you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	16	In those days there will be many more of you in the land , ” announces the Lord . “ Then people will not talk about the ark of the covenant of the Lord anymore . It will never enter their minds . They will not remember it . The ark will not be missed . And another one will not be made .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	17	At that time they will call Jerusalem The Throne of the Lord . All the nations will gather together there . They will go there to honor me . They will no longer do what their stubborn and evil hearts want them to do .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	18	In those days the people of Judah will join the people of Israel . Together they will come from a land in the north . They will come to the land I gave to your people of long ago . I wanted them to have it as their very own .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	19	“ I myself said , “ ‘ I would gladly treat you like my children . I would give you a pleasant land . It is the most beautiful land any nation could have. ’ I thought you would call me ‘ Father. ’ I hoped you would always obey me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	20	But you people are like a woman who is not faithful to her husband . Israel , you have not been faithful to me , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	21	A cry is heard on the bare hilltops . The people of Israel are weeping and begging for help . That ’ s because their lives are so twisted . They ’ ve forgotten the Lord their God .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	22	“ You have not been faithful , ” says the Lord . “ Return to me . I will heal you . Then you will not turn away from me anymore. ” “ Yes , ” the people say . “ We will come to you . You are the Lord our God .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	23	The gods we worship on the hills and mountains are useless . You are the Lord our God . You are the only one who can save us .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	24	From our earliest years shameful gods have harmed us . They have eaten up everything our people of long ago worked for . They have eaten up our flocks and herds . They ’ ve destroyed our sons and daughters .
NIRV	Jeremiah	3	25	Let us lie down in our shame . Let our dishonor cover us . You are the Lord our God . But we have sinned against you . We and our people of long ago have sinned . We haven ’ t obeyed you from our earliest years until now. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	4	4	People of Judah and you who live in Jerusalem , obey me . Do not let your hearts be stubborn . If you do , my anger will blaze out against you . It will burn like fire because of the evil things you have done . No one will be able to put it out . Trouble Will Come From the North
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	2	Make all your promises in my name . When you promise say , ‘ You can be sure that the Lord is alive. ’ Be truthful , fair and honest when you make these promises . Then the nations will ask for blessings from me . And they will boast about me. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	3	Here is what the Lord is telling the people of Judah and Jerusalem . He says , “ Your hearts are as hard as a field that has not been plowed . So change your ways and produce good crops . Do not plant seeds among thorns .
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	5	“ Announce my message in Judah . Tell it in Jerusalem . Say , ‘ Blow trumpets all through the land ! ’ Give a loud shout and say , ‘ Gather together ! Let ’ s run to cities that have high walls around them ! ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	6	Warn everyone to go to Zion ! Run for safety ! Do not wait ! I am bringing trouble from the north . Everything will be totally destroyed. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	7	Lions have come out of their dens . Those who destroy nations have begun to march out . They have left their place to destroy your land completely . Your towns will be broken to pieces . No one will live in them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	8	So put on the clothes of sadness . Mourn and weep over what has happened . The Lord hasn ’ t turned his great anger away from us .
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	9	“ A dark day is coming , ” announces the Lord . “ The king and his officials will lose hope . The priests will be shocked . And the prophets will be terrified. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	10	Then I said , “ You are my Lord and King . You have completely tricked the people of Judah and Jerusalem ! You have told them , ‘ You will have peace and rest. ’ But swords are pointed at our throats ! ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	11	At that time the people of Judah and Jerusalem will be warned . They will be told , “ A hot and dry wind is coming , my people . It is blowing toward you from the bare hilltops in the desert . But it does not separate straw from grain .
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	12	It is much too strong for that . The wind is coming from me . I am making my decision against you. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	13	Look ! Our enemies are approaching like the clouds . Their chariots are coming like a strong wind . Their horses are faster than eagles . How terrible it will be for us ! We ’ ll be destroyed !
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	14	People of Jerusalem , wash your sins from your hearts and be saved . How long will you hold on to your evil thoughts ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	15	A voice is speaking all the way from the city of Dan . From the hills of Ephraim it announces that trouble is coming .
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	16	“ Tell the nations . Make an announcement concerning Jerusalem . Say , ‘ An army will attack Judah . It is coming from a land far away . It will shout a war cry against the cities of Judah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	17	It will surround them like people who guard a field . Judah has refused to obey me , ’ ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	18	“ The army will attack you because of your conduct and actions . This is how you will be punished . It will be so bitter ! It will cut deep down into your hearts ! ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	19	I ’ m suffering ! I ’ m really suffering ! I ’ m hurting badly . My heart is suffering so much ! It ’ s pounding inside me . I can ’ t keep silent . I ’ ve heard the sound of trumpets . I ’ ve heard the battle cry .
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	20	One trouble follows another . The whole land is destroyed . In an instant my tents are gone . My home disappears in a moment .
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	21	How long must I look at our enemy ’ s battle flag ? How long must I hear the sound of the trumpets ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	22	The Lord says , “ My people are foolish . They do not know me . They are children who do not have any sense . They have no understanding at all . They are skilled in doing what is evil . They do not know how to do what is good. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	23	I looked at the earth . It didn ’ t have any shape . And it was empty . I looked at the sky . Its light was gone .
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	24	I looked at the mountains . They were shaking . All the hills were swaying .
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	25	I looked . And there weren ’ t any people . Every bird in the sky had flown away .
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	26	I looked . And the fruitful land had become a desert . All its towns were destroyed . The Lord had done all this because of his great anger .
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	27	The Lord says , “ The whole land will be destroyed . But I will not destroy it completely .
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	28	So the earth will be filled with sadness . The sky above will grow dark . I have spoken , and I will not take pity on them . I have made my decision , and I will not change my mind. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	29	People can hear the sound of horsemen . Men armed with bows are coming . The people in every town run away . Some of them go into the bushes . Others climb up among the rocks . All the towns are deserted . No one is living in them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	30	What are you doing , you who are destroyed ? Why do you dress yourself in bright red clothes ? Why do you put on jewels of gold ? Why do you put makeup on your eyes ? You make yourself beautiful for no reason at all . Your lovers hate you . They want to kill you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	4	31	I hear a cry like the cry of a woman having a baby . I hear a groan like someone having her first child . It ’ s the cry of the people of Zion struggling to breathe . They reach out their hands and say , “ Help us ! We ’ re fainting ! Murderers are about to kill us ! ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	5	5	So I will go to the leaders . I ’ ll speak to them . They should know how the Lord wants them to live . They must know what their God requires of them. ” But all of them had broken off the yoke the Lord had put on them . They had torn off the ropes he had tied them up with .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	2	They make their promises in my name . They say , ‘ You can be sure that the Lord is alive. ’ But their promises can ’ t be trusted. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	3	Lord , don ’ t your eyes look for truth ? You struck down your people . But they didn ’ t feel any pain . You crushed them . But they refused to be corrected . They made their faces harder than stone . They refused to turn away from their sins .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	4	I thought , “ The people of Jerusalem are foolish . They don ’ t know how the Lord wants them to live . They don ’ t know what their God requires of them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	6	So a lion from the forest will attack them . A wolf from the desert will destroy them . A leopard will hide and wait near their towns . It will tear to pieces anyone who dares to go out . Again and again they have refused to obey the Lord . They have turned away from him many times .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	7	The Lord says , “ Jerusalem , why should I forgive you ? Your people have deserted me . They have made their promises in the names of gods that are not really gods at all . I supplied everything they needed . But they committed adultery . Large crowds went to the houses of prostitutes .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	8	Your people are like stallions that have plenty to eat . Their sinful desires are out of control . Each of them goes after another man ’ s wife .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	9	Shouldn ’ t I punish them for this ? ” announces the Lord . “ Shouldn ’ t I pay back the nation that does these things ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	10	“ Armies of Babylon , go through their vineyards and destroy them . But do not destroy them completely . Strip off their branches . These people do not belong to me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	11	The people of Israel and the people of Judah have not been faithful to me at all , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	12	They have told lies about the Lord . They said , “ He won ’ t do anything ! No harm will come to us . We will never see war or be hungry .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	13	The prophets are nothing but wind . Their message doesn ’ t come from the Lord . So let what they say will happen be done to them. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	14	The Lord God rules over all . He says to me , “ The people have spoken these words . So my words will be like fire in your mouth . I will make the people like wood . And the fire will burn them up. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	15	“ People of Israel , listen to me , ” announces the Lord . “ I am bringing against you a nation from far away . It is an old nation . And it will last for a long time . Its people speak a language you do not know . You can ’ t understand what they are saying .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	16	The bags they carry their arrows in are like an open grave . All their soldiers are mighty .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	17	They will eat up your crops and your food . They will strike down your sons and daughters . They will kill your sheep and cattle . They will destroy your vines and fig trees . You trust in your cities that have high walls around them . But the people in them will be killed by swords .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	18	“ In spite of that , even in those days I will not destroy you completely , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	19	‘ Jeremiah , ’ the people will ask , ‘ Why has the Lord our God done all this to us ? ’ Then you will tell them , ‘ You have deserted the Lord . You have served other gods in your own land . So now you will serve another nation in a land that is not your own. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	20	“ Here is what I want you to announce to the people of Jacob . Tell it in Judah . Tell them I say ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	21	‘ Listen to this , you foolish people , who do not have any sense . You have eyes , but you do not see . You have ears , but you do not hear .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	22	Shouldn ’ t you have respect for me ? ’ announces the Lord . ‘ Shouldn ’ t you tremble with fear in front of me ? I made the sand to hold the ocean back . It will do that forever . The ocean can ’ t go past it . The waves might roll , but they can ’ t sweep over it . They might roar , but they can ’ t go across it .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	23	But you people have stubborn hearts . You refuse to obey me . You have turned away from me . You have gone astray .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	24	You do not say to yourselves , “ Let us have respect for the Lord our God . He sends rain in the fall and the spring . He promises us that the harvest will come at the same time each year. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	25	But the things you have done wrong have robbed you of these gifts . Your sins have kept these good things far away from you. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	26	“ Jeremiah , some of my people are evil . They hide and wait just as people hide to catch birds . They set traps for people .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	27	A hunter uses tricks to fill his cage with birds . And my people have filled their houses with a lot of goods . They have become rich and powerful .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	28	They have grown fat and heavy . There is no limit to the evil things they do . In court they do not seek justice . They don ’ t protect the rights of children whose fathers have died . They do not stand up for poor people .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	29	Shouldn ’ t I punish them for this ? ” announces the Lord . “ Shouldn ’ t I pay back the nation that does these things ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	30	“ Something horrible and shocking has happened in the land .
NIRV	Jeremiah	5	31	The prophets prophesy lies . The priests rule by their own authority . And my people love it this way . But what will you do in the end ? ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	6	6	The Lord who rules over all speaks to the Babylonians . He says , “ Cut down some trees . Use the wood to build ramps against Jerusalem ’ s walls . I must punish that city . It is filled with people who treat others badly .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	2	I will destroy the city of Zion , even though it is very beautiful .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	3	Shepherds will come against it with their flocks . They will set up their tents around it . All of them will take care of their own sheep. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	4	The Babylonians say , “ Prepare for battle against Judah ! Get up ! Let ’ s attack them at noon ! But the daylight is fading . The shadows of evening are getting longer .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	5	So get up ! Let ’ s attack them at night ! Let ’ s destroy their strongest forts ! ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	7	Wells keep giving fresh water . And Jerusalem keeps on sinning . Its people are always fighting and causing trouble . When I look at them , I see nothing but sickness and wounds .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	8	Jerusalem , listen to my warning . If you do not , I will turn away from you . Your land will become a desert . No one will be able to live there. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	9	The Lord rules over all . He says to me , “ People gather the few grapes left on a vine . So let Israel ’ s enemies gather the few people left alive in the land Look carefully at the branches again . Do this like someone who gathers the last few grapes. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	10	Who can I speak to ? Who can I warn ? Who will even listen to me ? Their ears are closed so they can ’ t hear . The Lord ’ s message displeases them . They don ’ t take any delight in it .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	11	But the Lord ’ s anger burns inside me . I can no longer hold it in . The Lord says to me , “ Pour out my anger on the children in the street . Pour it out on the young men who are gathered together . Husband and wife alike will be caught in it . So will those who are very old .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	12	I will reach out my hand against those who live in the land , ” announces the Lord . “ Then their houses will be turned over to others . So will their fields and their wives .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	13	Everyone wants to get richer and richer , from the least important of them to the most important . Prophets and priests alike try to fool everyone they can .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	14	They bandage the wounds of my people as if they were not very deep . ‘ Peace , peace , ’ they say . But there isn ’ t any peace .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	15	Are they ashamed of their hateful actions ? No . They do not feel any shame at all . They do not even know how to blush . So they will fall like others who have already fallen . They will be brought down when I punish them , ” says the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	16	The Lord tells the people of Judah , “ Stand where the roads cross , and look around . Ask where the old paths are . Ask for the good path , and walk on it . Then your hearts will find rest in me . But you said , ‘ We won ’ t walk on it. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	17	I appointed prophets to warn you . I said , ‘ Listen to the sound of the trumpets ! ’ But you said , ‘ We won ’ t listen. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	18	So pay attention , you nations . You are witnesses for me . Watch what will happen to my people .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	19	Earth , pay attention . I am going to bring trouble on them . I will punish them because of the evil things they have done . They have not listened to my words . They have said no to my law .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	20	What do I care about incense from the land of Sheba ? Why should I bother with sweet-smelling cane from a land far away ? I do not accept your burnt offerings . Your sacrifices do not please me. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	21	So the Lord says , “ I will bring an army against the people of Judah . Parents and children alike will trip and fall . Neighbors and friends will die. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	22	The Lord says to Jerusalem , “ Look ! An army is coming from the land of the north . I am stirring up a great nation . Its army is coming from a land that is very far away .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	23	Its soldiers are armed with bows and spears . They are mean . They do not show any mercy at all . They come riding in on their horses . They sound like the roaring ocean . They are lined up for battle . They are marching out to attack you , city of Zion. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	24	We have heard reports about them . And our hands can ’ t help us . We are suffering greatly . It ’ s like the pain of a woman having a baby .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	25	Don ’ t go out to the fields . Don ’ t walk on the roads . Our enemies have swords . And there is terror on every side .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	26	My people , put on the clothes of sadness . Roll among the ashes . Mourn with bitter weeping just as you would mourn for an only son . The one who is going to destroy us will come suddenly .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	27	The Lord says to me , “ I have made you like one who tests metals . My people are the ore . I want you to watch them and test the way they live .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	28	All of them are used to disobeying me . They go around telling lies about others . They are like bronze mixed with iron . All of them do very sinful things .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	29	The fire is made very hot so the lead will burn away . But it is impossible to make these people pure . Those who are evil are not removed .
NIRV	Jeremiah	6	30	They are like silver that is thrown away . That is because I have not accepted them. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	7	7	If you obey me , I will let you live in this place . It is the land I gave your people of long ago . It was promised to them for ever and ever .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	2	“ Stand at the gate of my house . Announce my message to the people there . Say , “ ‘ Listen to the Lord ’ s message , all you people of Judah . You always come through these gates to worship the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	3	The God of Israel is speaking to you . He is the Lord who rules over all . He says , “ Change the way you live and act . Then I will let you live in this place .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	4	Do not trust in lies . Do not say , ‘ This is the temple of the Lord ! This is the temple of the Lord ! This is the temple of the Lord ! ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	5	You must really change the way you live and act . Treat one another fairly .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	6	Do not treat outsiders or widows badly in this place . Do not take advantage of children whose fathers have died . Do not kill those who are not guilty of doing anything wrong . Do not worship other gods . That will only bring harm to you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	8	But look ! You are trusting in worthless lies .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	9	“ ‘ “ You continue to steal and commit murder . You commit adultery . You tell lies in court . You burn incense to Baal . You worship other gods you didn ’ t know before .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	10	Then you come and stand in front of me . You keep coming to this house where I have put my Name . You say , ‘ We are safe. ’ You think you are safe when you do so many things I hate .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	11	My Name is in this house . But you have made it a den for robbers ! I have been watching you ! ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	12	“ ‘ “ Go now to the town of Shiloh . Go to the place where I first made a home for my Name . See what I did to it because of the evil things my people Israel were doing .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	13	I spoke to you again and again , ” announces the Lord . “ I warned you while you were doing all these things . But you did not listen . I called out to you . But you did not answer .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	14	So what I did to Shiloh I will now do to the house where my Name is . It is the temple you trust in . It is the place I gave to you and your people of long ago .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	15	But I will throw you out of my land . That is exactly what I did to the people of Ephraim . And they are your relatives. ” ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	16	“ Jeremiah , do not pray for these people . Do not make any appeal or request for them . Do not beg me . I will not listen to you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	17	Don ’ t you see what they are doing ? They are worshiping other gods in the towns of Judah . They are offering sacrifices to them in the streets of Jerusalem .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	18	The children go out and gather wood . The fathers light the fire . The women mix the dough . They make flat cakes of bread to offer to the female god called the Queen of Heaven . They pour out drink offerings to other gods . That makes me very angry .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	19	But am I the one they are hurting ? ” announces the Lord . “ Aren ’ t they only harming themselves ? They should be ashamed of it. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	20	So the Lord and King says , “ I will pour out my burning anger on this place . It will strike people and animals alike . It will destroy the trees in the fields and the crops in your land . It will burn , and no one will be able to put it out. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	21	The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , “ Go ahead ! Add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices . Eat the meat yourselves !
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	22	When I brought your people out of Egypt , I spoke to them . But I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	23	I also gave them another command . I said , ‘ Obey me . Then I will be your God . And you will be my people . Live the way I command you to live . Then things will go well with you. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	24	But they did not listen . They refused to pay any attention to me . Instead , they did what their stubborn and evil hearts wanted them to do . They went backward and not forward .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	25	Again and again I sent my servants the prophets to you . They came to you day after day . They prophesied from the time your people left Egypt until now .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	26	But your people of long ago did not listen . They refused to pay any attention to me . They were stubborn . They did more evil things than their people who lived before them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	27	“ Jeremiah , when you tell them all this , they will not listen to you . When you call out to them , they will not answer .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	28	So say to them , ‘ You are a nation that has not obeyed the Lord your God . You did not pay attention when you were corrected . Truth has died out . You do not tell the truth anymore. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	29	The Lord says to the people of Jerusalem , “ Cut off your hair . Throw it away . Sing a song of sadness on the bare hilltops . I am very angry with you . I have turned my back on you . I have deserted you . The Valley of Death
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	30	“ The people of Judah have done what is evil in my eyes , ” announces the Lord . “ They have set up statues of their gods . They have worshiped them in the house where my Name is . They have made my house ‘ unclean. ’ I hate those statues .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	31	The people have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom . There they worship other gods . And there they sacrifice their children in the fire . That is something I did not command . It did not even enter my mind .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	32	So watch out ! ” announces the Lord . “ The days are coming when people will not call it Topheth anymore . And they will not call it the Valley of Ben Hinnom either . Instead , they will call it the Valley of Death . They will bury the dead bodies of some people in Topheth . But they will run out of room .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	33	Then they will not be able to bury the bodies of other people there . So the bodies will become food for birds and wild animals . And no one will scare them away .
NIRV	Jeremiah	7	34	I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness . The voices of brides and grooms will not be heard anymore . There will be no sounds of joy in the towns of Judah . And there will be no joy in the streets of Jerusalem . The land will become a desert . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	8	8	“ ‘ “ How can you people say , ‘ We are wise . We have the law of the Lord ’ ? Actually , the teachers of the law have told lies about it . Their pens have not written what is true .
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	2	They will lie outside under the sun , moon and all the stars . All these people had loved and served these things . They had followed them and worshiped them . They had asked them for advice . So the bones of these people will not be gathered up or buried again . Instead , they will be like human waste lying there on the ground .
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	3	Everyone left alive in this evil nation will want to die rather than live . That is what they will long for in the lands where I force them to go. ” The Lord who rules over all announces this . The Lord Punishes His Sinful People
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	4	“ Jeremiah , tell them , ‘ The Lord says , “ ‘ “ When people fall down , don ’ t they get up again ? When someone turns away , don ’ t they come back ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	5	Then why have the people of Jerusalem turned away from me ? Why do they always turn away ? They keep on telling lies . They refuse to come back to me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	6	I have listened carefully . But they do not say what is right . They refuse to turn away from their sins . None of them says , ‘ What have I done ? ’ Each of them goes their own way . They are like horses charging into battle .
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	7	Storks know when to fly south . So do doves , swifts and thrushes . But my people do not know what I require them to do .
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	9	Those who think they are wise will be put to shame . They will become terrified . They will be trapped . They have not accepted my message . So what kind of wisdom do they have ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	10	I will give their wives to other men . I will give their fields to new owners . Everyone wants to get richer and richer . Everyone is greedy , from the least important to the most important . Prophets and priests alike try to fool everyone they can .
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	11	They bandage the wounds of my people as if they were not very deep . ‘ Peace , peace , ’ they say . But there isn ’ t any peace .
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	12	Are they ashamed of their hateful actions ? No . They do not feel any shame at all . They do not even know how to blush . So they will fall like others who have already fallen . They will be brought down when I punish them , ” says the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	13	“ ‘ “ I will take away their harvest , ” announces the Lord . “ There will not be any grapes on the vines . The trees will not bear any figs . The leaves on the trees will dry up . What I have given my people will be taken away from them. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	14	Why are we sitting here ? Let ’ s gather together ! Let ’ s run to the cities that have high walls around them ! Let ’ s die there ! The Lord our God has sentenced us to death . He has given us poisoned water to drink . That ’ s because we ’ ve sinned against him .
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	15	We hoped peace would come . But nothing good has happened to us . We hoped we would finally be healed . But there is only terror .
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	16	When our enemy ’ s horses snort , the noise is heard all the way from the city of Dan . When their stallions neigh , the whole land trembles with fear . They have come to destroy the land and everything in it . The city and everyone who lives there will be destroyed .
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	17	“ People of Judah , I will send poisonous snakes among you . No one will be able to charm them . And they will bite you , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	18	Lord , my heart is weak inside me . You comfort me when I ’ m sad .
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	19	Listen to the cries of my people from a land far away . They cry out , “ Isn ’ t the Lord in Zion ? Isn ’ t its King there anymore ? ” The Lord says , “ Why have they made me so angry by worshiping their wooden gods ? Why have they made me angry with their worthless statues of gods from other lands ? ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	20	The people say , “ The harvest is over . The summer has ended . And we still haven ’ t been saved. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	8	21	My people are crushed , so I am crushed . I mourn , and I am filled with horror .

NIRV	Jeremiah	9	9	Shouldn ’ t I punish them for this ? ” announces the Lord . “ Shouldn ’ t I pay back the nation that does these things ? ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	2	I wish I had somewhere to go in the desert where a traveler could stay ! Then I could leave my people . I could get away from them . All of them commit adultery by worshiping other gods . They aren ’ t faithful to the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	3	“ They get ready to use their tongues like bows , ” announces the Lord . “ Their mouths shoot out lies like arrows . They tell lies to gain power in the land . They go from one sin to another . They do not pay any attention to me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	4	Be on guard against your friends . Do not trust the members of your own family . Every one of them cheats . Every friend tells lies .
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	5	One friend cheats another . No one tells the truth . They have taught their tongues how to lie . They wear themselves out sinning .
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	6	Jeremiah , you live among people who tell lies . When they lie , they refuse to pay any attention to me , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	7	So the Lord who rules over all says , “ I will put them through the fire to test them . What else can I do ? My people are so sinful !
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	8	Their tongues are like deadly arrows . They tell lies . With their mouths all of them speak kindly to their neighbors . But in their hearts they set traps for them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	10	I will cry and mourn over the mountains . I will sing a song of sadness about the desert grasslands . They are dry and empty . No one travels through them . The mooing of cattle isn ’ t heard there . The birds have flown away . All the animals are gone .
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	11	The Lord says , “ I will knock down all of Jerusalem ’ s buildings . I will make it a home for wild dogs . The towns of Judah will be completely destroyed . No one will be able to live in them. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	12	Who is wise enough to understand these things ? Who has been taught by the Lord ? Who can explain them ? Why has the land been destroyed so completely ? Why has it become like a desert that no one can go across ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	13	The Lord answered me , “ Because my people have turned away from my law . I gave it to them . But they have not kept it . They have not obeyed me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	14	Instead , they have done what their stubborn hearts wanted them to do . They have worshiped the gods that are named Baal . They have done what their people have taught them to do through the years. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	15	So now the Lord who rules over all speaks . He is the God of Israel . He says , “ I will make these people eat bitter food . I will make them drink poisoned water .
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	16	I will scatter them among the nations . They and their people before them didn ’ t know about these nations . With swords I will chase these people . I will hunt them down until I have destroyed them. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	17	The Lord rules over all . He says , “ Here is something I want you to think about . Send for the women who mourn for the dead . Send for the most skilled among them. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	18	Let them come quickly and weep for us . Let them cry until tears flow from our eyes . Let them weep until water pours out of our eyes .
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	19	People are heard weeping in Zion . They are saying , “ We are destroyed ! We are filled with shame ! We must leave our land . Our houses have been torn down. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	20	You women , hear the Lord ’ s message . Listen to what he ’ s saying . Teach your daughters how to mourn for the dead . Teach one another a song of sadness .
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	21	Death has climbed in through our windows . It has entered our forts . Death has removed the children from the streets . It has taken the young men out of the market .
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	22	Say , “ The Lord announces , “ ‘ Dead bodies will be like human waste lying in the open fields . They will lie there like grain that is cut down at harvest time . No one will gather them up. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	23	The Lord says , “ Do not let wise people brag about how wise they are . Do not let strong people boast about how strong they are . Do not let rich people brag about how rich they are .
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	24	But here is what the one who brags should boast about . They should brag that they have the understanding to know me . I want them to know that I am the Lord . No matter what I do on earth , I am always kind , fair and right . And I take delight in this , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	25	“ The days are coming when I will judge people , ” announces the Lord . “ I will punish all those who are circumcised only in their bodies .
NIRV	Jeremiah	9	26	That includes the people of Egypt , Judah , Edom , Ammon and Moab . It also includes all those who live in the desert in places far away . None of the people in these nations is really circumcised . And not even the people of Israel are circumcised in their hearts. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	10	10	But you are the only true God . You are the only living God . You are the King who rules forever . When you are angry , the earth trembles with fear . The nations can ’ t stand up under your anger .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	2	He says , “ Do not follow the practices of other nations . Do not be terrified by warnings in the sky . Do not be afraid , even though the nations are terrified by them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	3	The practices of these nations are worthless . People cut a tree out of the forest . A skilled worker shapes the wood with a sharp tool .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	4	Others decorate it with silver and gold . They use a hammer to nail it to the floor . They want to keep it from falling down .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	5	The statues of their gods can ’ t speak . They are like scarecrows in a field of cucumbers . Their statues have to be carried around because they can ’ t walk . So do not be afraid of their gods . They can ’ t do you any harm . And they can ’ t do you any good either. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	6	Lord , no one is like you . You are great . You are mighty and powerful .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	7	King of the nations , everyone should have respect for you . That ’ s what people should give you . Among all the wise leaders of the nations there is no one like you . No one can compare with you in all their kingdoms .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	8	All of them are foolish . They don ’ t have any sense . They think they are taught by worthless wooden gods .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	9	Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish . Gold is brought from Uphaz . People skilled in working with wood and gold make a statue . Then they put blue and purple clothes on it . The whole thing is made by skilled workers .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	11	The Lord speaks to the Jews living in Babylon . He says , “ Here is what you must tell the people of the nations . Tell them , ‘ Your gods did not make the heavens and the earth . In fact , these gods will disappear from the earth . They will vanish from under the heavens. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	12	But God used his power to make the earth . His wisdom set the world in place . His understanding spread out the heavens .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	13	When he thunders , the waters in the heavens roar . He makes clouds rise from one end of the earth to the other . He sends lightning along with the rain . He brings the wind out from his storerooms .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	14	No one has any sense or knows anything at all . Everyone who works with gold is put to shame by his gods . The metal gods he has made are fakes . They can ’ t even breathe .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	15	They are worthless things that people make fun of . When the Lord judges them , they will be destroyed .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	16	The God of Jacob is not like them . He gives his people everything they need . He made everything that exists . And that includes Israel . They are the people who belong to him . His name is the Lord Who Rules Over All . The Land Will Be Destroyed
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	17	People of Jerusalem , your enemies have surrounded you . They are attacking you . So gather up what belongs to you . Then leave the land .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	18	The Lord says , “ I am about to throw out of this land everyone who lives in it . I will bring trouble on them . They will be captured. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	19	How terrible it will be for me ! I ’ ve been wounded ! And my wound can ’ t be healed ! In spite of that , I said to myself , “ I ’ m sick . But I ’ ll have to put up with it. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	20	Jerusalem is like a tent that has been destroyed . All its ropes have snapped . My people have gone away from me . Now no one is left to set up my tent . I have no one to set up my shelter .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	21	The leaders of my people are like shepherds who don ’ t have any sense . They don ’ t ask the Lord for advice . That ’ s why they don ’ t succeed . And that ’ s why their whole flock is scattered like sheep .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	22	Listen ! A message is coming ! I hear the sound of a great army marching down from the north ! It will turn Judah ’ s towns into a desert . They will become a home for wild dogs . Jeremiah Prays to the Lord
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	23	Lord , I know that a person doesn ’ t control their own life . They don ’ t direct their own steps .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	24	Correct me , Lord , but please be fair . Don ’ t correct me when you are angry . If you do , nothing will be left of me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	10	25	Pour out your great anger on the nations . They don ’ t pay any attention to you . They refuse to worship you . They have destroyed the people of Jacob . They ’ ve wiped them out completely . They ’ ve also destroyed the land they lived in . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	11	11	So I say , ‘ I will bring trouble on them . They will not be able to escape it . They will cry out to me . But I will not listen to them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	2	“ Listen to the terms of the covenant I made with my people of long ago . Tell Judah the terms still apply to them . Tell those who live in Jerusalem that they must obey them too .
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	3	I am the Lord , the God of Israel . So let the people know what I want them to do . Here is what I want you to tell them . ‘ May the person who does not obey the terms of the covenant be under my curse .
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	4	I gave those terms to your people of long ago . That was when I brought them out of Egypt . I saved them out of that furnace that melts down iron and makes it pure. ’ I said , ‘ Obey me . Do everything I command you to do . Then you will be my people . And I will be your God .
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	5	I raised my hand and made a promise to your people of long ago . I promised them I would give them a land that had plenty of milk and honey. ’ It is the land you own today . I kept my promise. ” I replied , “ Amen , Lord. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	6	The Lord said to me , “ Here is what I want you to announce in the towns of Judah . Say it also in the streets of Jerusalem . Tell the people , ‘ Listen to the terms of my covenant . Obey them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	7	Long ago I brought your people up from Egypt . From that time until today , I warned them again and again . I said , “ Obey me. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	8	But they did not listen . They did not pay any attention to me . Instead , they did what their stubborn and evil hearts wanted them to do . So I brought down on them all the curses of the covenant . I commanded them to obey it . But they refused. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	9	The Lord continued , “ The people of Judah have made some evil plans . So have those who live in Jerusalem .
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	10	All of them have returned to the sins their people of long ago committed . Those people refused to listen to what I told them . And now the people of Israel and Judah alike have worshiped other gods and served them . They have broken the covenant I made with their people who lived before them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	12	The people of Jerusalem and of the towns of Judah will cry out . They will cry out to the gods they burn incense to . But those gods will not help them at all when trouble strikes them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	13	Judah , you have as many gods as you have towns . And in Jerusalem you have set up as many altars as there are streets . You are burning incense to that shameful god named Baal. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	14	“ Jeremiah , do not pray for these people . Do not make any appeal or request for them . They will call out to me when they are in trouble . But I will not listen to them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	15	“ I love the people of Judah . But they are working out their evil plans along with many others . So what are they doing in my temple ? Can meat that is offered to me keep me from punishing you ? When you do evil things , you get a lot of pleasure from them. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	16	People of Judah , the Lord once called you a healthy olive tree . He thought its fruit was beautiful . But now he will come with the roar of a mighty storm . He will set the tree on fire . And its branches will be broken .
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	17	The Lord who rules over all planted you . But now he has ordered your enemies to destroy you . The people of Israel and Judah have both done what is evil . They have made the Lord very angry by burning incense to Baal . Jeremiah ’ s Enemies Make Evil Plans Against Him
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	18	The Lord told me about the evil plans of my enemies . That ’ s how I knew about them . He showed me what they were doing .
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	19	I had been like a gentle lamb led off to be killed . I didn ’ t realize they had made plans against me . They had said , “ Let ’ s destroy the tree and its fruit . Let ’ s take away his life . Then his name won ’ t be remembered anymore. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	20	But Lord , you rule over all . You always judge fairly . You test people ’ s hearts and minds . So pay them back for what they ’ ve done . I ’ ve committed my cause to you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	21	The Lord says , “ Jeremiah , here is what I am telling you about the people of Anathoth . They say they ’ re going to kill you . They are saying , ‘ Don ’ t prophesy in the Lord ’ s name . If you do , we will kill you with our own hands. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	22	So the Lord who rules over all says , “ I will punish them . Their young men will be killed by swords . Their sons and daughters will die of hunger .
NIRV	Jeremiah	11	23	Only a few people will be left alive . I will judge the people of Anathoth . I will destroy them when the time comes to punish them. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	12	12	Many will come to destroy it . They will gather on the bare hilltops in the desert . I will use them as my sword to destroy my people . They will kill them from one end of the land to the other . No one will be safe .
NIRV	Jeremiah	12	2	You have planted them . Their roots are deep in the ground . They grow and produce fruit . They honor you by what they say . But their hearts are far away from you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	12	3	Lord , you know me and see me . You test my thoughts about you . Drag those people off like sheep to be killed ! Set them apart for the day of their death !
NIRV	Jeremiah	12	4	How long will the land be thirsty for water ? How long will the grass in every field be dry ? The people who live in the land are evil . So the animals and birds have died . And that ’ s not all . The people are saying , “ The Lord won ’ t see what happens to us. ” The Lord Answers Jeremiah
NIRV	Jeremiah	12	5	The Lord says , “ Suppose you have raced against people . And suppose they have worn you out . Then how would you be able to race against horses ? Suppose you feel safe only in open country . Then how would you get along in the bushes near the Jordan River ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	12	6	Even your relatives have turned against you . They are members of your own family . They have shouted loudly at you . They might say nice things about you . But do not trust them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	12	7	“ I will turn my back on my people . I will desert my land . I love the people of Judah . In spite of that , I will hand them over to their enemies .
NIRV	Jeremiah	12	8	My land has become to me like a lion in the forest . It roars at me . So I hate it .
NIRV	Jeremiah	12	9	My own land has become like a spotted hawk . And other hawks surround it and attack it . Come , all you wild animals ! Gather together ! Come together to eat up my land .
NIRV	Jeremiah	12	10	Many shepherds will destroy my vineyard . They will walk all over it . They will turn my pleasant vineyard into a dry and empty land .
NIRV	Jeremiah	12	11	My vineyard will become a desert . It will be dry and empty in my sight . The whole land will be completely destroyed . And no one even cares .
NIRV	Jeremiah	12	13	People will plant wheat . But all they will gather is thorns . They will wear themselves out . But they will not have anything to show for it . I am very angry with them . So they will be ashamed of the crop they gather. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	12	14	Here is what the Lord says . “ All my evil neighbors have taken over the land I gave my people Israel . So I will pull them up by their roots from the lands they live in . And I will pull up the roots of the people of Judah from among them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	12	15	But after I pull up those nations , I will give my tender love to them again . I will bring all of them back to their own lands . I will take all of them back to their own countries .
NIRV	Jeremiah	12	16	Suppose those nations learn to follow the practices of my people . And they make their promises in my name . When they promise , they say , ‘ You can be sure that the Lord is alive. ’ They do this just as they once taught my people to make promises in Baal ’ s name . Then I will give them a place among my people .

NIRV	Jeremiah	13	13	If they do , here is what you must tell them . ‘ The Lord says , “ I am going to fill with wine everyone who lives in this land . I will make the kings who sit on David ’ s throne drunk . And I will fill with wine the priests , the prophets and everyone who lives in Jerusalem .
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	2	So I bought a belt , just as the Lord had told me to do . And I put it around my waist .
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	3	Then another message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	4	“ Take off the belt you bought and are wearing around your waist . Go to Perath . Hide the belt there in a crack in the rocks. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	5	So I went and hid it at Perath . I did just as the Lord had told me to do .
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	6	Many days later the Lord said to me , “ Go to Perath . Get the belt I told you to hide there. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	7	So I went to Perath . I dug up the belt . I took it from the place where I had hidden it . But it had rotted . It was completely useless .
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	8	Then another message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	9	“ In the same way , I will destroy Judah ’ s pride . And I will destroy the great pride of Jerusalem .
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	10	These people are evil . They refuse to listen to what I say . They do what their stubborn hearts want them to do . They chase after other gods . They serve them and worship them . So they will be like this belt . They will be completely useless .
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	11	A belt is tied around a person ’ s waist . In the same way , I tied all the people of Israel to me . I also tied all the people of Judah to me like a belt . I wanted them to be my people . They should have brought me fame and praise and honor . But they have not listened to me , ” announces the Lord . Wineskins
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	12	“ Tell them , ‘ The Lord is the God of Israel . He says , “ Every wineskin should be filled with wine. ” ’ Here is what the people might say to you . ‘ Don ’ t we know that every wineskin should be filled with wine ? ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	14	I will smash them against one another . I will punish parents and children alike , ” announces the Lord . “ I will not feel sorry for them . I will not show them any kindness . My tender love for them will not keep me from destroying them. ” ’ ” Judah Will Be Taken Away From Their Land
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	15	People of Judah , listen to me . Pay attention and don ’ t be proud . The Lord has spoken .
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	16	Give glory to the Lord your God . Honor him before he sends darkness to cover the land . Do this before you trip and fall on the darkened hills . You hope that light will come . But he will turn it into thick darkness . He will change it to deep shadows .
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	17	If you don ’ t listen , I will weep in secret . Because you are so proud , I will weep bitterly . Tears will flow from my eyes . The Lord ’ s flock will be taken away as prisoners .
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	18	Speak to the king and his mother . Tell them , “ Come down from your thrones . Your glorious crowns are about to fall from your heads. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	19	The gates of the cities in the Negev Desert will be shut tight . There won ’ t be anyone to open them . Everyone in Judah will be carried away as prisoners . You will be completely taken away .
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	20	Jerusalem , look up ! Your enemies are coming from the north . Where is the flock you were supposed to take care of ? Where are the sheep you were so proud of ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	21	You have worked hard to make special friends . But the Lord will let them rule over you . Then what will you say ? Suffering will take hold of you . It will be like the pain of a woman having a baby .
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	22	Suppose you ask yourself , “ Why has this happened to me ? ” It ’ s because you have committed so many sins . That ’ s the reason your skirt has been torn off . That ’ s why your body has been treated so badly .
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	23	Can people from Ethiopia change their skin ? Can leopards change their spots ? It ’ s the same with you . You have always done what is evil . So how can you do what is good ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	24	The Lord says , “ I will scatter you like straw that the desert wind blows away .
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	25	This is what will happen to you . I have appointed it for you , ” announces the Lord . “ You have forgotten me . You have trusted in other gods .
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	26	So I will pull your skirt up over your face . Then people will see the shame of your naked body .
NIRV	Jeremiah	13	27	They will see that you have not been faithful to me . You have committed adultery with other gods . And you have acted like a prostitute who does not have any shame . I have seen what you did on the hills and in the fields . And I hate it . How terrible it will be for you , Jerusalem ! How long will you choose to be ‘ unclean ’ ? ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	14	14	Then the Lord said to me , “ The prophets are prophesying lies in my name . I have not sent them or appointed them . I have not even spoken to them . Everything they tell you about their visions or secret knowledge is a lie . They pretend to bring you messages from other gods . They try to get you to believe their own mistaken ideas .
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	2	“ Judah is filled with sadness . Its cities are wasting away . The people weep for the land . Crying is heard in Jerusalem .
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	3	The nobles send their servants to get water . They go to the wells . But they do not find any water . They return with empty jars . They are terrified . They do not have any hope . They cover their heads .
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	4	The ground is dry and cracked . There isn ’ t any rain in the land . The farmers are terrified . They cover their heads .
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	5	Even the female deer in the fields desert their newborn fawns . There isn ’ t any grass to eat .
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	6	Wild donkeys stand on the bare hilltops . They long for water as wild dogs do . Their eyesight fails because they do not have any food to eat. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	7	Lord , our sins are a witness against us . But do something for the honor of your name . We have often turned away from you . We ’ ve sinned against you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	8	You are Israel ’ s only hope . You save us when we ’ re in trouble . Why are you like a stranger to us ? Why are you like a traveler who stays for only one night ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	9	Why are you like a man taken by surprise ? Why are you like a soldier who can ’ t save anyone ? Lord , you are among us . And we are your people . Please don ’ t desert us !
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	10	The Lord gave Jeremiah a message about these people . The Lord said , “ They really love to wander away from me . Their feet go down the wrong path . I do not accept these people . I will remember the evil things they have done . I will punish them for their sins. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	11	The Lord continued , “ Do not pray that things will go well with them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	12	Even if they go without food , I will not listen to their cry for help . They might sacrifice burnt offerings and grain offerings . But I will not accept them . Instead , I will destroy them with war , hunger and plague. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	13	But I said , “ Lord and King , the prophets keep telling them something else . They say , ‘ You won ’ t have to suffer from war or hunger . Instead , the Lord will give you peace and rest in this place. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	15	So here is what I am saying about the prophets who are prophesying in my name . I did not send them . But they are saying , ‘ No war or hunger will come to this land. ’ Those same prophets will die because of war and hunger .
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	16	And the people they are prophesying to will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem . They will die because of hunger and war . No one will bury them . No one will bury their wives and children . I will pour out trouble on them . That is exactly what they should get .
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	17	“ Jeremiah , give them this message . Tell them , “ ‘ Let tears flow from my eyes . Let them pour out night and day . Never let them stop . The people of my own nation have suffered a terrible wound . They have been crushed .
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	18	Suppose I go into the country . Then I see people who have been killed by swords . Or suppose I go into the city . Then I see people who have died of hunger . Prophet and priest alike have gone to a land they hadn ’ t known about before. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	19	Lord , have you completely turned your back on Judah ? Do you hate the city of Zion ? Why have you made us suffer ? We can ’ t be healed . We hoped peace would come . But nothing good has happened to us . We hoped we would finally be healed . But all we got was terror .
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	20	Lord , we admit we ’ ve done evil things . We also admit that our people of long ago were guilty . It ’ s true that we ’ ve sinned against you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	21	For the honor of your name , don ’ t turn your back on us . Don ’ t bring shame on your glorious throne in the temple . Remember the covenant you made with us . Please don ’ t break it .
NIRV	Jeremiah	14	22	Do any of the worthless gods of the nations bring rain ? Do the skies send down showers all by themselves ? No . Lord our God , you send the rain . So we put our hope in you . You are the one who does all these things . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	15	2	Suppose these people ask you , ‘ Where should we go ? ’ Then tell them , ‘ The Lord says , “ ‘ “ Those I have appointed to die will die .

NIRV	Jeremiah	15	8	I will increase the number of their widows . There will be more of them than the grains of sand on the seashore . At noon I will bring a destroyer against the mothers of the young men among my people . All at once I will bring down on them great suffering and terror .
NIRV	Jeremiah	15	9	Mothers who have many children will grow weak . They will take their last breath . The sun will set on them while it is still day . They will be dishonored and put to shame . All those who are left alive I will kill by swords . I will have their enemies do this , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	15	10	My mother , I wish I had never been born ! The whole land opposes me . They fight against me . I haven ’ t made loans to anyone . And I haven ’ t borrowed anything . But everyone curses me anyway .
NIRV	Jeremiah	15	11	The Lord said , “ Jeremiah , I will keep you safe for a good purpose . I will make your enemies ask you to pray for them . They will make their appeal to you when they are in great trouble .
NIRV	Jeremiah	15	12	“ People of Judah , the armies of Babylon will come from the north . They are as strong as iron and bronze . Can anyone break their power ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	15	13	I will give away your wealth and your treasures . Your enemies will carry off everything . And they will not pay anything for it . That will happen because you have sinned so much . You have done it throughout your country .

NIRV	Jeremiah	15	16	When I received your words , I ate them . They filled me with joy . My heart took delight in them . Lord God who rules over all , I belong to you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	15	17	I never sat around with those who go to wild parties . I never had a good time with them . I sat alone because you had put your powerful hand on me . Your anger against sin was burning inside me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	15	18	Why does my pain never end ? Why is my wound so deep ? Why can ’ t I ever get well ? To me you are like a stream that runs dry . You are like a spring that doesn ’ t have any water .
NIRV	Jeremiah	15	19	So the Lord says to Jeremiah , “ If you turn away from your sins , I will heal you . And then you will be able to serve me . Speak words that are worthy , not worthless . Then you will be speaking for me . Let these people turn to you . But you must not turn to them .

NIRV	Jeremiah	16	6	“ Important and unimportant people alike will die in this land . Their bodies will not be buried . No one will mourn for them . No one will cut themselves or shave their head for the dead .
NIRV	Jeremiah	16	7	No one will offer food or drink to comfort those who mourn for the dead . No one will do this even if someone ’ s father or mother has died .
NIRV	Jeremiah	16	8	“ Do not enter a house where a feast is being held . Do not sit down there to eat and drink .
NIRV	Jeremiah	16	9	I am the Lord who rules over all . I am the God of Israel . I am telling you , ‘ In your days I will judge your people . You will see it with your own eyes . I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness here in Jerusalem . The voices of brides and grooms will not be heard anymore. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	16	10	“ Tell these people all these things . They will ask you , ‘ Why has the Lord decided to send so much trouble on us ? We haven ’ t done anything wrong . We haven ’ t committed any sins against the Lord our God. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	16	11	When they say this , here is what you should tell them . ‘ I did it because your people of long ago deserted me , ’ announces the Lord . ‘ They followed other gods . They served them and worshiped them . They deserted me . They did not obey my law .
NIRV	Jeremiah	16	12	But you have done more evil things than they did . All of you are doing what your stubborn and evil hearts want you to do . You are not obeying me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	16	13	So I will throw you out of this land . I will send you away to another land . Neither you nor your people of long ago have known about it . There you will serve other gods day and night . And I will not give you any help. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	16	14	“ But a new day is coming , ” announces the Lord . “ At that time here is what people will no longer say . ‘ As sure as he is alive , the Lord brought the Israelites up out of Egypt. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	16	15	Instead , they will say , ‘ The Lord brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north . He gathered them out of all the countries where he had forced them to go . And that ’ s just as sure as he is alive. ’ I will bring them back to the land I gave their people of long ago .
NIRV	Jeremiah	16	17	My eyes see everything these people do . What they do is not hidden from me . I always see their sin .
NIRV	Jeremiah	16	18	I will pay them back double for their sin and the evil things they have done . They have made my land ‘ unclean. ’ They have set up lifeless statues of their evil gods . They have filled my land with them . I hate those gods. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	16	19	Lord , you give me strength . You are like a fort to me . When I ’ m in trouble , I go to you for safety . The nations will come to you from one end of the earth to the other . They will gather together and say , “ Our people of long ago didn ’ t own anything except statues of gods . The statues were worthless . They didn ’ t do them any good .
NIRV	Jeremiah	16	20	Do human beings really make their own gods ? Yes . But they aren ’ t really gods at all ! ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	16	21	The Lord says , “ So I will teach them about myself . This time I will show them how powerful and mighty I am . Then they will know that I am the Lord . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	17	2	Even their children offer sacrifices to other gods on those altars . They use the poles that were made to worship the female god named Asherah . They worship strange gods beside the green trees and on the high hills .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	3	I will give away my holy Mount Zion to the Babylonians . Your enemies will carry off your wealth and all your treasures . I will give away your high places . That will happen because you have sinned . You have done it throughout your country .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	4	You will lose the land I gave you . And it will be your own fault . I will make you slaves to your enemies . You will serve them in a land you didn ’ t know about before . You have set my anger on fire . It will burn forever. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	5	The Lord says , “ Those who trust in human beings are under my curse . They depend on human strength . Their hearts turn away from me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	6	They will be like a bush in a dry and empty land . They will not enjoy success when it comes . They will live in dry places in the desert . It is a land of salt where no one else lives .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	7	“ But I will bless anyone who trusts in me . I will do good things for the person who depends on me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	8	They will be like a tree planted near water . It sends out its roots beside a stream . It is not afraid when heat comes . Its leaves are always green . It does not worry when there is no rain . It always bears fruit. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	9	A human heart is more dishonest than anything else . It can ’ t be healed . Who can understand it ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	10	The Lord says , “ I look deep down inside human hearts . I see what is in people ’ s minds . I reward each person in keeping with their conduct . I bless them based on what they have done. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	11	Some people get rich by doing sinful things . They are like a partridge that hatches eggs it didn ’ t lay . When their lives are half over , their riches will desert them . In the end they will prove how foolish they have been .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	12	Our temple is where the Lord ’ s glorious throne is . From the beginning it has been high and lifted up .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	13	Lord , you are Israel ’ s only hope . Everyone who deserts you will be put to shame . The names of those who turn away from you will be listed among the dead . Lord , they have deserted you . You are the spring of water that gives life .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	14	Lord , heal me . Then I will be healed . Save me from my enemies . Then I will be saved . You are the one I praise .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	15	They keep saying to me , “ What has happened to the message the Lord gave you ? Let it come true right now ! ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	16	I haven ’ t run away from being the shepherd of your people . You know I haven ’ t wanted the day of Jerusalem ’ s fall to come . You are aware of every word that comes from my lips .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	18	Let those who attack me be put to shame . But keep me from shame . Let them be terrified . But keep me from terror . Bring the day of trouble on them . Destroy them once and for all . Keep the Sabbath Day Holy
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	19	The Lord said to me , “ Go . Stand at the city gate called the Gate of the People . That is where the kings of Judah go in and out . Then stand at all the other gates of Jerusalem .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	20	Say , ‘ Listen to the Lord ’ s message , you kings of Judah and all you people of Judah and Jerusalem . You always come through these gates .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	21	The Lord says , “ Make sure you do not carry a load on the Sabbath day . Do not bring it through the gates of Jerusalem .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	22	Do not bring a load out of your houses on the Sabbath day . Do not do any work on that day . Instead , keep the Sabbath day holy . Do as I commanded your people of long ago .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	23	But they did not listen . They did not pay any attention to me . They were stubborn . They would not listen or pay attention when I corrected them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	24	Be careful to obey me , ” announces the Lord . “ Do not bring a load through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day . Instead , keep the Sabbath day holy . Do not do any work on it .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	25	Then kings who sit on David ’ s throne will come through the gates of this city . They and their officials will come riding in chariots and on horses . The people of Judah and Jerusalem will come along with them . And this city will always have people living in it .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	26	Some will come from the towns of Judah . And some will come in from the villages around Jerusalem . Others will come from the territory of Benjamin . And others will come in from the western hills . Still others will come from the central hill country and the Negev Desert . All of them will bring burnt offerings and sacrifices . They will come bringing grain offerings , incense and thank offerings . They will take all these offerings to my house .
NIRV	Jeremiah	17	27	But what if you do not obey me ? Suppose you do not keep the Sabbath day holy . And suppose you carry a load through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day . Then I will start a fire that can ’ t be put out . It will begin at the gates of Jerusalem . It will destroy its mighty towers. ” ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	18	18	They said , “ Come on . Let ’ s make plans against Jeremiah . We ’ ll still have priests to teach us the law . We ’ ll always have wise people to give us advice . We ’ ll have prophets to bring us messages from the Lord . So come on . Let ’ s speak out against Jeremiah . We shouldn ’ t pay any attention to what he says. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	2	“ Jeremiah , go down to the potter ’ s house . I will give you my message there. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	3	So I went down to the potter ’ s house . I saw him working at his wheel .
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	4	His hands were shaping a pot out of clay . But he saw that something was wrong with it . So he formed it into another pot . He shaped it in the way that seemed best to him .
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	5	Then the Lord ’ s message came to me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	6	“ People of Israel , I can do with you just as this potter does , ” announces the Lord . “ The clay is in the potter ’ s hand . And you are in my hand , people of Israel .
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	7	Suppose I announce that something will happen to a nation or kingdom . Suppose I announce that it will be pulled up by the roots . And I announce that it will be torn down and destroyed .
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	8	But suppose the nation I warned turns away from its sins . Then I will not do what I said I would . I will not bring trouble on it as I had planned .
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	9	But suppose I announce that a nation or kingdom is going to be built up and planted .
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	10	And then it does what is evil in my eyes . It does not obey me . Then I will think again about the good things I had wanted to do for it .
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	11	“ So speak to the people of Judah and Jerusalem . Tell them , ‘ The Lord says , “ Look ! I am making plans against you . I am going to bring trouble on you . So each one of you must turn from your evil ways . Change the way you live and act. ” ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	12	But they will reply , ‘ It ’ s no use . We will continue to do what we ’ ve already planned . All of us will do what our stubborn and evil hearts want us to do. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	13	So the Lord says , “ Ask the nations a question . Say to them , ‘ Who has ever heard anything like this ? The people of Israel have done a very horrible thing .
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	14	Does the snow ever disappear from Lebanon ’ s rocky slopes ? Do its cool waters ever stop flowing from places far away ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	15	But my people have forgotten me . They burn incense to worthless gods . Their gods made them trip and fall as they walked on the old paths . They made them use side roads instead of roads that were built up .
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	16	So their land will become a horrible thing . People will make fun of it again and again . All those who pass by it will be shocked . They will shake their heads .
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	17	I will sweep over my people like a wind from the east . I will use the Babylonians to scatter them . I will show them my back and not my face . I will desert them when their day of trouble comes. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	19	Lord , please listen to me ! Hear what my enemies are saying about me !
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	20	Should the good things I ’ ve done be paid back with evil ? But my enemies have dug a pit for me . Remember that I stood in front of you and spoke up for them . I tried to turn your anger away from them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	21	So let their children die of hunger . Let my enemies be killed in war . Let their wives lose their children and husbands . Let their men be put to death . Let their young men be killed in battle .
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	22	Bring their enemies against them without warning . Let cries be heard from their houses . They have dug a pit to capture me . They have hidden traps for my feet .
NIRV	Jeremiah	18	23	But Lord , you know all about their plans to kill me . Don ’ t forgive their crimes . Don ’ t erase their sins from your sight . Destroy my enemies . Punish them when the time to show your anger comes . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	19	19	The Lord said to Jeremiah , “ Go and buy a clay jar from a potter . Take along some of the elders of the people . Also tell some of the priests to go with you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	19	2	Go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom . Stand near the entrance of the gate where broken pieces of pottery are thrown away . There announce the message I give you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	19	3	Tell the people , ‘ Listen to the Lord ’ s message , you kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem . The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , “ Listen ! I am going to bring trouble on Jerusalem . It will be so horrible that it will make the ears of everyone who hears about it ring .
NIRV	Jeremiah	19	4	My people have deserted me . They have made this city a place where other gods are worshiped . They have burned incense to them here . They , their people of long ago and the kings of Judah had never known these gods . My people have also filled this place with the blood of those who aren ’ t guilty .
NIRV	Jeremiah	19	5	They have built the high places where they worship Baal . There they sacrifice their children in the fire as offerings to Baal . That is something I did not command or talk about . It did not even enter my mind .
NIRV	Jeremiah	19	6	So watch out ! ” announces the Lord . “ The days are coming when people will not call this place Topheth anymore . And they will not call it the Valley of Ben Hinnom either . Instead , they will call it the Valley of Death .
NIRV	Jeremiah	19	7	“ ‘ “ In this place I will make the plans of Judah and Jerusalem as useless as a broken jar . I will use their enemies to kill my people by swords . They will die at the hands of those who want to take their lives . I will give their dead bodies as food to the birds and the wild animals .
NIRV	Jeremiah	19	8	I will completely destroy this city . I will make it a horrible thing . People will make fun of it . All those who pass by it will be shocked . They will laugh at its people because of all their wounds .
NIRV	Jeremiah	19	9	I will make the people of this city eat their sons and daughters . And they will eat one another . They will do this because things will be so bad during the attack . The enemies who want to take their lives will bring all this trouble on them. ” ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	19	10	“ Jeremiah , break the jar while those who go with you are watching .
NIRV	Jeremiah	19	11	Tell them , ‘ Here is what the Lord who rules over all says . “ This potter ’ s jar is smashed and can ’ t be repaired . And I will smash this nation and this city . People will bury their dead in Topheth . But they will run out of room .
NIRV	Jeremiah	19	12	Here is what I will do to Jerusalem and those who live here , ” ’ announces the Lord . ‘ “ I will make this city like Topheth .
NIRV	Jeremiah	19	13	The houses in Jerusalem will be made ‘ unclean ’ like Topheth . So will the houses of the kings of Judah . All these people burned incense on their roofs to all the stars . They poured out drink offerings to other gods. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	19	14	Then Jeremiah returned from Topheth . That ’ s where the Lord had sent him to prophesy . Jeremiah stood in the courtyard of the Lord ’ s temple . He spoke to all the people . He said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	19	15	“ The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , ‘ Listen ! I am going to punish this city and all the villages around it .

NIRV	Jeremiah	20	20	Pashhur the priest was the official in charge of the Lord ’ s temple . He was the son of Immer . Pashhur heard Jeremiah prophesying that Jerusalem would be destroyed .
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	2	So he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten . Then Pashhur put him in prison at the Upper Gate of Benjamin at the Lord ’ s temple .
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	3	The next day Pashhur set him free . Jeremiah said to him , “ The Lord ’ s name for you isn ’ t Pashhur . The Lord ’ s name for you is Terror on Every Side .
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	4	The Lord says to you , ‘ I will make you a terror to yourself . You will also be a terror to all your friends . With your own eyes you will see them die . Their enemies will kill them with swords . I will hand over all the people of Judah to the king of Babylon . He will carry them away to Babylon or kill them with swords .
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	5	I will hand over all the wealth of this city to Judah ’ s enemies . I will give them all its products and everything of value . I will turn over to them all the treasures that belonged to the kings of Judah . They will take these things and carry them off to Babylon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	6	Pashhur , you and everyone who lives in your house will also be forced to go there . You have prophesied lies to all your friends . So all of you will die and be buried in Babylon. ’ ” Jeremiah Complains to the Lord
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	7	You tricked me , Lord , and I was tricked . You overpowered me and won . People make fun of me all day long . Everyone laughs at me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	8	Every time I speak , I cry out . All you ever tell me to talk about is fighting and trouble . Your message has brought me nothing but dishonor . It has made me suffer shame all day long .
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	9	Sometimes I think , “ I won ’ t talk about his message anymore . I ’ ll never speak in his name again. ” But then your message burns in my heart . It ’ s like a fire deep inside my bones . I ’ m tired of holding it in . In fact , I can ’ t .
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	10	I hear many people whispering , “ There is terror on every side ! Bring charges against Jeremiah ! Let ’ s bring charges against him ! ” All my friends are waiting for me to slip . They are saying , “ Perhaps he will be tricked into making a mistake . Then we ’ ll win out over him . We ’ ll get even with him. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	11	But you are with me like a mighty warrior . So those who are trying to harm me will trip and fall . They won ’ t win out over me . They will fail . They ’ ll be totally put to shame . Their dishonor will never be forgotten .
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	12	Lord , you rule over all . You test those who do what is right . You see what is in people ’ s hearts and minds . So pay them back for what they ’ ve done . I ’ ve committed my cause to you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	13	Sing to the Lord , you people ! Give praise to him ! He saves the lives of people in need . He saves them from the power of sinful people .
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	14	May the day I was born be cursed ! May the day I was born to my mother not be blessed !
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	15	May the man who brought my father the news be cursed ! He ’ s the one who made my father very glad . He said , “ You have had a baby ! It ’ s a boy ! ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	16	May that man be like the towns the Lord destroyed without pity . May that man hear loud weeping in the morning . May he hear a battle cry at noon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	17	He should have killed me in my mother ’ s body . He should have made my mother my grave . He should have let her body stay large forever .
NIRV	Jeremiah	20	18	Why did I ever come out of my mother ’ s body ? I ’ ve seen nothing but trouble and sorrow . My days will end in shame . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	21	21	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . It came when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur to Jeremiah . Pashhur was the son of Malkijah . Zedekiah sent Zephaniah the priest along with him . Zephaniah was the son of Maaseiah . They said to Jeremiah ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	21	2	“ Ask the Lord to help us . Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is attacking us . In the past the Lord did wonderful things for us . Maybe he ’ ll do them again . Then Nebuchadnezzar will pull his armies back from us. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	21	3	But Jeremiah answered them , “ Tell Zedekiah and his people ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	21	4	‘ The Lord is the God of Israel . He says , “ The king of Babylon and his armies are all around this city . They are getting ready to attack you . You have weapons of war in your hands to fight against them . But I am about to turn your weapons against you . And I will bring your enemies inside this city .
NIRV	Jeremiah	21	5	I myself will fight against you . I will reach out my powerful hand and mighty arm . I will come against you with all my great anger .
NIRV	Jeremiah	21	6	I will strike down those who live in this city . I will kill people and animals alike . They will die of a terrible plague .
NIRV	Jeremiah	21	7	After that , I will hand you over to your enemies . They want to kill you , ” announces the Lord . “ I will hand over Zedekiah , the king of Judah , and his officials . I will also hand over the people in this city who live through the plague , war and hunger . All of them will be handed over to Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon . He will kill them with swords . He will show them no mercy . He will not feel sorry for them . In fact , he will not have any concern for them at all. ” ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	21	8	“ Tell the people , ‘ The Lord says , “ I am offering you a choice . You can choose the way that leads to life . Or you can choose the way that leads to death .
NIRV	Jeremiah	21	9	Those who stay in this city will die of war , hunger or plague . But suppose some go out and give themselves up to the Babylonians attacking you . They will live . They will escape with their lives .
NIRV	Jeremiah	21	10	I have decided to do this city harm and not good , ” announces the Lord . “ It will be handed over to the king of Babylon . And he will destroy it with fire. ” ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	21	11	“ Also speak to Judah ’ s royal family . Tell them , ‘ Listen to the Lord ’ s message .
NIRV	Jeremiah	21	12	Here is what the Lord says to you who belong to David ’ s royal house . “ ‘ “ Every morning do what is right and fair . Save those who have been robbed . Set them free from the people who have treated them badly . If you do not , my anger will blaze out against you . It will burn like fire because of the evil things you have done . No one will be able to put it out .
NIRV	Jeremiah	21	13	Jerusalem , I am against you , ” announces the Lord . “ You live above this valley . You are on a high , rocky plain . And you say , ‘ Who can come against us ? Who can enter our place of safety ? ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	21	14	But I will punish you in keeping with what you have done , ” announces the Lord . “ I will start a fire in your forests . It will burn down everything around you. ” ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	22	22	The wind will drive away all your shepherds . All those who were going to help you will be carried off as prisoners . Then you will be dishonored and put to shame . That will happen because you have been so sinful .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	2	‘ King of Judah , listen to the Lord ’ s message . You are sitting on David ’ s throne . You and your officials and your people come through these gates .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	3	The Lord says , “ Do what is fair and right . Save those who have been robbed . Set them free from the people who have treated them badly . Do not do anything wrong to outsiders or widows in this place . Do not harm children whose fathers have died . Do not kill those who are not guilty of doing anything wrong .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	4	Be careful to obey these commands . Then kings who sit on David ’ s throne will come through the gates of this palace . They will come riding in chariots and on horses . Their officials and their people will come along with them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	5	But suppose you do not obey these commands , ” announces the Lord . “ Then I promise you that this palace will be destroyed . You can be as sure of this promise as you are sure that I live. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	6	The Lord speaks about the palace of the king of Judah . He says , “ You are like the land of Gilead to me . You are like the highest mountain in Lebanon . But I will make you like a desert . You will become like towns that no one lives in .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	7	I will send destroyers against you . All of them will come with their weapons . They will cut up your fine cedar beams . They will throw them into the fire .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	8	“ People from many nations will pass by this city . They will ask one another , ‘ Why has the Lord done such a thing to this great city ? ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	9	And the answer will be , ‘ This happened because of what its people have done . They have turned away from the covenant the Lord their God made with them . They have worshiped other gods . And they have served them. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	10	Don ’ t weep over dead King Josiah . Don ’ t be sad because he ’ s gone . Instead , weep bitterly over King Jehoahaz . He was forced to leave his country . He will never return . He ’ ll never see his own land again .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	11	Jehoahaz became king of Judah after his father Josiah . But he has gone away from this place . That ’ s because the Lord says about him , “ He will never return .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	12	He will die in Egypt . That is where he was taken as a prisoner . He will not see this land again. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	13	The Lord says , “ How terrible it will be for King Jehoiakim ! He builds his palace by mistreating his people . He builds its upstairs rooms with money gained by sinning . He makes his own people work for nothing . He does not pay them for what they do .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	14	He says , ‘ I will build myself a great palace . It will have large rooms upstairs. ’ So he makes big windows in it . He covers its walls with cedar boards . He decorates it with red paint .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	15	“ Jehoiakim , does having more and more cedar boards make you a king ? Your father Josiah had enough to eat and drink . He did what was right and fair . So everything went well with him .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	16	He stood up for those who were poor or needy . So everything went well with him . That is what it means to know me , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	17	“ Jehoiakim , the only thing on your mind is to get rich by cheating others . You would even kill people who are not guilty of doing anything wrong . You would mistreat them . You would take everything they own. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	18	So the Lord speaks about King Jehoiakim , the son of Josiah . He says , “ His people will not mourn for him . They will not say , ‘ My poor brother ! My poor sister ! ’ They will not mourn for him . They will not say , ‘ My poor master ! How sad that his glory is gone ! ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	19	In fact , he will be buried like a donkey . His body will be dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	20	The Lord says , “ People of Jerusalem , go up to Lebanon . Cry out for help . Let your voice be heard in the land of Bashan . Cry out from the mountains of Abarim . All those who were going to help you are crushed .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	21	When you felt secure , I warned you . But you said , ‘ I won ’ t listen ! ’ You have acted like that ever since you were young . You have not obeyed me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	23	Some of you live in Jerusalem in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon . You are comfortable in your cedar buildings . But you will groan when pain comes on you . It will be like the pain of a woman having a baby .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	24	“ King Jehoiachin , you are the son of Jehoiakim , ” announces the Lord . “ Suppose you were a ring on my right hand . And suppose the ring even had my royal mark on it . Then I would still pull you off my finger . And that is just as sure as I am alive .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	25	I will hand you over to those who want to kill you . I will hand you over to people you are afraid of . I will give you to Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon . I will hand you over to his armies .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	26	I will throw you out into another country . I will throw your mother out . Neither of you was born in that country . But both of you will die there .
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	27	You will never come back to the land you long to return to. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	28	This man Jehoiachin is like a broken pot . Everyone hates him . No one wants him . Why will he and his children be thrown out of this land ? Why will they be sent to a land they don ’ t know about ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	29	Land , land , land , listen to the Lord ’ s message !
NIRV	Jeremiah	22	30	The Lord says , “ Let the record say that this man did not have any children . Let it report that he did not have any success in life . None of his children will have success either . None of them will sit on David ’ s throne . None of them will ever rule over Judah . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	23	23	“ Am I only a God who is nearby ? ” announces the Lord . “ Am I not a God who is also far away ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	2	So the Lord , the God of Israel , speaks to the shepherds who take care of my people . He tells them , “ You have scattered my sheep . You have driven them away . You have not taken good care of them . So I will punish you for the evil things you have done , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	3	“ I myself will gather together those who are left alive in my flock . I will gather them out of all the countries where I have driven them . And I will bring them back to their own land . There my sheep will have many lambs . There will be many more of them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	4	I will place shepherds over them who will take good care of them . My sheep will not be afraid or terrified anymore . And none of them will be missing , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	5	“ A new day is coming , ” announces the Lord . “ At that time I will raise up for David ’ s royal line a godly Branch . He will be a King who will rule wisely . He will do what is fair and right in the land .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	6	In his days Judah will be saved . Israel will live in safety . And the Branch will be called The Lord Who Makes Us Right With Himself .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	7	Other days are also coming , ” announces the Lord . “ At that time people will no longer say , ‘ The Lord brought the Israelites up out of Egypt . And that ’ s just as sure as he is alive. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	8	Instead , they will say , ‘ The Lord brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north . He gathered them out of all the countries where he had forced them to go . And that ’ s just as sure as he is alive. ’ Then they will live in their own land. ” Prophets Who Tell Lies
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	9	Here is my message about the prophets . My heart is broken inside me . All my bones tremble with fear . I am like a man who is drunk . I am like a strong man who has had too much wine . That ’ s what the Lord ’ s holy words have done to me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	10	The land is full of people who aren ’ t faithful to the Lord . Now the land is under his curse . And that ’ s why it is thirsty for water . That ’ s why the desert grasslands are dry . The prophets are leading sinful lives . They don ’ t use their power in the right way .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	11	“ Prophets and priests alike are ungodly , ” announces the Lord . “ Even in my temple I find them sinning .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	12	So their path will become slippery . They will be thrown out into darkness . There they will fall . I will bring trouble on them when the time to punish them comes , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	13	“ Among the prophets of Samaria I saw something I can ’ t stand . They were prophesying in the name of Baal . They were leading my people Israel astray .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	14	I have also seen something horrible among Jerusalem ’ s prophets . They are not faithful to me . They are not living by the truth . They strengthen the hands of those who do evil . So not one of them turns from their sinful ways . All of them are like the people of Sodom to me . They are just like the people of Gomorrah. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	15	So the Lord who rules over all speaks about the prophets . He says , “ I will make them eat bitter food . I will make them drink poisoned water . The prophets of Jerusalem have spread their ungodly ways all through the land. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	16	The Lord who rules over all says to the people of Judah , “ Do not listen to what the prophets are saying to you . They fill you with false hopes . They talk about visions that come from their own minds . What they say does not come from my mouth .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	17	They keep speaking to those who hate me . They say , ‘ The Lord says you will have peace. ’ They speak to all those who do what their stubborn hearts want them to do . They tell them , ‘ No harm will come to you. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	18	But which of them has ever stood in my courts ? Have they been there to see a vision or hear my message ? Who has listened and heard my message there ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	19	A storm will burst out because of my great anger . A windstorm will sweep down on the heads of sinful people .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	20	My anger will not turn back . I will accomplish everything I plan to do . In days to come you will understand it clearly .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	21	I did not send these prophets . But they have run to tell you their message anyway . I did not speak to them . But they have still prophesied .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	22	Suppose they had stood in my courts . Then they would have announced my message to my people . They would have turned my people from their evil ways . They would have turned them away from their sins .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	24	Who can hide in secret places so that I can ’ t see them ? ” announces the Lord . “ Don ’ t I fill heaven and earth ? ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	25	“ I have heard what the prophets are saying . They prophesy lies in my name . They say , ‘ I had a dream ! The Lord has given me a dream ! ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	26	How long will that continue in the hearts of these prophets who tell lies ? They try to get others to believe their own mistaken ideas .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	27	They tell one another their dreams . They think that will make my people forget my name . In the same way , their people of long ago forgot my name when they worshiped Baal .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	28	Let the prophet who has a dream describe the dream . But let the one who has my message speak it faithfully . Your prophets have given you straw to eat instead of grain , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	29	“ My message is like fire , ” announces the Lord . “ It is like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	30	“ So I am against these prophets , ” announces the Lord . “ I am against those who steal messages from one another . They claim that the messages come from me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	31	Yes , ” announces the Lord . “ I am against the prophets who speak their own words . But they still say , ‘ Here is what the Lord says. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	32	I am against prophets who talk about dreams that did not come from me , ” announces the Lord . “ They tell foolish lies . Their lies lead my people astray . But I did not send these prophets . I did not appoint them . They do not help my people in the least , ” announces the Lord . Prophets Who Give Messages That Are Not From the Lord
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	33	“ Jeremiah , these people might ask you a question . Or a prophet or priest might do this . They might ask , ‘ What message have you received from the Lord ? ’ Then tell them , ‘ You ask , “ What message ? ” Here it is . “ I will desert you , ” announces the Lord. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	34	A prophet or priest might make a claim . Or someone else might do this . He might claim , ‘ This is a message from the Lord. ’ Then I will punish them and their family .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	35	Here is what each of you people keeps on saying to your friends and other Israelites . You ask , ‘ What is the Lord ’ s answer ? ’ Or you ask , ‘ What has the Lord spoken ? ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	36	But you must not talk about ‘ a message from the Lord ’ again . That ’ s because each person ’ s own words become their message . And so you twist the Lord ’ s words . He is the living God . He is the Lord who rules over all . And he is our God .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	37	Here is what you keep saying to a prophet . You ask , ‘ What is the Lord ’ s answer to you ? ’ Or you ask , ‘ What has the Lord spoken ? ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	38	You claim , ‘ This is a message from the Lord. ’ But here is what the Lord says . ‘ You used the words , “ This is a message from the Lord. ” But I told you that you must not claim , “ This is a message from the Lord. ” ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	39	So you can be sure I will forget you . I will throw you out of my sight . I will also destroy the city I gave you and your people of long ago .
NIRV	Jeremiah	23	40	I will bring on you shame that will last forever . It will never be forgotten. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	24	24	King Jehoiachin was forced to leave Jerusalem . He was the son of Jehoiakim . Jehoiachin was taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon . The officials and all the skilled workers were forced to leave with him . After they left , the Lord showed me two baskets of figs . They were in front of his temple .
NIRV	Jeremiah	24	2	One basket had very good figs in it . They were like figs that ripen early . The other basket had very bad figs in it . In fact , they were so bad they couldn ’ t even be eaten .
NIRV	Jeremiah	24	3	Then the Lord asked me , “ What do you see , Jeremiah ? ” “ Figs , ” I answered . “ The good ones are very good . But the others are so bad they can ’ t be eaten. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	24	4	Then a message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	24	5	“ I am the Lord , the God of Israel . I say , ‘ I consider the people who were forced to leave Judah to be like these good figs . I sent them away from this place . I forced them to go to Babylon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	24	6	My eyes will watch over them . I will be good to them . And I will bring them back to this land . I will build them up . I will not tear them down . I will plant them . I will not pull them up by the roots .
NIRV	Jeremiah	24	7	I will change their hearts . Then they will know that I am the Lord . They will be my people . And I will be their God . They will return to me with all their heart .
NIRV	Jeremiah	24	8	“ ‘ But there are also bad figs . In fact , they are so bad they can ’ t be eaten , ’ says the Lord . ‘ Zedekiah , the king of Judah , is like these bad figs . So are his officials and the people of Jerusalem who are still left alive . I will punish them whether they remain in this land or live in Egypt .
NIRV	Jeremiah	24	9	I will make all the kingdoms on earth displeased with them . In fact , they will hate them a great deal . They will shake their heads at them . They will curse them and make fun of them . All this will happen no matter where I force them to go .
NIRV	Jeremiah	24	10	I will send war , hunger and plague against them . They will be destroyed from the land I gave them and their people of long ago. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	25	2	Jeremiah , the Lord ’ s prophet , spoke to all the people of Judah and Jerusalem . He said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	3	“ For

NIRV	Jeremiah	25	4	“ The Lord has sent all his servants the prophets to you . They ’ ve come to you again and again . But you haven ’ t listened . You haven ’ t paid any attention to them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	5	They said , ‘ Each of you must turn from your evil ways and practices . Then you can stay in the land forever . It ’ s the land the Lord gave you and your people of long ago .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	6	Don ’ t follow other gods . Don ’ t serve them or worship them . Don ’ t make the Lord angry with the gods your own hands have made . Then he won ’ t harm you. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	7	“ ‘ But you did not listen to me , ’ announces the Lord . ‘ You have made me very angry with the gods your hands have made . And you have brought harm on yourselves. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	8	“ The Lord who rules over all says , ‘ You have not listened to my words .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	9	So I will send for all the nations in the north . And I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon , ’ announces the Lord . ‘ I will bring all of them against this land and against you who live here . They will march out against all the nations that are around this land . I will set apart Judah and the nations around it in a special way to be destroyed . People will be shocked because of them . And they will make fun of them . Those nations will be destroyed forever .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	10	I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness . I will put an end to the voices of brides and grooms . The sound of grinding millstones will not be heard anymore . And lamps will not be lit anymore .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	11	This whole country will become dry and empty . And these nations will serve the king of Babylon for
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	70	years are over , ’ announces the Lord . ‘ I will make that land a desert forever .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	12	“ ‘ But I will punish that king and his nation because they are guilty . I will do this when the
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	13	I have spoken against that land . And I will make all these things happen to it . Everything will happen that is written in this book . And I will make everything Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations come true .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	14	The people of Babylon will become slaves of many other nations and great kings . I will pay them back for what they have done. ’ ” The Cup of God ’ s Great Anger
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	15	The Lord is the God of Israel . He said to me , “ Take this cup from my hand . It is filled with the wine of my great anger . Make all the nations to which I send you drink it .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	16	When they drink it , they will not even be able to walk straight . It will drive them out of their minds . I am going to send war against them. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	17	So I took the cup from the Lord ’ s hand . I made all the nations to which he sent me drink from it .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	18	He sent me to Judah ’ s kings and officials . He told me to go to Jerusalem and the towns of Judah . He wanted me to tell them they would be destroyed . Then people would be shocked because of them . They would make fun of them . They would use their name in a curse . And that ’ s how things still are today .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	19	Here is a list of the other kings and nations he sent me to . Pharaoh , the king of Egypt his attendants , his officials , all his people

NIRV	Jeremiah	25	26	all the kings in the north , near and far So he sent me to all the kingdoms on the face of the earth , one after the other . They will all drink from the cup of the Lord ’ s anger . After they drink , the king of Babylon will drink from it too .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	27	The Lord says , “ Tell them , ‘ The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , “ Drink from this cup . Get drunk and throw up . Fall down and do not get up again . I am going to send war against you. ” ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	28	But they might refuse to take the cup from your hand . They might not want to drink from it . Then tell them , ‘ The Lord who rules over all says , “ You must drink from it !
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	29	I am beginning to bring trouble on the city where I have put my Name . You might think you will not be punished . But you will certainly be punished . I am sending war against everyone who lives on earth , ” announces the Lord who rules over all. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	30	“ Jeremiah , prophesy against them . Tell them , “ ‘ The Lord will roar from heaven like a lion . His voice will sound like thunder from his holy temple there . He will roar loudly against his land . He will shout like those who stomp on grapes in winepresses . He will shout against everyone who lives on earth .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	31	The noise of battle will be heard from one end of the earth to the other . That ’ s because the Lord will bring charges against the nations . He will judge every human being . He will kill sinful people with his sword , ’ ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	32	The Lord who rules over all says , “ Look ! Horrible trouble is spreading from one nation to another . A mighty storm is rising . It is coming from a place that is very far away. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	33	At that time those the Lord kills will be lying around everywhere . They will be found from one end of the earth to the other . No one will mourn for them . Their dead bodies will not be gathered up or buried . Instead , they will be like human waste lying there on the ground .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	34	Weep and cry , you shepherds . Roll in the dust , you leaders of the flock . Your time to be killed has come . You will fall like the best of the rams .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	35	The shepherds won ’ t have any place to run to . The leaders of the flock won ’ t be able to escape .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	36	Listen to the cries of the shepherds . Hear the weeping of the leaders of the flock . The Lord is destroying their grasslands .
NIRV	Jeremiah	25	37	Their peaceful meadows will be completely destroyed because of the Lord ’ s great anger .

NIRV	Jeremiah	26	26	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . It was shortly after Jehoiakim became king of Judah . He was the son of Josiah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	2	The Lord said to Jeremiah , “ Stand in the courtyard of my house . Speak to the people of the towns in Judah . Speak to all those who come to worship in my house . Tell them everything I command you . Do not leave out a single word .
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	3	Perhaps they will listen . Maybe they will turn from their evil ways . Then I will not do what I said I would . I will not bring trouble on them . I had planned to punish them because of the evil things they had done .
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	4	Tell them , ‘ The Lord says , “ Listen to me . Obey my law that I gave you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	5	And listen to the words my servants the prophets are speaking . I have sent them to you again and again . But you have not listened to them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	6	So I will make this house like Shiloh . All the nations on earth will use the name of this city in a curse. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	7	Jeremiah spoke these words in the Lord ’ s house . The priests , the prophets and all the people heard him .
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	8	Jeremiah finished telling all the people everything the Lord had commanded him to say . But as soon as he did , the priests , the prophets and all the people grabbed him . They said , “ You must die !
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	9	Why do you prophesy these things in the Lord ’ s name ? Why do you say that this house will become like Shiloh ? Why do you say that this city will be empty and deserted ? ” And all the people crowded around Jeremiah in the Lord ’ s house .
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	10	The officials of Judah heard what had happened . So they went up from the royal palace to the Lord ’ s house . There they took their places at the entrance of the New Gate .
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	11	Then the priests and prophets spoke to the officials and all the people . They said , “ This man should be sentenced to death . He has prophesied against this city . You have heard it with your own ears ! ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	12	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and people . He said , “ The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and this city . He told me to say everything you have heard .
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	13	So change the way you live and act . Obey the Lord your God . Then he won ’ t do what he said he would . He won ’ t bring on you the trouble he said he would bring .
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	14	As for me , I ’ m in your hands . Do to me what you think is good and right .
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	15	But you can be sure of one thing . If you put me to death , you will be held responsible for spilling my blood . And I haven ’ t even done anything wrong . You will bring guilt on yourselves and this city and those who live in it . The Lord has sent me to you . He wanted me to say all these things so you could hear them . And that ’ s the truth. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	16	Then the officials and all the people spoke to the priests and prophets . They said , “ This man shouldn ’ t be sentenced to death ! He has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	17	Some of the elders of the land stepped forward . They spoke to the whole community gathered there . They said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	18	“ Micah from Moresheth prophesied . It was during the time Hezekiah was king over Judah . Micah spoke to all the people of Judah . He told them , ‘ The Lord who rules over all says , “ ‘ “ Zion will be plowed up like a field . Jerusalem will be turned into a pile of trash . The temple hill will be covered with bushes and weeds. ” ’ ( Micah 3:12 )
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	19	Did King Hezekiah or anyone else in Judah put Micah to death ? Hezekiah had respect for the Lord and tried to please him . And the Lord didn ’ t judge Jerusalem as he said he would . He didn ’ t bring on it the trouble he said he would bring . But we are about to bring horrible trouble on ourselves ! ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	20	Uriah was another man who prophesied in the name of the Lord . He was from Kiriath Jearim . He was the son of Shemaiah . Uriah prophesied against this city and this land . He said the same things Jeremiah did .
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	21	King Jehoiakim and all his officers and officials heard Uriah ’ s words . So the king decided to put him to death . But Uriah heard about it . He was afraid . And he ran away to Egypt .
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	22	So King Jehoiakim sent Elnathan to Egypt . He also sent some other men along with him . Elnathan was the son of Akbor .
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	23	Those men brought Uriah out of Egypt . They took him to King Jehoiakim . Then the king had Uriah struck down with a sword . He had Uriah ’ s body thrown into one of the graves of the ordinary people .
NIRV	Jeremiah	26	24	In spite of that , Ahikam stood up for Jeremiah . Ahikam was the son of Shaphan . Because of Ahikam , Jeremiah wasn ’ t handed over to the people to be put to death . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	27	27	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . It was shortly after Zedekiah became king of Judah . He was the son of Josiah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	2	The Lord said , “ Make a yoke out of ropes and wooden boards . Put it on your neck .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	3	Then write down a message for the kings of Edom , Moab , Ammon , Tyre and Sidon . Give it to their messengers who have come to Jerusalem . They have come to see Zedekiah , the king of Judah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	4	Give them a message for the kings who sent them . It should say , ‘ The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , “ Here is what I want you to tell your masters .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	5	I reached out my great and powerful arm . I made the earth . I made its people and animals . And I can give the earth to anyone I please .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	6	Now I will hand over all your countries to my servant Nebuchadnezzar . He is the king of Babylon . I will put even the wild animals under his control .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	7	All the nations will serve him and his son and grandson . After that , I will judge his land . Then many nations and great kings will make him serve them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	8	“ ‘ “ But suppose any nation or kingdom will not serve Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon . And suppose it refuses to put its neck under his yoke . Then I will punish that nation with war , hunger and plague , ” announces the Lord . “ I will punish it until his powerful hand destroys it .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	9	So do not listen to your prophets . Do not listen to those who claim to have secret knowledge . Do not listen to those who try to explain your dreams . Do not listen to those who get messages from people who have died . Do not listen to those who practice evil magic . All of them will tell you , ‘ You won ’ t serve the king of Babylon. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	10	But they prophesy lies to you . If you listen to them , you will be removed far away from your lands . I will drive you away from them . And you will die .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	11	But suppose any nation will put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon . And suppose it serves him . Then I will let that nation remain in its own land . I will let its people plow the land and live there , ” ’ ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	12	I gave the same message to Zedekiah , the king of Judah . I said , “ Put your neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon . Obey him . Serve his people . Then you will live .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	13	Why should you and your people die ? Why should you die of war , hunger and plague ? That ’ s what the Lord said would happen to any nation that won ’ t serve the king of Babylon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	14	Don ’ t listen to the words of the prophets who say to you , ‘ You won ’ t serve the king of Babylon. ’ They are prophesying lies to you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	15	‘ I have not sent them , ’ announces the Lord . ‘ They are prophesying lies in my name . So I will drive you away from your land . And you will die . So will the prophets who prophesy to you. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	16	Then I spoke to the priests and all these people . I said , “ The Lord says , ‘ Do not listen to the prophets who speak to you . They say , “ Very soon the objects from the Lord ’ s house will be brought back from Babylon. ” Those prophets are prophesying lies to you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	17	Do not listen to them . Serve the king of Babylon . Then you will live . Why should this city be destroyed ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	18	If they are prophets and have received a message from me , let them pray to me . I am the Lord who rules over all . Those prophets should pray that what is still in Jerusalem will remain here . They should pray that the objects in my house and the king ’ s palace will not be taken to Babylon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	19	I am the Lord who rules over all . Do you know what these objects are ? They include the two pillars in front of the temple . They include the huge bronze bowl . They include the bronze stands that can be moved around . And they include the other things left in this city .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	20	Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon , did not take these things away at first . That was when he took King Jehoiachin from Jerusalem to Babylon . Jehoiachin is the son of Jehoiakim . Nebuchadnezzar also took all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem along with Jehoiachin .
NIRV	Jeremiah	27	21	I am the Lord who rules over all . I am the God of Israel . Here is what will happen to the things that are left in my house , the king ’ s palace and Jerusalem .

NIRV	Jeremiah	28	3	Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon , removed all the objects that belong to my house . He took them to Babylon . Before two years are over , I will bring them back to this place .
NIRV	Jeremiah	28	4	I will also bring King Jehoiachin back . He is the son of Jehoiakim . And I will bring back all the others who were taken from Judah to Babylon , ’ announces the Lord . ‘ I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	28	5	Then Jeremiah the prophet replied to the false prophet Hananiah . Jeremiah spoke to him in front of the priests and all the people . They were standing in the Lord ’ s house .
NIRV	Jeremiah	28	6	Jeremiah said , “ Amen , Hananiah ! May the Lord do those things ! May he make the words you have prophesied come true . May he bring back from Babylon the objects that belong to the Lord ’ s house . May he bring back to this place all the people who were taken away .
NIRV	Jeremiah	28	7	But listen to what I have to say . I want you and all the people to hear it .
NIRV	Jeremiah	28	8	There have been prophets long before you and I were ever born . They have prophesied against many countries and great kingdoms . They have spoken about war , trouble and plague .
NIRV	Jeremiah	28	9	But what if a prophet says peace will come ? And suppose peace really does come ? Only then will he be recognized as a prophet truly sent by the Lord. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	28	10	The false prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet . Then Hananiah broke the yoke .
NIRV	Jeremiah	28	11	In front of all the people he said , “ The Lord says , ‘ In the same way , I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon . Before two years are over , I will remove it from the necks of all the nations. ’ ” When Jeremiah the prophet heard this , he went on his way .
NIRV	Jeremiah	28	12	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . It was after the false prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off Jeremiah ’ s neck . The message said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	28	13	“ Go . Tell Hananiah , ‘ The Lord says , “ You have broken a wooden yoke . But in its place you will get an iron yoke. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	28	14	The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , “ I will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations . I will make them serve Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon . So they will serve him . I will even give him control over the wild animals. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	28	15	Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke to the false prophet Hananiah . Jeremiah said , “ Listen , Hananiah ! The Lord hasn ’ t sent you . But you have tricked these people . Now they trust in lies .
NIRV	Jeremiah	28	16	So the Lord says , ‘ I am about to remove you from the face of the earth . Before this year is over , you will die . You have taught the people to turn against me. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	28	17	In the seventh month of that very year , the false prophet Hananiah died . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	29	29	But Zephaniah the priest read the letter to me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	2	It was sent to them after King Jehoiachin had been forced to leave Jerusalem . His mother and the court officials were taken with him . The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem had been forced to go to Babylon . All the skilled workers had also been forced to go .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	3	Jeremiah gave the letter to Elasah and Gemariah . Elasah was the son of Shaphan . Gemariah was the son of Hilkiah . Zedekiah , the king of Judah , had sent Elasah and Gemariah to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon . Here is what the letter said .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	4	The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He speaks to all those he forced to go from Jerusalem to Babylon . He says ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	5	“ Build houses and make your homes there . Plant gardens and eat what they produce .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	6	Get married . Have sons and daughters . Find wives for your sons . Give your daughters to be married . Then they too can have sons and daughters . Let there be many more of you and not fewer .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	7	Also work for the success of the city I have sent you to . Pray to the Lord for that city . If it succeeds , you too will enjoy success. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	8	The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , “ Do not let the prophets trick you . Do not be fooled by those who claim to have secret knowledge . Do not listen to people who try to explain their dreams to you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	9	All of them are prophesying lies to you in my name . I have not sent them , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	10	The Lord says , “ You will be forced to live in Babylon for
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	70	years . After they are over , I will come to you . My good promise to you will come true . I will bring you back home .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	11	I know the plans I have for you , ” announces the Lord . “ I want you to enjoy success . I do not plan to harm you . I will give you hope for the years to come .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	12	Then you will call out to me . You will come and pray to me . And I will listen to you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	13	When you look for me with all your heart , you will find me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	14	I will be found by you , ” announces the Lord . “ And I will bring you back from where you were taken as prisoners . I will gather you from all the nations . I will gather you from the places where I have forced you to go , ” announces the Lord . “ I will bring you back to the place I sent you away from. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	15	You might say , “ The Lord has given us prophets in Babylon. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	16	But here is what the Lord says about the king who now sits on David ’ s throne . He also says it about all the people who remain in this city . And he says it about all those who did not go with you to Babylon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	17	The Lord who rules over all says , “ I will send war , hunger and plague against them . I will make them like bad figs . They are so bad they can ’ t be eaten .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	18	I will hunt them down with war , hunger and plague . I will make all the kingdoms on earth displeased with them . They will use their name in a curse . All the nations where I drive them will be shocked at them . They will make fun of them . And they will bring shame on them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	19	That ’ s because they have not listened to my words , ” announces the Lord . “ I sent messages to them again and again . I sent them through my servants the prophets . And you who were taken to Babylon have not listened either , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	20	So listen to the Lord ’ s message . Listen , all you whom he has sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	21	The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He speaks about Ahab and Zedekiah . Ahab is the son of Kolaiah . Zedekiah is the son of Maaseiah . They are prophesying lies to you in my name . The Lord says about Ahab and Zedekiah , “ I will hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon . He will put them to death . You will see it with your own eyes .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	22	Because of what happens to them , people will use their names when they curse someone . All those who have been taken from Judah to Babylon will use their names in that way . They will say , ‘ May the Lord treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab . The king of Babylon burned them in the fire. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	23	That will happen because they have done awful things in Israel . They have committed adultery with their neighbors ’ wives . They have spoken lies in my name . I did not give them the authority to speak those things . I know what they have done . And I am a witness to it , ” announces the Lord . Shemaiah Opposes Jeremiah
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	24	Tell Shemaiah , the Nehelamite ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	25	“ The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , ‘ You sent letters in your own name to all the people in Jerusalem . You also sent them to Zephaniah the priest . He is the son of Maaseiah . And you sent them to all the other priests . You said to Zephaniah ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	26	“ The Lord has appointed you priest in place of Jehoiada . He has put you in charge of the Lord ’ s house . You are supposed to arrest any crazy person who claims to be a prophet . You should put him in prison . You should put iron bands around his neck .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	27	So why haven ’ t you punished Jeremiah from Anathoth ? He claims to be a prophet among you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	28	He has sent a message to us in Babylon . It says , ‘ You will be there a long time . So build houses and make your homes there . Plant gardens and eat what they produce. ’ ” ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	30	Then a message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	31	“ Send a message to all the people who were taken away . Tell them , ‘ The Lord speaks about Shemaiah , the Nehelamite . He says , “ Shemaiah has prophesied to you . But I did not send him . He has made you trust in lies .
NIRV	Jeremiah	29	32	So I say , ‘ I will certainly punish Shemaiah , the Nehelamite . I will also punish his children after him . He will not have any children left among these people . I will do good things for my people . But he will not see them , ’ ” ’ ” announces the Lord . “ ‘ “ ‘ That ’ s because he has taught people to turn against me. ’ ” ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	30	30	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	2	“ I am the Lord . I am the God of Israel . I say , ‘ Write in a book all the words I have spoken to you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	3	A new day is coming , ’ ” announces the Lord . “ ‘ At that time I will bring my people Israel and Judah back from where they have been taken as prisoners . I will bring them back to this land . I gave it to their people of long ago to have as their own , ’ ” says the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	4	Here are the words the Lord spoke about Israel and Judah . He said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	5	“ I am the Lord . I say , “ ‘ Cries of fear are heard . There is terror . There isn ’ t any peace .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	6	Ask and see . Can a man give birth to children ? Then why do I see every strong man with his hands on his stomach ? Each of them is acting like a woman having a baby . Every face is as pale as death .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	7	How awful that day will be ! No other day will be like it . It will be a time of trouble for the people of Jacob . But they will be saved out of it .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	8	“ ‘ At that time I will break the yoke off their necks , ’ announces the Lord who rules over all . ‘ I will tear off the ropes that hold them . People from other lands will not make them slaves anymore .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	9	Instead , they will serve me . And they will serve David their king . I will raise him up for them . I am the Lord their God .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	10	“ ‘ People of Jacob , do not be afraid . You are my servant . Israel , do not be terrified , ’ ” announces the Lord . “ ‘ You can be sure that I will save you . I will bring you out of a place far away . I will bring your children back from the land where they were taken . Your people will have peace and security again . And no one will make them afraid .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	11	I am with you . I will save you , ’ ” announces the Lord . “ ‘ I will completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you . But I will not completely destroy you . I will correct you . But I will be fair . I will not let you go without any punishment. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	12	The Lord says , “ Your wound can ’ t be cured . Your pain can ’ t be healed .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	13	No one will stand up for you . There isn ’ t any medicine for your sore . There isn ’ t any healing for you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	14	All those who were going to help you have forgotten you . They do not care about you . I have struck you as if I were your enemy . I have punished you as if I were very mean . That is because your guilt is so great . You have sinned so much .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	15	Why do you cry out about your wound ? Your pain can ’ t be healed . Your guilt is very great . And you have committed many sins . That is why I have done all these things to you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	16	“ But everyone who destroys you will be destroyed . All your enemies will be forced to leave their countries . Those who steal from you will be stolen from . I will take the belongings of those who take things from you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	17	But I will make you healthy again . I will heal your wounds , ” announces the Lord . “ That ’ s because you have been thrown out . You are called Zion , the one no one cares about. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	18	The Lord says , “ I will bless Jacob ’ s people with great success again . I will show tender love to Israel . Jerusalem will be rebuilt where it was destroyed . The palace will stand in its proper place .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	19	From those places the songs of people giving thanks will be heard . The sound of great joy will come from there . I will cause there to be more of my people . There will not be fewer of them . I will bring them honor . People will have respect for them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	20	Things will be as they used to be for Jacob ’ s people . I will make their community firm and secure . I will punish everyone who treats them badly .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	21	Their leader will be one of their own people . Their ruler will rise up from among them . I will bring him near . And he will come close to me . He will commit himself to serve me , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	22	“ So you will be my people . And I will be your God. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	30	23	A storm will burst out because of the Lord ’ s great anger . A strong wind will sweep down on the heads of evil people .

NIRV	Jeremiah	31	31	“ The days are coming , ” announces the Lord . “ I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel . I will also make it with the people of Judah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	2	The Lord says , “ Some of my people will live through everything their enemies do to them . They will find help in the desert . I will come to give peace and rest to Israel. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	3	The Lord appeared to us in the past . He said , “ I have loved you with a love that lasts forever . I have kept on loving you with a kindness that never fails .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	4	I will build you up again . Nation of Israel , you will be rebuilt . Once again you will use your tambourines to celebrate . You will go out and dance with joy .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	5	Once again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria . Farmers will plant them . They will enjoy their fruit .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	6	There will be a day when those on guard duty will cry out . They will stand on the hills of Ephraim . And they will shout , ‘ Come ! Let ’ s go up to Zion . Let ’ s go up to where the Lord our God is. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	7	The Lord says , “ Sing for joy because the people of Jacob are blessed . Shout because the Lord has made them the greatest nation . Make your praises heard . Say , ‘ Lord , save your people . Save the people who are left alive in Israel. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	8	I will bring them from the land of the north . I will gather them from one end of the earth to the other . Even those who are blind and those who can ’ t walk will be among them . Pregnant women and women having their babies will be among them also . Many of them will return .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	9	Their eyes will be filled with tears as they come . They will pray as I bring them back . I will lead them beside streams of water . I will lead them on a level path where they will not trip or fall . I am Israel ’ s father . And Ephraim is my oldest son .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	10	“ Listen to my message , you nations . Announce it on shores far away . Say , ‘ He who scattered Israel will gather them . He will watch over his flock like a shepherd. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	11	I will set the people of Jacob free . I will save them from those who are stronger than they are .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	12	They will come and shout for joy on Mount Zion . They will be joyful because of everything I give them . I give them grain , olive oil and fresh wine . I give them the young animals in their flocks and herds . Israel will be like a garden that has plenty of water . And they will not be sad anymore .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	13	Then young women will dance and be glad . And so will the men , young and old alike . I will turn their mourning into gladness . I will comfort them . And I will give them joy instead of sorrow .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	14	I will satisfy the priests . I will give them more than enough . And my people will be filled with the good things I give them , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	15	The Lord says , “ A voice is heard in Ramah . It is the sound of weeping and deep sadness . Rachel is weeping for her children . She refuses to be comforted , because they are gone. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	16	The Lord says , “ Do not weep anymore . Do not let tears fall from your eyes . I will reward you for your work , ” announces the Lord . “ Your children will return from the land of the enemy .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	17	So there is hope for your children , ” announces the Lord . “ Your children will return to their own land .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	18	“ I have heard the groans of Ephraim ’ s people . They say , ‘ You corrected us like a calf you were training . And we have been trained . Bring us back to you , and we will come back . You are the Lord our God .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	19	After we wandered away from you , we turned away from our sins . After we learned our lesson , we beat our chests in sorrow . We were full of shame . What we did when we were young brought dishonor on us. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	20	Aren ’ t the people of Ephraim my dear children ? Aren ’ t they the children I take delight in ? I often speak against them . But I still remember them . So my heart longs for them . I love them with a tender love , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	21	The Lord says , “ Put up road signs . Set up stones to show the way . Look carefully for the highway . Look for the road you will take . Return , people of Israel . Return to your towns .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	22	How long will you wander , my people Israel , who are not faithful to me ? I will create a new thing on earth . The woman will return to the man. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	23	The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , “ I will bring them back from the place where they were taken . Here is what the people in Judah and its towns will say once again . ‘ May the Lord bless you , you successful city . Sacred mountain , may he bless you. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	24	People will live together in Judah and all its towns . Farmers and shepherds will live there .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	25	I will give rest to those who are tired . I will satisfy those who are weak. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	26	When I heard this , I woke up and looked around . My sleep had been pleasant to me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	27	Here is what the Lord announces . “ The days are coming when I will plant the kingdoms of Israel and Judah again . I will plant them with children and young animals .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	28	I watched over Israel and Judah to pull them up by the roots . I tore them down . I crushed them . I destroyed them . I brought horrible trouble on them . But now I will watch over them to build them up and plant them , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	29	“ In those days people will no longer say , “ ‘ The parents have eaten sour grapes . But the children have a bitter taste in their mouths. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	30	Instead , everyone will die for their own sin . The one who eats sour grapes will taste how bitter they are .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	32	It will not be like the covenant I made with their people of long ago . That was when I took them by the hand . I led them out of Egypt . But they broke my covenant . They did it even though I was like a husband to them , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	33	“ This is the covenant I will make with Israel after that time , ” announces the Lord . “ I will put my law in their minds . I will write it on their hearts . I will be their God . And they will be my people .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	34	They will not need to teach their neighbor anymore . And they will not need to teach one another anymore . They will not need to say , ‘ Know the Lord. ’ That ’ s because everyone will know me . From the least important of them to the most important , all of them will know me , ” announces the Lord . “ I will forgive their evil ways . I will not remember their sins anymore. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	35	The Lord speaks . He makes the sun shine by day . He orders the moon and stars to shine at night . He stirs up the ocean . He makes its waves roar . His name is the Lord Who Rules Over All .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	36	“ Suppose my orders for creation disappear from my sight , ” announces the Lord . “ Only then will the people of Israel stop being a nation in my sight. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	37	The Lord says , “ Suppose the sky above could be measured . Suppose the foundations of the earth below could be completely discovered . Only then would I turn away the people of Israel . Even though they have committed many sins , I will still accept them , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	38	“ The days are coming , ” announces the Lord . “ At that time Jerusalem will be rebuilt for me . It will be rebuilt from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	39	The measuring line will reach out from there . It will go straight to the hill of Gareb . Then it will turn and reach as far as Goah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	31	40	There is a valley where dead bodies and ashes are thrown . That whole valley will be holy to me . The side of the Kidron Valley east of the city will be holy to me . It will be holy all the way to the corner of the Horse Gate . The city will never again be pulled up by the roots . It will never be destroyed. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	32	32	The people of Israel and Judah have made me very angry . They have done many evil things . They , their kings and officials have sinned . So have their priests and prophets . And the people of Judah and Jerusalem have also sinned .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	2	The armies of the king of Babylon were getting ready to attack Jerusalem . Jeremiah the prophet was being held as a prisoner . He was kept in the courtyard of the guard . It was part of Judah ’ s royal palace .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	3	Zedekiah , the king of Judah , had made Jeremiah a prisoner there . Zedekiah had said to him , “ Why do you prophesy as you do ? You say , ‘ The Lord says , “ I am about to hand over this city to the king of Babylon . He will capture it .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	4	Zedekiah , the king of Judah , will not escape from the powerful hands of the armies of Babylon . He will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon . Zedekiah will speak with him face to face . He will see him with his own eyes .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	5	Nebuchadnezzar will take Zedekiah to Babylon . Zedekiah will remain there until I deal with him , ” announces the Lord . “ Suppose you fight against the armies of Babylon . If you do , you will not succeed. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	6	Jeremiah said , “ A message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	7	‘ Hanamel is going to come to you . He is the son of your uncle Shallum . Hanamel will say , “ Buy my field at Anathoth . You are my closest relative . So it ’ s your right and duty to buy it. ” ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	8	“ Then my cousin Hanamel came to me . I was in the courtyard of the guard . It happened just as the Lord had said it would . Hanamel said , ‘ Buy my field at Anathoth . It is in the territory of Benjamin . It is your right to buy it and own it . So buy it for yourself. ’ “ I knew that this was the Lord ’ s message .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	9	So I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel . I weighed out seven ounces of silver for him .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	10	I signed and sealed the deed of purchase . I had some people witness everything . And I weighed out the silver on the scales .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	11	There were two copies of the deed . One was sealed and the other wasn ’ t . The deed included the terms and conditions of the sale .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	12	I gave Baruch the copies of the deed . My cousin Hanamel saw me do this . The witnesses who had signed the deed were there too . So were all the Jews who were sitting in the courtyard of the guard . Baruch was the son of Neriah . Neriah was the son of Mahseiah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	13	“ I gave Baruch directions in front of all of them . I said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	14	‘ The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , “ Take this deed of purchase . Take the sealed and unsealed copies . Put them in a clay jar . Then they will last a long time. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	15	The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , “ Houses , fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land. ” ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	16	“ I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch , the son of Neriah . Then I prayed to the Lord . I said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	17	“ ‘ Lord and King , you have reached out your great and powerful arm . You have made the heavens and the earth . Nothing is too hard for you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	18	You show your love to thousands of people . But you cause the sins of parents to affect even their children . Great and powerful God , your name is the Lord Who Rules Over All .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	19	Your purposes are great . Your acts are mighty . Your eyes see everything people do . You reward each one of them in keeping with their conduct . You do this based on what they have done .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	20	You performed signs and wonders in Egypt . And you have continued to do them to this day . You have done them in Israel and among all people . You are still known for doing them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	21	You brought your people Israel out of Egypt . You did it with signs and wonders . You reached out your mighty hand and powerful arm . You did great and wonderful things .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	22	You gave Israel this land that you promised to their people of long ago . It is a land that has plenty of milk and honey .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	23	Israel came in and took it over . But they did not obey you . They didn ’ t follow your law . They didn ’ t do what you commanded them to do . So you brought all this trouble on them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	24	“ ‘ See how ramps are built up against Jerusalem ’ s walls to attack it . The city will be handed over to the armies of Babylon . They are attacking it . It will fall because of war , hunger and plague . What you said would happen is now happening , as you can see .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	25	Lord and King , the city will be handed over to the armies of Babylon . In spite of that , you tell me to buy a field . You say , “ Pay for it with silver . And have the sale witnessed. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	26	Then a message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	27	“ I am the Lord . I am the God of all people . Is anything too hard for me ? ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	28	So the Lord says , “ I am about to hand this city over to the armies of Babylon . I will give it to Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon . He will capture it .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	29	The armies of Babylon are now attacking this city . They will come in and set it on fire . They will burn it down . They will burn down the houses where the people made me very angry . They burned incense on their roofs to the god named Baal . And they poured out drink offerings to other gods .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	30	“ The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in my eyes . They have done it since the nation was young . In fact , they have done nothing but make me very angry . They have worshiped statues of gods their own hands have made , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	31	“ This city has always stirred up my great anger . It has done it since the day it was built . Now I must remove it from my sight .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	33	They turned their backs to me . They would not face me . I taught them again and again . But they would not listen or pay attention when they were corrected .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	34	They set up the hateful statues of their gods . They did it in the house where I have put my Name . They made my house ‘ unclean. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	35	The people built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom . That is where they sacrifice their children to Molek in the fire . That is something I did not command . It did not even enter my mind . They did something I hate . They made Judah sin. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	36	Here is what you people of Judah are saying about this city . “ By war , hunger and plague it will be handed over to the king of Babylon. ” But here is what the Lord , the God of Israel , says .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	37	“ You can be sure that I will gather my people again . I will send them away when my burning anger blazes out against them . But I will bring them back to this place . And I will let them live in safety .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	38	They will be my people . And I will be their God .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	39	I will give them a single purpose in life . Then , they will always have respect for me . Then all will go well for them . And it will also go well for their children after them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	40	I will make a covenant with them that will last forever . I promise that I will never stop doing good to them . I will cause them to respect me . Then they will never turn away from me again .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	41	I will take pleasure in doing good things for them . I will certainly plant them in this land . I will do these things with all my heart and soul. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	42	The Lord says , “ I have brought all this horrible trouble on these people . But now I will give them all the good things I have promised them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	43	Once more fields will be bought in this land . It is the land about which you now say , ‘ It is a dry and empty desert . It doesn ’ t have any people or animals in it . It has been handed over to the armies of Babylon. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	32	44	Fields will be bought with silver . Deeds will be signed , sealed and witnessed . That will be done in the territory of Benjamin . It will be done in the villages around Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah . It will also be done in the towns of the central hill country . And it will be done in the towns of the western hills and the Negev Desert . I will bless their people with great success again , ” announces the Lord . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	33	33	Jeremiah was still being held as a prisoner . He was kept in the courtyard of the guard . Then another message from the Lord came to him . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	2	“ I made the earth . I formed it . And I set it in place . The Lord is my name .
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	3	Call out to me . I will answer you . I will tell you great things you do not know . And unless I do , you wouldn ’ t be able to find out about them. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	4	The Lord is the God of Israel . He speaks about the houses in Jerusalem . He talks about the royal palaces of Judah . The people had torn down many of them . They had used their stones to strengthen the city walls against attack .
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	5	That was during their fight with the armies of Babylon . The Lord says , “ The houses will be filled with dead bodies . They will be the bodies of the people I will kill . I will kill them when I am very angry with them . I will hide my face from this city . That ’ s because its people have committed so many sins .
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	6	“ But now I will bring health and healing to Jerusalem . I will heal my people . I will let them enjoy great peace and security .
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	7	I will bring Judah and Israel back from the places where they have been taken . I will build up the nation again . It will be just as it was before .
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	8	I will wash from its people all the sins they have committed against me . And I will forgive all the sins they committed when they turned away from me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	9	Then this city will bring me fame , joy , praise and honor . All the nations on earth will hear about the good things I do for this city . They will see the great success and peace I give it . Then they will be filled with wonder . And they will tremble with fear. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	10	The Lord says , “ You say about this place , ‘ It ’ s a dry and empty desert . It doesn ’ t have any people or animals in it. ’ The towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem are now deserted . So they do not have any people or animals living in them . But happy sounds will be heard there once more .
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	11	They will be the sounds of joy and gladness . The voices of brides and grooms will fill the streets . And the voices of those who bring thank offerings to my house will be heard there . They will say , “ ‘ Give thanks to the Lord who rules over all , because he is good . His faithful love continues forever. ’ That ’ s because I will bless this land with great success again . It will be as it was before , ” says the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	12	The Lord who rules over all says , “ This place is a desert . It does not have any people or animals in it . But there will again be grasslands near all its towns . Shepherds will rest their flocks there .
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	13	Flocks will again pass under the hands of shepherds as they count their sheep , ” says the Lord . “ That will be done in the towns of the central hill country . It will be done in the western hills and the Negev Desert . It will be done in the territory of Benjamin . And it will be done in the villages around Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	14	“ The days are coming , ” announces the Lord . “ At that time I will fulfill my good promise to my people . I made it to the people of Israel and Judah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	15	“ Here is what I will do in those days and at that time . I will make a godly Branch grow from David ’ s royal line . He will do what is fair and right in the land .
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	16	In those days Judah will be saved . Jerusalem will live in safety . And it will be called The Lord Who Makes Us Right With Himself. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	17	The Lord says , “ David will always have a son to sit on the throne of Israel .
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	18	The priests , who are Levites , will always have a man to serve me . He will sacrifice burnt offerings . He will burn grain offerings . And he will offer sacrifices. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	19	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	20	The Lord said , “ Could you ever break my covenant with the day ? Could you ever break my covenant with the night ? Could you ever stop day and night from coming at their appointed times ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	21	Only then could my covenant with my servant David be broken . Only then could my covenant with the Levites who serve me as priests be broken . Only then would David no longer have someone from his family line to rule on his throne .
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	22	Here is what I will do for my servant David . And here is what I will do for the Levites who serve me . I will make their children after them as many as the stars in the sky . And I will make them as many as the grains of sand on the seashore . It will be impossible to count them. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	23	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	24	“ Haven ’ t you noticed what these people are saying ? They say , ‘ The Lord once chose the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah . But now he has turned his back on them. ’ So they hate my people . They do not think of them as a nation anymore .
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	25	I say , ‘ What if I had not made my covenant with day and night ? What if I had not established the laws of heaven and earth ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	33	26	Only then would I turn my back on the children of Jacob and my servant David . Only then would I not choose one of David ’ s sons to rule over the children of Abraham , Isaac and Jacob . But I will bless my people with great success again . I will love them with tender love. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	34	34	Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon , and all his armies were fighting against Jerusalem . They were also fighting against all the towns around it . All the kingdoms and nations Nebuchadnezzar ruled over were helping him . At that time a message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	2	“ I am the Lord , the God of Israel . Go to Zedekiah , the king of Judah . Tell him , ‘ The Lord says , “ I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon . He will burn it down .
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	3	You will not escape from his power . You will certainly be captured . You will be handed over to him . You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes . He will speak with you face to face . And you will go to Babylon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	4	“ ‘ “ But listen to the Lord ’ s promise to you , Zedekiah king of Judah . I say that you will not be killed by a sword .
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	5	You will die in a peaceful way . People made fires to honor the kings who died before you . In the same way , they will make a fire in your honor . They will mourn for you . They will say , ‘ My poor master ! ’ I myself make this promise , ” announces the Lord. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	6	Then Jeremiah the prophet told all this to King Zedekiah in Jerusalem .
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	7	At that time Nebuchadnezzar ’ s armies were fighting against Jerusalem . They were also fighting against Lachish and Azekah . These two cities were still holding out . They were the only cities left in Judah that had high walls around them . The People Set Their Slaves Free
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	8	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem . He had told them to set their Hebrew slaves free .
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	9	All of them had to do this . That applied to male and female slaves alike . No one was allowed to hold another Hebrew as a slave .
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	10	So all the officials and people entered into this covenant . They agreed to set their male and female slaves free . They agreed not to hold them as slaves anymore . Instead , they set them free .
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	11	But later they changed their minds . They took back the people they had set free . They made them slaves again .
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	12	Then a message from the Lord came to Jeremiah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	13	The Lord is the God of Israel . He says , “ I made a covenant with your people of long ago . I brought them out of Egypt . That is the land where they were slaves . I said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	14	‘ Every seventh year you must set your people free . Each of you must set free all the Hebrews who have sold themselves to you . Let them serve you for six years . Then you must let them go free. ’ ( Deuteronomy 15:12 ) But your people of long ago did not listen to me . They did not pay any attention to me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	15	Recently you turned away from your sins . You did what is right in my eyes . Each of you set your Hebrew slaves free . You even made a covenant in front of me . You did it in the house where I have put my Name .
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	16	But now you have turned around . You have treated my name as if it were not holy . Each of you has taken back your male and female slaves . You had set them free to go where they wished . But now you have forced them to become your slaves again. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	17	So the Lord says , “ You have not obeyed me . You have not set your Hebrew slaves free . So now I will set you free , ” announces the Lord . “ I will set you free to be destroyed by war , plague and hunger . I will make all the kingdoms on earth displeased with you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	18	Those people who have broken my covenant will be punished . They have not lived up to the terms of the covenant they made in front of me . When you made that covenant , you cut a calf in two . Then you walked between its pieces . Now I will cut you to pieces .
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	19	That includes all of you who walked between the pieces of the calf . It includes the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem , the court officials and the priests . It also includes some of the people of the land .
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	20	So I will hand over all those people to their enemies who want to kill them . Their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals .
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	21	“ I will hand over King Zedekiah and his officials to their enemies . I will hand them over to those who want to kill them . I will hand them over to the armies of the king of Babylon . They have now pulled back from you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	34	22	But I am going to give an order , ” announces the Lord . “ I will bring them back to this city . They will fight against it . They will capture it and burn it down . And I will completely destroy the towns of Judah . No one will be able to live there. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	35	35	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . It came during the time Jehoiakim was king over Judah . Jehoiakim was the son of Josiah . The message said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	2	“ Go to the members of the family line of Rekab . Invite them to come to one of the side rooms in my house . Then give them wine to drink. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	3	So I went to get Jaazaniah . He was the son of Jeremiah . Jeremiah was the son of Habazziniah . I also went to get Jaazaniah ’ s brothers and all his sons . That included all the members of the family line of Rekab .
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	4	I brought them into the Lord ’ s house . I took them into the room of the sons of Hanan . He was the son of Igdaliah . He was also a man of God . His room was next to the room of the officials . Their room was above the room of Maaseiah . He was the son of Shallum . He also was one of those who guarded the temple doors .
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	5	Then I got bowls full of wine and some cups . I set them down in front of the men from the family line of Rekab . I said to them , “ Drink some wine. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	6	But they replied , “ We don ’ t drink wine . That ’ s because Jehonadab gave us a command . He was the son of Rekab . He was also one of our own people from long ago . He commanded , ‘ You and your children after you must never drink wine .
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	7	Also you must never build houses . You must never plant crops or vineyards . You must never have any of these things . Instead , you must always live in tents . Then you will live a long time in the land where you are wandering around. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	8	We have done everything Jehonadab , the son of Rekab , commanded us to do . So we and our wives and our children have never drunk wine .
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	9	We have never built houses to live in . We ’ ve never had vineyards , fields or crops .
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	10	We ’ ve always lived in tents . We ’ ve completely obeyed everything Jehonadab commanded our people of long ago .
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	11	But Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon , marched into this land . Then we said , ‘ Come . We must go to Jerusalem . There we can escape the armies of Babylon and Aram. ’ So we have remained in Jerusalem. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	12	Then a message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . It said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	13	“ The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , ‘ Go . Speak to the people of Judah and Jerusalem . Tell them , “ Won ’ t you ever learn a lesson ? Won ’ t you ever obey my words ? ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	14	“ Jehonadab , the son of Rekab , ordered his children not to drink wine . And they have kept his command . To this day they do not drink wine . They obey the command Jehonadab gave their people long ago . But I have spoken to you again and again . In spite of that , you have not obeyed me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	15	Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you . They said , ‘ Each of you must turn from your evil ways . You must change the way you act . Do not worship other gods . Do not serve them . Then you will live in the land . I gave it to you and your people of long ago. ’ But you have not paid any attention . You have not listened to me .
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	16	The children of Jehonadab , the son of Rekab , have obeyed the command Jehonadab gave them long ago . But the people of Judah have not obeyed me. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	17	So the Lord God who rules over all speaks . The God of Israel says , “ Listen ! I am going to bring horrible trouble on Judah . I will also bring it on everyone who lives in Jerusalem . I will bring on them every trouble I said I would . I spoke to them . But they did not listen . I called out to them . But they did not answer. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	18	Then Jeremiah spoke to the members of the family line of Rekab . Jeremiah said , “ The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , ‘ You have obeyed the command Jehonadab gave your people of long ago . You have followed all his directions . You have done everything he ordered. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	35	19	So the Lord who rules over all speaks . The God of Israel says , ‘ Jehonadab , the son of Rekab , will always have someone from his family line to serve me. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	36	36	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . It came in the fourth year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah . He was the son of Josiah . The message said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	2	“ Get a scroll . Write on it all the words I have spoken to you . Write down what I have said about Israel , Judah and all the other nations . Write what I have said to you from the time of King Josiah until now .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	3	The people of Judah will hear about all the trouble I plan to bring on them . Maybe then each of them will turn from their evil ways . If they do , I will forgive their sins and the evil things they have done. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	4	So Jeremiah sent for Baruch , the son of Neriah . Jeremiah told him to write down all the words the Lord had spoken to him . And Baruch wrote them on the scroll .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	5	Then Jeremiah said to him , “ I ’ m not allowed to go to the Lord ’ s temple .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	6	So you go there . Go on a day when the people are fasting . Read to them from the scroll . Read the words of the Lord you wrote down as I gave them to you . Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	7	They will hear what the Lord will do to them when his burning anger blazes out against them . Then perhaps they will pray to him . And maybe each of them will turn from their evil ways. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	8	Baruch , the son of Neriah , did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do . He went to the Lord ’ s temple . There he read the words of the Lord from the scroll .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	9	It was in the fifth year that Jehoiakim , the son of Josiah , was king of Judah . It was the ninth month of that year . A time of fasting at the Lord ’ s temple had been ordered . All the people in Jerusalem were told to take part in it . So were those who had come in from the towns of Judah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	10	Baruch read to all the people who were at the Lord ’ s temple . He read Jeremiah ’ s words from the scroll . He was in the room of Gemariah the secretary . It was located in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple . Gemariah was the son of Shaphan .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	11	Micaiah was the son of Gemariah , the son of Shaphan . Micaiah heard Baruch reading all the Lord ’ s words that were written on the scroll .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	12	Then he went down to the secretary ’ s room in the royal palace . All the officials were sitting there . They included the secretary Elishama and Delaiah , the son of Shemaiah . Elnathan , the son of Akbor , was also there . So was Gemariah , the son of Shaphan . Zedekiah , the son of Hananiah , was there too . And so were all the other officials .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	13	Micaiah told all of them what he had heard . He told them everything Baruch had read to the people from the scroll .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	14	All the officials sent Jehudi to speak to Baruch , the son of Neriah . Jehudi was the son of Nethaniah . Nethaniah was the son of Shelemiah . Shelemiah was the son of Cushi . Jehudi said to Baruch , “ Come . Bring the scroll you have read to the people. ” So Baruch went to them . He carried the scroll with him .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	15	The officials said to him , “ Please sit down . Read the scroll to us. ” So Baruch read it to them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	16	They heard all its words . Then they looked at one another in fear . They said to Baruch , “ We must report all these words to the king. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	17	They said to Baruch , “ Tell us . How did you happen to write all these things ? Did Jeremiah tell you to do this ? ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	18	“ Yes , ” Baruch replied . “ He told me to write down all these words . So I wrote them in ink on the scroll. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	19	Then the officials spoke to Baruch . They said , “ You and Jeremiah must go and hide . Don ’ t let anyone know where you are. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	20	The officials put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary . Then they went to the king in the courtyard . They reported everything to him .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	21	The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll . Jehudi brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary . Jehudi read it to the king . All the officials were standing beside the king . So they heard it too .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	22	It was the ninth month . The king was sitting in his winter apartment . A fire was burning in the fire pot in front of him .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	23	Jehudi read three or four sections from the scroll . Then the king cut them off with a secretary ’ s knife . He threw them into the fire pot . He did that until the entire scroll was burned up in the fire .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	24	The king and some of his attendants heard all these words . But they weren ’ t afraid . They didn ’ t tear their clothes .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	25	Elnathan , Delaiah and Gemariah begged the king not to burn the scroll . But he wouldn ’ t listen to them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	26	Instead , the king commanded three men to arrest Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet . But the Lord had hidden them . The three men were Jerahmeel , Seraiah and Shelemiah . Jerahmeel was a member of the royal court . Seraiah was the son of Azriel . And Shelemiah was the son of Abdeel .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	27	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . It came after the king burned the scroll . On the scroll were the words Baruch had written down . Jeremiah had told him to write them . The message said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	28	“ Get another scroll . Write on it all the words that were on the first one . King Jehoiakim burned that one up .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	29	Also tell King Jehoiakim , ‘ The Lord says , “ You burned that scroll . You said to Baruch , ‘ Why did you write that the king of Babylon would certainly come ? Why did you write that he would destroy this land ? And why did you write that he would remove from it people and animals alike ? ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	30	So now the Lord has something to say about Jehoiakim , the king of Judah . He says , “ No one from Jehoiakim ’ s family line will sit on David ’ s throne . Jehoiakim ’ s body will be thrown out . It will lie outside in the heat by day and in the frost at night .
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	31	I will punish him and his children and his attendants . I will punish them for their sinful ways . I will bring on them all the trouble I said I would . And I will bring it on the people of Jerusalem and Judah . They have not listened to me. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	36	32	So Jeremiah got another scroll . He gave it to Baruch the secretary . He was the son of Neriah . Jeremiah told Baruch what to write on it . Baruch wrote down all the words that were on the scroll King Jehoiakim had burned up in the fire . And many more words were written on it . They were similar to those that had already been written .

NIRV	Jeremiah	37	37	Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon , appointed Zedekiah to be king of Judah . He was the son of Josiah . Zedekiah ruled in place of Jehoiachin , the son of Jehoiakim .
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	2	Zedekiah and his attendants didn ’ t pay any attention to what the Lord had said through Jeremiah the prophet . And the people of the land didn ’ t pay any attention either .
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	3	But King Zedekiah sent Jehukal to Jeremiah the prophet . Zedekiah sent Zephaniah the priest along with him . Jehukal was the son of Shelemiah . Zephaniah was the son of Maaseiah . Jehukal and Zephaniah brought the king ’ s message to Jeremiah . It said , “ Please pray to the Lord our God for us. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	4	At that time Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people . Jeremiah had not yet been put in prison .
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	5	The armies of Babylon were attacking Jerusalem . They received a report that Pharaoh ’ s army had marched out of Egypt to help Zedekiah . So armies of Babylon pulled back from Jerusalem .
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	6	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	7	The Lord is the God of Israel . He says , “ The king of Judah has sent you to ask me for advice . Tell him , ‘ Pharaoh ’ s army has marched out to help you . But it will go back to its own land . It will return to Egypt .
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	8	Then the armies of Babylon will come back here . They will attack this city . They will capture it . Then they will burn it down. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	9	“ The Lord says , ‘ Do not fool yourselves . You think , “ The Babylonians will leave us alone. ” But they will not !
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	10	Suppose you destroy all the armies of Babylon that are attacking you . Suppose only wounded men are left in their tents . Even then they will come out and burn down this city. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	11	The armies of Babylon had pulled back from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh ’ s army .
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	12	So Jeremiah started to leave the city . He was planning to go to the territory of Benjamin . Jeremiah wanted to get his share of the property among the people there .
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	13	He got as far as the Benjamin Gate . But the captain of the guard arrested him . He said , “ You are going over to the side of the Babylonians ! ” The captain ’ s name was Irijah , the son of Shelemiah . Shelemiah was the son of Hananiah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	14	Jeremiah said to Irijah , “ That isn ’ t true ! I ’ m not going to the side of the Babylonians. ” But Irijah wouldn ’ t listen to him . Instead , he arrested Jeremiah . He brought Jeremiah to the officials .
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	15	They were angry with him . So they had him beaten . Then they took him to the house of Jonathan the secretary . It had been made into a prison . That ’ s where they put Jeremiah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	16	Jeremiah was put into a prison cell below ground level . He remained there a long time .
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	17	Then King Zedekiah sent for him . King Zedekiah had Jeremiah brought to the palace . There the king spoke to him in private . The king asked , “ Do you have a message from the Lord for me ? ” “ Yes , ” Jeremiah replied . “ You will be handed over to the king of Babylon. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	18	Then Jeremiah continued , “ Why have you put me in prison ? What crime have I committed against you ? What have I done to your attendants or these people ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	19	Where are your prophets who prophesied to you ? They said , ‘ The king of Babylon won ’ t attack you . He won ’ t march into this land. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	20	But now please listen , my king and master . Let me make my appeal to you . Please don ’ t send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary . If you do , I ’ ll die there. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	37	21	Then King Zedekiah gave the order . His men put Jeremiah in the courtyard of the guard . They gave him a loaf of bread from the street of the bakers . They did it every day until all the bread in the city was gone . So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	38	2	“ The Lord says , ‘ Those who stay in this city will die of war , hunger or plague . But those who go over to the side of the Babylonians will live . They will escape with their lives . They will remain alive. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	3	The Lord also says , ‘ This city will certainly be handed over to the armies of the king of Babylon . They will capture it. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	4	Then these officials said to the king , “ This man should be put to death . What he says is making the soldiers who are left in this city lose hope . It ’ s making all the people lose hope too . He isn ’ t interested in what is best for the people . In fact , he ’ s trying to destroy them. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	5	“ He ’ s in your hands , ” King Zedekiah answered . “ I can ’ t do anything to oppose you. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	6	So they took Jeremiah and put him into an empty well . It belonged to Malkijah . He was a member of the royal court . His well was in the courtyard of the guard . Zedekiah ’ s men lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the well . It didn ’ t have any water in it . All it had was mud . And Jeremiah sank down into the mud .
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	7	Ebed-Melek was an official in the royal palace . He was from the land of Cush . He heard that Jeremiah had been put into the well . The king was sitting by the Benjamin Gate at that time .
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	8	Ebed-Melek went out of the palace . He said to the king ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	9	“ My king and master , everything these men have done to Jeremiah the prophet is evil . They have thrown him into an empty well . Soon there won ’ t be any more bread in the city . Then he ’ ll starve to death. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	10	So the king gave an order to Ebed-Melek the Cushite . He said , “ Take with you
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	30	men from here . Lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the well before he dies. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	11	Then Ebed-Melek took the men with him . He went to a room in the palace . It was under the place where the treasures were stored . He got some old rags and worn-out clothes from there . Then he let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the well .
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	12	Ebed-Melek the Cushite told Jeremiah what to do . Ebed-Melek said , “ Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms . They ’ ll pad the ropes. ” So Jeremiah did .
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	13	Then the men pulled him up with the ropes . They lifted him out of the well . And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard . Zedekiah Questions Jeremiah Again
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	14	Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet . The king had him brought to the third entrance to the Lord ’ s temple . “ I want to ask you something , ” the king said to Jeremiah . “ Don ’ t hide anything from me. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	15	Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , “ Suppose I give you an answer . You will kill me , won ’ t you ? Suppose I give you good advice . You won ’ t listen to me , will you ? ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	16	But King Zedekiah promised Jeremiah secretly , “ I won ’ t kill you . And I won ’ t hand you over to those who want to kill you . That ’ s just as sure as the Lord is alive . He ’ s the one who has given us breath. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	17	So Jeremiah said to Zedekiah , “ The Lord God who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , ‘ Give yourself up to the officers of the king of Babylon . Then your life will be spared . And this city will not be burned down . You and your family will remain alive .
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	18	But what if you do not give yourself up to them ? Then this city will be handed over to the Babylonians . They will burn it down . And you yourself will not escape from them. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	19	King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah , “ I ’ m afraid of some of the Jews . They are the ones who have gone over to the side of the Babylonians . The Babylonians might hand me over to them . And those Jews will treat me badly. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	20	“ They won ’ t hand you over to them , ” Jeremiah replied . “ Obey the Lord . Do what I tell you to do . Then things will go well with you . Your life will be spared .
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	21	Don ’ t refuse to give yourself up . The Lord has shown me what will happen if you do .
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	22	All the women who are left in your palace will be brought out . They ’ ll be given to the officials of the king of Babylon . Those women will say to you , “ ‘ Your trusted friends have tricked you . They have gotten the best of you . Your feet are sunk down in the mud . Your friends have deserted you. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	23	“ All your wives and children will be brought out to the Babylonians . You yourself won ’ t escape from them . You will be captured by the king of Babylon . And this city will be burned down. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	24	Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah , “ Don ’ t let anyone know about the talk we ’ ve had . If you do , you might die .
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	25	Suppose the officials find out that I ’ ve talked with you . And suppose they come to you and say , ‘ Tell us what you said to the king . Tell us what the king said to you . Don ’ t hide it from us . If you do , we ’ ll kill you. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	26	Then tell them , ‘ I was begging the king not to send me back to Jonathan ’ s house . I don ’ t want to die there. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	27	All the officials came to Jeremiah . And they questioned him . He told them everything the king had ordered him to say . None of them had heard what he told the king . So they didn ’ t say anything else to him .
NIRV	Jeremiah	38	28	Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard . He stayed there until the day Jerusalem was captured . Jerusalem Is Destroyed Here is how Jerusalem was captured . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	39	39	""
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	1	Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon , marched out against Jerusalem . He came with all his armies and attacked it . It was in the ninth year that Zedekiah was king of Judah . It was in the tenth month .
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	2	The city wall was broken through . It happened on the ninth day of the fourth month . It was in the 11th year of Zedekiah ’ s rule .
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	3	All the officials of the king of Babylon came . They took seats near the Middle Gate . Nergal-Sharezer from Samgar was there . Nebo-Sarsekim , a chief officer , was also there . So was Nergal-Sharezer , a high official . And all the other officials of the king of Babylon were there too .
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	4	King Zedekiah and all the soldiers saw them . Then they ran away . They left the city at night . They went by way of the king ’ s garden . They went out through the gate between the two walls . And they headed toward the Arabah Valley .
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	5	But the armies of Babylon chased them . They caught up with Zedekiah in the plains near Jericho . They captured him there . And they took him to Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon . He was at Riblah in the land of Hamath . That ’ s where Nebuchadnezzar decided how Zedekiah would be punished .
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	6	The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah . He forced Zedekiah to watch it with his own eyes . He also killed all the nobles of Judah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	7	Then he poked out Zedekiah ’ s eyes . He put him in bronze chains . And he took him to Babylon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	8	The Babylonians set the royal palace on fire . They also set fire to the houses of the people . And they broke down the walls of Jerusalem .
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	9	Nebuzaradan was commander of the royal guard . Some people still remained in the city . But he took them away to Babylon as prisoners . He also took along those who had gone over to his side . And he took the rest of the people .
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	10	Nebuzaradan , the commander of the guard , left some of the poor people of Judah behind . They didn ’ t own anything . So at that time he gave them vineyards and fields .
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	11	Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon , had given orders about Jeremiah . He had given them to Nebuzaradan , the commander of the royal guard . Nebuchadnezzar had said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	12	“ Take him . Look after him . Don ’ t harm him . Do for him anything he asks. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	13	So that ’ s what Nebuzaradan , the commander of the guard , did . Nebushazban and Nergal-Sharezer were with him . So were all the other officers of the king of Babylon . Nebushazban was a chief officer . Nergal-Sharezer was a high official . All these men
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	14	sent for Jeremiah . They had him taken out of the courtyard of the guard . They turned him over to Gedaliah . Gedaliah was the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan . They told Gedaliah to take Jeremiah back to his home . So Jeremiah remained among his own people .
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	15	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . It came while he was being kept in the courtyard of the guard . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	16	“ Go . Speak to Ebed-Melek the Cushite . Tell him , ‘ The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , “ I am about to make the words I spoke against this city come true . I will not give success to it . Instead , I will bring horrible trouble on it . At that time my words will come true . You will see it with your own eyes .
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	17	But I will save you on that day , ” announces the Lord . “ You will not be handed over to those you are afraid of .
NIRV	Jeremiah	39	18	I will save you . You will not be killed by a sword . Instead , you will escape with your life . That ’ s because you trust in me , ” announces the Lord. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	40	40	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . It came after Nebuzaradan , the commander of the royal guard , had set him free at Ramah . Jeremiah was being held by chains when Nebuzaradan found him . Jeremiah was among all the prisoners from Jerusalem and Judah . They were being taken to Babylon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	40	2	But the commander of the guard found Jeremiah . The commander said to him , “ The Lord your God ordered that this place be destroyed .
NIRV	Jeremiah	40	3	And now he has brought it about . He has done exactly what he said he would do . All these things have happened because you people sinned against the Lord . You didn ’ t obey him .
NIRV	Jeremiah	40	4	But today I ’ m setting you free from the chains on your wrists . Come with me to Babylon if you want to . I ’ ll take good care of you there . But if you don ’ t want to come , then don ’ t . The whole country lies in front of you . Go anywhere you want to. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	40	5	But before Jeremiah turned to go , Nebuzaradan continued , “ Go back to Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam . The king of Babylon has appointed Gedaliah to be over the towns of Judah . Go and live with him among your people . Or go anywhere else you want to. ” Ahikam was the son of Shaphan . The commander gave Jeremiah food and water . He also gave him a gift . Then he let Jeremiah go .
NIRV	Jeremiah	40	6	So Jeremiah went to Mizpah to see Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam . Jeremiah stayed with him . Jeremiah lived among the people who were left behind in the land . Gedaliah Is Murdered
NIRV	Jeremiah	40	7	Some of Judah ’ s army officers and their men were still in the open country . They heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor over Judah . Gedaliah was the son of Ahikam . The king had put Gedaliah in charge of the men , women and children who were still there . They were the poorest people in the land . They hadn ’ t been taken to Babylon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	40	8	When the army officers and their men heard these things , they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah . Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , came . So did Johanan and Jonathan , the sons of Kareah . Seraiah , the son of Tanhumeth , also came . The sons of Ephai from Netophah came too . And so did Jaazaniah , the son of the Maakathite . All their men came with them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	40	9	Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan , made a promise . He made the promise to give hope to all these men . He spoke in a kind way to them . He said , “ Don ’ t be afraid to serve the Babylonians . Make your homes in the land of Judah . Serve the king of Babylon . Then things will go well with you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	40	10	I myself will stay at Mizpah . I ’ ll speak for you to the officials of Babylon who come to us . But you must harvest the wine , summer fruit and olive oil . Put them in your jars . Store them up . And live in the towns you have taken over. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	40	11	All the Jews in Moab , Ammon and Edom heard what had happened . So did the Jews in all the other countries . They heard that the king of Babylon had left some people behind in Judah . They also heard that he had appointed Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam , as governor over them . Ahikam was the son of Shaphan .
NIRV	Jeremiah	40	12	When they heard these things , all of them came back to the land of Judah . They went to Gedaliah at Mizpah . They came from all the countries where they had been scattered . And they harvested a large amount of wine and summer fruit .
NIRV	Jeremiah	40	13	Johanan and all the other army officers still in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah . Johanan was the son of Kareah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	40	14	The officers spoke to Gedaliah . They said , “ Don ’ t you know that Baalis has sent someone to take your life ? Baalis is the king of Ammon . He has sent Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah. ” But Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam , didn ’ t believe them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	40	15	Then Johanan , the son of Kareah , spoke in private to Gedaliah in Mizpah . He said , “ Let me go and kill Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah . No one will know about it . Why should he take your life ? Why should he cause all the Jews gathered around you to be scattered ? Why should he cause the people who remain in Judah to die ? ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	40	16	But Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam , spoke to Johanan , the son of Kareah . He said , “ Don ’ t do an awful thing like that ! What you are saying about Ishmael isn ’ t true. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	41	41	In the seventh month Ishmael came with ten men to Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam , at Mizpah . Ishmael was the son of Nethaniah . Nethaniah was the son of Elishama . Ishmael was a member of the royal family . He had been one of the king ’ s officers . Ishmael and his ten men were eating together at Mizpah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	2	They got up and struck down Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam , with their swords . They killed him even though the king of Babylon had appointed him as governor over Judah . Ahikam was the son of Shaphan .
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	3	Ishmael also killed all the men of Judah who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah . And he killed the Babylonian soldiers who were there .
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	4	On the next day , people still hadn ’ t found out that Gedaliah had been murdered .
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	5	On that day
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	80	men came from Shechem , Shiloh and Samaria . They had shaved off their beards . They had torn their clothes . And they had cut themselves . They brought grain offerings and incense with them . They took them to the Lord ’ s house .
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	6	Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , went out from Mizpah to meet them . He was weeping as he went . When he met them , he said , “ Come to Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	7	They went with him into the city . Then Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , and the men who were with him killed them . And they threw them into an empty well .
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	8	But ten of the men had spoken to Ishmael . They had said , “ Don ’ t kill us ! We have some wheat and barley . We also have olive oil and honey . We ’ ve hidden all of it in a field. ” So he didn ’ t kill them along with the others .
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	9	But he had thrown into the empty well all the bodies of the men he had killed . That included Gedaliah ’ s body . The well was the one King Asa had made . He had made it when he strengthened Mizpah against attack by Baasha , the king of Israel . Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , filled it with the bodies of those he had killed .
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	10	Nebuzaradan was the commander of the royal guard . He had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam over all the people at Mizpah . But Ishmael made prisoners of the people left at Mizpah . These prisoners included women who were members of the royal court . The prisoners also included everyone else left at Mizpah . Then Ishmael started out to go across the Jordan River to the land of Ammon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	11	Johanan , the son of Kareah , was told what had happened . And so were all the other army officers with him . They heard about all the crimes Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , had committed .
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	12	So they brought all their men together . Then they went to fight against Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah . They caught up with him near the large pool in Gibeon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	13	Ishmael had many people with him . They saw Johanan , the son of Kareah . And they saw the other army officers who were with him . So the people who had been forced to go with Ishmael were glad .
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	14	Ishmael had taken those people from Mizpah as prisoners . But now they turned and went over to the side of Johanan , the son of Kareah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	15	But Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , and eight of his men escaped from Johanan . They ran away to the land of Ammon . Some Jews Take Jeremiah to Egypt
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	16	Then Johanan , the son of Kareah , led away all the people of Mizpah who were still alive . All the other army officers with Johanan helped him do this . He had taken them away from Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah . That happened after Ishmael had murdered Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam . The people Johanan had taken away included soldiers , women , children and court officials . He had brought them from Gibeon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	17	They went on their way . They stopped at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem . They were going to Egypt .
NIRV	Jeremiah	41	18	They wanted to get away from the Babylonians . They were afraid of them . That ’ s because Ishmael , the son of Nethaniah , had killed Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam . The king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor over Judah . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	42	42	Then all the army officers approached Jeremiah . They included Johanan , the son of Kareah , and Jezaniah , the son of Hoshaiah . All the people from the least important of them to the most important also came .
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	2	All of them said to Jeremiah the prophet , “ Please listen to our appeal . Pray to the Lord your God . Pray for all of us who are left here . Once there were many of us . But as you can see , only a few of us are left now .
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	3	So pray to the Lord your God . Pray that he ’ ll tell us where we should go . Pray that he ’ ll tell us what we should do. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	4	“ I ’ ve heard you , ” Jeremiah the prophet replied . “ I ’ ll certainly pray to the Lord your God . I ’ ll do what you have asked me to do . In fact , I ’ ll tell you everything the Lord says . I won ’ t keep anything back from you. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	5	Then they said to Jeremiah , “ We ’ ll do everything the Lord your God sends you to tell us to do . If we don ’ t , may he be a true and faithful witness against us .
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	6	It doesn ’ t matter whether what you say is in our favor or not . We ’ re asking you to pray to the Lord our God . And we ’ ll obey him . Things will go well with us . That ’ s because we will obey the Lord our God. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	7	Ten days later a message came to Jeremiah from the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	8	So Jeremiah sent for Johanan , the son of Kareah , and all the other army officers with him . Jeremiah also gathered together all the people from the least important of them to the most important .
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	9	He said to all of them , “ The Lord is the God of Israel . You asked me to present your appeal to him . He told me ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	10	‘ Stay in this land . Then I will build you up . I will not tear you down . I will plant you . I will not pull you up by the roots . I have decided to stop bringing trouble on you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	11	Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon . You are afraid of him now . Do not be , ’ announces the Lord . ‘ I am with you . I will keep you safe . I will save you from his power .
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	12	I will show you my loving concern . Then he will have concern for you . And he will let you return to your land. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	13	“ But suppose you say , ‘ We won ’ t stay in this land. ’ If you do , you will be disobeying the Lord your God .
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	14	And suppose you say , ‘ No ! We ’ ll go and live in Egypt . There we won ’ t have to face war anymore . We won ’ t hear the trumpets of war . And we won ’ t get hungry. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	15	Then listen to what the Lord says to you who are left in Judah . He is the Lord who rules over all . He is the God of Israel . He says , ‘ Have you already made up your minds to go to Egypt ? Are you going to make your homes there ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	16	Then the war you fear will catch up with you there . The hunger you are afraid of will follow you into Egypt . And you will die there .
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	17	In fact , that will happen to all those who go and make there homes in Egypt . All of them will die of war , hunger and plague . Not one of them will live . None of them will escape the trouble I will bring on them. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	18	He is the Lord who rules over all . He is the God of Israel . He says , ‘ My great anger has been poured out on those who used to live in Jerusalem . In the same way , it will be poured out on you when you go to Egypt . People will use your name in a curse . They will be shocked at you . They will say bad things about you . And they will say you are shameful . You will never see this place again. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	19	“ The Lord has spoken to you who are left in Judah . He has said , ‘ Do not go to Egypt. ’ Here is something you can be sure of . I am warning you about it today .
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	20	You made a big mistake when you asked me to pray to the Lord your God . You said , ‘ Pray to the Lord our God for us . Tell us everything he says . We ’ ll do it. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	21	I have told you today what the Lord your God wants you to do . But you still haven ’ t obeyed him . You haven ’ t done anything he sent me to tell you to do .
NIRV	Jeremiah	42	22	So here is something else you can be sure of . You will die of war , hunger and plague . You want to go and make your homes in Egypt . But you will die there. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	43	43	Jeremiah finished telling the people everything the Lord their God had said . Jeremiah told them everything the Lord had sent him to tell them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	43	2	After that , Azariah , the son of Hoshaiah , and Johanan , the son of Kareah , spoke to Jeremiah . And all the proud men joined them . They said , “ You are lying ! The Lord our God hasn ’ t sent you to speak to us . He hasn ’ t told you to say , ‘ You must not go to Egypt and make your homes there. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	43	3	But Baruch , the son of Neriah , is turning you against us . He wants us to be handed over to the Babylonians . Then they can kill us . Or they can take us away to Babylon. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	43	4	So Johanan , the son of Kareah , disobeyed the Lord ’ s command . So did all the other army officers and all the people . They didn ’ t stay in the land of Judah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	43	5	Instead Johanan , the son of Kareah , and all the other army officers led away all the people who were left in Judah . Those people had returned to Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered .
NIRV	Jeremiah	43	6	Johanan and the other officers also led away many people Nebuzaradan had left at Mizpah . They included men , women and children . They also included the king ’ s daughters . Nebuzaradan had left them with Gedaliah , the son of Ahikam . They also took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah along with them . Nebuzaradan was commander of the royal guard . Ahikam was the son of Shaphan .
NIRV	Jeremiah	43	7	So the Jewish leaders disobeyed the Lord . They took everyone to Egypt . They went all the way to Tahpanhes .
NIRV	Jeremiah	43	8	In Tahpanhes a message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	43	9	“ Make sure the Jews are watching you . Then get some large stones . Go to the entrance to Pharaoh ’ s house in Tahpanhes . Bury the stones in the clay under the brick walkway there .
NIRV	Jeremiah	43	10	Then tell the Jews , ‘ The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , “ I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon . And I will set his throne over these stones that are buried here . He will set up his royal tent over them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	43	11	He will come and attack Egypt . He will bring death to those I have appointed to die . He will take away as prisoners those I have appointed to be taken away . And he will kill with swords those I have appointed to be killed .
NIRV	Jeremiah	43	12	He will set the temples of the gods of Egypt on fire . He will burn down their temples . He will take away the statues of their gods . Nebuchadnezzar will be like a shepherd who picks his coat clean of lice . Nebuchadnezzar will pick Egypt clean and then depart .
NIRV	Jeremiah	43	13	At Heliopolis in Egypt he will smash the sacred pillars to pieces . And he will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt. ” ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	44	44	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah . It was about all the Jews living in Lower Egypt . They were living in Migdol , Tahpanhes and Memphis . It was also about all the Jews living in Upper Egypt .
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	2	The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He said , “ You saw all the trouble I brought on Jerusalem . I also brought it on all the towns in Judah . Today they lie there deserted and destroyed .
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	3	That ’ s because of the evil things their people did . They made me very angry . They burned incense to other gods . And they worshiped them . They and you and your people of long ago never knew those gods .
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	4	Again and again I sent my servants the prophets . They said , ‘ Don ’ t worship other gods ! The Lord hates it ! ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	5	But the people didn ’ t listen . They didn ’ t pay any attention . They didn ’ t turn from their sinful ways . They didn ’ t stop burning incense to other gods .
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	6	So my burning anger was poured out . It blazed out against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem . It made them the dry and empty places they are today. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	7	The Lord God who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , “ Why do you want to bring all this trouble on yourselves ? You are removing from Judah its men and women , its children and babies . Not one of you will be left .
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	8	Why do you want to make me angry with the gods your hands have made ? Why do you burn incense to the gods of Egypt , where you now live ? You will destroy yourselves . All the nations on earth will use your name as a curse . They will say you are shameful .
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	9	Have you forgotten the evil things done by your people of long ago ? The kings and queens of Judah did those same things . So did you and your wives . They were done in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem .
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	10	To this day the people of Judah have not made themselves humble in my sight . They have not shown any respect for me . They have not obeyed my law . They have not followed the rules I gave you and your people of long ago. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	11	The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , “ I have decided to bring horrible trouble on you . I will destroy the whole land of Judah .
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	12	I will destroy the people of Judah who are left . They had decided to go to Egypt and make their homes there . But all of them will die in Egypt . They will die of war or hunger . All of them will die , from the least important of them to the most important . They will die of war or hunger . People will use their name as a curse . They will be shocked at them . They will say bad things about them . And they will say they are shameful .
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	13	I will use war , hunger and plague to punish the Jews who live in Egypt . I punished Jerusalem in the same way .
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	14	None of the people of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape . Not one of them will live to return to Judah . They long to return and live there . But only a few will escape from Egypt and go back. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	15	All the Jews who were living in Lower and Upper Egypt gathered to give Jeremiah their answer . A large crowd had come together . It included men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods . Their wives were there with them . All of them said to Jeremiah ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	16	“ We won ’ t listen to the message you have spoken to us in the Lord ’ s name !
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	17	We will certainly do everything we said we would . We ’ ll burn incense to the female god called the Queen of Heaven . We ’ ll pour out drink offerings to her . We ’ ll do just as we and our people of long ago have done . Our kings and our officials also did it . All of us did it in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem . At that time we had plenty of food . We were well off . We didn ’ t suffer any harm .
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	18	But then we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven . We stopped pouring out drink offerings to her . And ever since that time we haven ’ t had anything . Instead , we ’ ve been dying of war and hunger. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	19	The women added , “ We burned incense to the Queen of Heaven . We poured out drink offerings to her . And our husbands knew we were making cakes that looked like her . They knew we were pouring out drink offerings to her. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	20	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people who were answering him . He spoke to men and women alike . He said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	21	“ Didn ’ t the Lord know you were burning incense in the towns of Judah ? Didn ’ t he care that you were also doing it in the streets of Jerusalem ? You and your people of long ago were doing it . Your kings and officials were doing it too . So were the rest of the people in the land .
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	22	The Lord couldn ’ t put up any longer with the evil things you were doing . He hated the things you did . So your land became a curse . It became a dry and empty desert . No one lived there . And that ’ s the way it still is today .
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	23	You have burned incense to other gods . You have sinned against the Lord . You haven ’ t obeyed him or his law . You haven ’ t followed his rules . You haven ’ t lived up to the terms of the covenant he made with you . That ’ s why all this trouble has come on you . You have seen it with your own eyes. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	24	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people . That included the women . He said , “ All you people of Judah in Egypt , listen to the Lord ’ s message .
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	25	The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , ‘ You and your wives have done what you promised you would do . You said , “ We will certainly keep the promises we made to the Queen of Heaven . We ’ ll burn incense to her . We ’ ll pour out drink offerings to her. ” ’ “ Go ahead then . Do what you said you would ! Keep your promises !
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	26	But listen to the Lord ’ s message . Listen , all you Jews living in Egypt . ‘ I make a promise by my own great name , ’ says the Lord . ‘ Here is what I promise . “ No one from Judah who lives anywhere in Egypt will ever again pray in my name . None of them will ever make this promise . They will never say , ‘ You can be sure that the Lord and King is alive. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	27	I am watching over them to do them harm and not good . The Jews in Egypt will die of war and hunger until all of them are destroyed .
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	28	Some will not be killed . They will return to Judah from Egypt . But they will be very few . Then all the people of Judah who came to live in Egypt will know the truth . They will know whether what I say or what they say will come true .
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	29	“ ‘ I will give you a sign that I will punish you in this place , ’ announces the Lord . ‘ Then you can be sure that my warnings of harm against you will come true. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	44	30	The Lord says , ‘ I am going to hand over Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt . I will hand him over to his enemies who want to kill him . In the same way , I handed over King Zedekiah to Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon . He was the enemy who wanted to kill Zedekiah. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Jeremiah	46	46	A message from the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet . It was about the nations .
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	2	Here is what the Lord says about Egypt . Here is his message against the army of Pharaoh Necho . He was king of Egypt . Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon , won the battle over Necho ’ s army . That happened at Carchemish on the Euphrates River . It was in the fourth year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah . He was the son of Josiah . The message says ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	3	“ Egyptians , prepare your shields ! Prepare large and small shields alike ! March out for battle !
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	4	Get the horses and chariots ready to ride ! Take up your battle positions ! Put on your helmets ! Shine up your spears ! Put on your armor !
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	5	What do I see ? The Egyptians are terrified . They are pulling back . Their soldiers are losing . They run away as fast as they can . They do not look back . There is terror on every side , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	6	“ Those who run fast can ’ t get away . Those who are strong can ’ t escape . In the north by the Euphrates River they trip and fall .
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	7	“ Who is this that rises like the Nile River ? Who rises like rivers of rushing waters ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	8	Egypt rises like the Nile River . It rises like rivers of rushing waters . Egypt says , ‘ I will rise and cover the earth . I ’ ll destroy cities and their people. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	9	Charge , you horses ! Drive fast , you chariot drivers ! March on , you soldiers ! March on , you men of Cush and Put who carry shields . March on , you men of Lydia who shoot arrows .
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	10	But that day belongs to me . I am the Lord who rules over all . It is a day for me to pay back my enemies . My sword will eat until it is satisfied . It will drink until it is not thirsty for blood anymore . I am the Lord . I am the Lord who rules over all . I will offer a sacrifice . I will offer it in the land of the north by the Euphrates River .
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	11	“ People of Egypt , go up to Gilead and get some healing lotion . You may try many medicines , but you will not be healed . There isn ’ t any healing for you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	12	The nations will hear about your shame . Your cries of pain will fill the earth . One soldier will trip over another . Both of them will fall down together. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	13	Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon , was coming to attack Egypt . Here is the message the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about it . He said ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	14	“ Egyptians , here is what I want you to announce in your land . Announce it in the city of Migdol . Also announce it in Memphis and Tahpanhes . Say , ‘ Take up your battle positions ! Get ready ! The sword eats up those around you. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	15	Why are your soldiers lying on the ground ? They can ’ t stand , because I bring them down .
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	16	They will trip again and again . They will fall over one another . They will say , ‘ Get up . Let ’ s go back home . Let ’ s return to our own people and our own lands . Let ’ s get away from the swords that will bring us great harm. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	17	The Egyptian soldiers will cry out , ‘ Pharaoh , our king , is only a loud noise . He has missed his chance to win the battle. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	18	“ I am the King . My name is the Lord Who Rules Over All . Someone will come who is like Mount Tabor among the mountains . He is like Mount Carmel by the Mediterranean Sea . And that is just as sure as I am alive , ” announces the King .
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	19	“ So pack your belongings , you who live in Egypt . You will be taken away from your land . Memphis will be completely destroyed . Its buildings will be broken down . No one will live there .
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	20	“ Egypt is like a beautiful young cow . But Nebuchadnezzar is coming against her from the north . He will bite her like a fly .
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	21	Hired soldiers are in Egypt ’ s army . They are like fat calves . All of them will turn and run away . They will not hold their positions . The day of trouble is coming on them . The time for them to be punished is near .
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	22	The Egyptians will hiss like a snake that is trying to get away . A powerful army will advance against them . Their enemies will come against them with axes . They will be like those who cut down trees .
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	23	Egypt is like a thick forest . But they will chop it down , ” announces the Lord . “ There are more of their enemies than there are locusts . In fact , they can ’ t even be counted .
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	24	The nation of Egypt will be put to shame . It will be handed over to the people of the north. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	25	The Lord who rules over all is the God of Israel . He says , “ I am about to punish Amon , the god of Thebes . I will also punish Pharaoh . I will punish Egypt and its gods and kings . And I will punish those who depend on Pharaoh .
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	26	I will hand them over to those who want to kill them . I will give them to Nebuchadnezzar , the king of Babylon , and his officers . But later , many people will live in Egypt again as in times past , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	27	“ People of Jacob , do not be afraid . You are my servant . Israel , do not be terrified . I will bring you safely out of a place far away . I will bring your children back from the land where they were taken . Your people will have peace and security again . And no one will make them afraid .
NIRV	Jeremiah	46	28	People of Jacob , do not be afraid . You are my servant . I am with you , ” announces the Lord . “ I will completely destroy all the nations among which I scatter you .

They will flow over the towns and those who live in them . The people will cry out . All those who live in the land will weep .
NIRV	Jeremiah	47	3	They will weep when they hear galloping horses . They will weep at the noise of enemy chariots . They will weep at the rumble of their wheels . Parents will not even try to help their children . Their hands will not be able to help them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	47	4	The day has come to destroy all the Philistines . The time has come to remove all those who could help Tyre and Sidon . I am about to destroy the Philistines . I will not leave anyone alive who came from the coasts of Crete .
NIRV	Jeremiah	47	5	The people of Gaza will be so sad they will shave their heads . And Ashkelon ’ s people will be silent . You who remain on the plain , how long will you cut yourselves ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	47	6	“ ‘ Sword of the Lord ! ’ you cry out . ‘ How long will it be until you rest ? Return to the place you came from . Stop killing us ! Be still ! ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	47	7	But how can his sword rest when the Lord has given it a command ? He has ordered it to attack Ashkelon and the Philistine coast. ” Copyright ©

Kiriathaim will be captured . It will be put to shame . Its fort will be broken down . It will be put to shame .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	2	Moab will not be praised anymore . In Heshbon people will plan its fall from power . They will say , ‘ Come . Let ’ s put an end to that nation. ’ City of Madmen , you too will be silent . My sword will hunt you down .

NIRV	Jeremiah	48	4	Moab will be broken . Her little ones will cry out .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	5	The people go up the hill to Luhith . They are weeping bitterly as they go . Loud cries are heard on the road down to Horonaim . People cry out because the town is being destroyed .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	6	People of Moab , run away ! Run for your lives ! Become like a lonely bush in the desert .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	7	You trust in the things you can do . You trust in your riches . So you too will be taken away as prisoners . Your god named Chemosh will be carried away . So will its priests and officials .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	8	The one who is going to destroy you will come against every town . Not even one of them will escape . The valley and the high plain will be destroyed . The Lord has spoken .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	9	Sprinkle salt all over Moab . It will be completely destroyed . Its towns will be a dry and empty desert . No one will live in them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	10	“ May anyone who is lazy when they do the Lord ’ s work be under my curse ! May anyone who keeps their sword from killing be under my curse !
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	11	“ Moab has been at peace and rest from its earliest days . It is like wine that has not been shaken up . It has not been poured from one jar to another . Moab ’ s people have not been taken away from their land . They are like wine that tastes as it always did . Its smell has not changed at all .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	12	But other days are coming , ” announces the Lord . “ At that time I will send people who pour wine from pitchers . They will pour Moab out like wine . They will empty its pitchers . They will smash its jars .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	13	Then Moab ’ s people will be ashamed of their god named Chemosh . They will be ashamed just as the people of Israel were when they trusted in their false god at Bethel .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	14	“ How can you say , ‘ We are soldiers . We are men who are brave in battle ’ ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	15	Moab will be destroyed . Its enemies will march into its towns . Its finest young men will die in battle , ” announces the King . His name is the Lord Who Rules Over All .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	16	“ The fall of Moab is near . Its time of trouble will come quickly .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	17	All you who live around it , mourn for its people . Be sad , you who know how famous Moab is . Say , ‘ Its powerful ruler ’ s scepter is broken ! His glorious scepter is smashed. ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	18	“ Come down from your glorious city , you who live in Dibon . Come and sit on the thirsty ground . The one who destroys Moab will come up and attack you . Your enemies will destroy your cities that have high walls around them .

NIRV	Jeremiah	48	20	Moab has been put to shame . It has been destroyed . Weep and cry out ! Tell everyone Moab has been destroyed . Announce it by the Arnon River .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	21	The high plain has been judged . So have Holon , Jahzah and Mephaath .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	22	Dibon , Nebo and Beth Diblathaim have been judged .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	23	So have Kiriathaim , Beth Gamul and Beth Meon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	24	Kerioth and Bozrah have also been judged . And so have all the towns of Moab , far and near alike .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	25	Moab ’ s power is gone . Its strength is broken , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	26	“ Moab ’ s people think they are better than I am . So let their enemies make them drunk . Let the people get sick and throw up . Let them roll around in the mess they have made . Let people laugh at them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	27	Moab , you laughed at Israel , didn ’ t you ? Were Israel ’ s people caught among robbers ? Is that why you shake your head at them ? Is that why you make fun of them every time you talk about them ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	28	Leave your towns , you who live in Moab . Go and live among the rocks . Be like a dove that makes its nest at the entrance of a cave .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	29	“ We have heard all about Moab ’ s pride . We have heard how very proud they are . They think they are so much better than others . Their pride reaches deep down inside their hearts .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	30	I know how rude they are . But it will not get them anywhere , ” announces the Lord . “ Their bragging does not accomplish anything .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	31	So I weep over Moab . I cry for all Moab ’ s people . I groan for the people of Kir Hareseth .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	32	I weep for you as Jazer weeps , you vines of Sibmah . Your branches used to spread out . They went all the way down to the Dead Sea . They reached as far as the sea of Jazer . The one who destroys your country has taken away your grapes and ripe fruit .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	33	Joy has left your orchards . Gladness is gone from your fields . I have stopped the flow of juice from your winepresses . No one stomps on your grapes with shouts of joy . There are shouts . But they are not shouts of joy .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	34	“ The sound of their cry rises from Heshbon . It rises as far as Elealeh and Jahaz . It rises from Zoar . It goes all the way to Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah . Even the waters at Nimrim are dried up .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	35	In Moab people sacrifice offerings on the high places . They burn incense to their gods . But I will put an end to those people , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	36	“ Like a flute my heart sings a song of sadness for Moab . It sings like a flute for the people of Kir Hareseth . The wealth they had acquired is gone .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	37	Every head is shaved . Every beard is cut off . Every hand is cut . And every waist is covered with the clothes of sadness .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	38	Weeping is the only sound in Moab . It is heard on all its roofs . It is heard in the market . I have broken Moab like a jar that no one wants , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	39	“ How broken Moab is ! How the people weep ! They turn away from others because they are so ashamed . All those around them laugh at them . They are shocked at them. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	40	The Lord says , “ Look ! Nebuchadnezzar is like an eagle diving down . He is spreading his wings over Moab .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	41	Kerioth will be captured . Its forts will be taken . At that time the hearts of Moab ’ s soldiers will tremble in fear . They will be like the heart of a woman having a baby .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	42	Moab will be destroyed as a nation . That is because its people thought they were better than the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	43	You people of Moab , ” announces the Lord , “ terror , a pit and a trap are waiting for you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	44	Anyone who runs away from the terror will fall into the pit . Anyone who climbs out of the pit will be caught in the trap . The time is coming when I will punish Moab , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	45	“ In the shadow of Heshbon those who are trying to escape stand helpless . A fire has blazed out from Heshbon . Flames have come out from Sihon ’ s city . It burns the foreheads of Moab ’ s people . It burns the skulls of those who brag loudly .
NIRV	Jeremiah	48	46	How terrible it will be for you , Moab ! Those who worship Chemosh are destroyed . Your sons are being taken to another country . Your daughters are taken away as prisoners .

NIRV	Jeremiah	49	49	Here is what the Lord says about the people of Ammon . He says , “ Doesn ’ t Israel have any sons ? Doesn ’ t Israel have anyone to take over the family property ? Then why has the god named Molek taken over Gad ? Why do those who worship him live in its towns ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	2	But a new day is coming , ” announces the Lord . “ At that time I will sound the battle cry . I will sound it against Rabbah in the land of Ammon . It will become a pile of broken-down buildings . The villages around it will be set on fire . Then Israel will drive out those who drove her out , ” says the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	3	“ Heshbon , weep for Ai ! It is destroyed ! Cry out , you who live in Rabbah ! Put on the clothes of sadness and mourn . Run here and there inside the walls . Your god named Molek will be carried away . So will its priests and officials .
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	4	Why do you brag about your valleys ? You brag that they produce so many crops . Ammon , you are an unfaithful country . You trust in your riches . You say , ‘ Who will attack me ? ’
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	5	I will bring terror on you . It will come from all those around you , ” announces the Lord . He is the Lord who rules over all . “ Every one of you will be driven away . No one will bring back those who escape .
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	6	“ But after that , I will bless the people of Ammon with great success again , ” announces the Lord . A Message About Edom
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	7	Here is what the Lord says about Edom . The Lord who rules over all says , “ Isn ’ t there wisdom in the town of Teman anymore ? Can ’ t those who are wise give advice ? Has their wisdom disappeared completely ?
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	8	Turn around and run away , you who live in Dedan . Hide in deep caves . I will bring trouble on Esau ’ s family line . I will do this at the time I punish them .
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	9	Edom , suppose grape pickers came to harvest your vines . They would still leave a few grapes . Suppose robbers came at night . They would steal only as much as they wanted .
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	10	But I will strip everything away from Esau ’ s people . I will uncover their hiding places . They will not be able to hide anywhere . Their army is destroyed . Their friends and neighbors are destroyed . So there is no one to say ,
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	11	‘ Leave your children whose fathers have died . I will keep them alive . Your widows can also depend on me. ’ ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	12	The Lord says , “ What if those who do not have to drink the cup must drink it anyway ? Then shouldn ’ t you be punished ? You will certainly be punished . You must drink the cup .
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	13	I make a promise in my own name . Bozrah will be destroyed , ” announces the Lord . “ People will be shocked at it . They will say Bozrah is a shameful place . They will use its name as a curse . And all its towns will be destroyed forever. ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	14	I ’ ve heard a message from the Lord . A messenger was sent to the nations . The Lord told him to say , “ Gather yourselves together to attack Edom ! Prepare for battle ! ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	15	The Lord says to Edom , “ I will make you weak among the nations . They will hate you .
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	16	You live in the safety of the rocks . You live on top of the hills . But the terror you stir up has now turned against you . Your proud heart has tricked you . You build your nest as high as an eagle does . But I will bring you down from there , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	17	“ People of Edom , all those who pass by you will be shocked . They will make fun of you because of all your wounds .
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	18	Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed . So were the towns that were near them , ” says the Lord . “ You will be just like them . No one will live in your land . No human beings will stay there .
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	19	“ I will be like a lion coming up from the bushes by the Jordan River . I will hunt in rich grasslands . I will chase you from your land in an instant . What nation will I choose to do this ? Which one will I appoint ? Is anyone like me ? Who would dare to argue with me ? What leader can stand against me ? ”
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	20	So listen to what the Lord has planned against the people of Edom . Hear what he has planned against those who live in Teman . Edom ’ s young people will be dragged away . Their grasslands will be shocked at their fate .
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	21	When the earth hears Edom fall , it will shake . The people ’ s cries will be heard all the way to the Red Sea .
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	22	Look ! An enemy is coming . It ’ s like an eagle diving down . It will spread its wings over Bozrah . At that time the hearts of Edom ’ s soldiers will tremble in fear . They ’ ll be like the heart of a woman having a baby . A Message About Damascus
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	23	Here is what the Lord says about Damascus . He says , “ The people of Hamath and Arpad are terrified . They have heard bad news . They have lost all hope . They are troubled like the rolling sea .
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	24	The people of Damascus have become weak . They have turned to run away . Panic has taken hold of them . Suffering and pain have taken hold of them . Their pain is like the pain of a woman having a baby .
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	25	Why hasn ’ t the famous city been deserted ? It is the town I take delight in .
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	26	You can be sure its young men will fall dead in the streets . All its soldiers will be put to death at that time , ” announces the Lord who rules over all .
NIRV	Jeremiah	49	27	“ I will set the walls of Damascus on fire . It will burn down the strong towers of King Ben-Hadad. ” A Message About Kedar and Hazor

NIRV	Jeremiah	50	6	“ My people have been like lost sheep . Their shepherds have led them astray . They have caused them to wander in the mountains . They have wandered over mountains and hills . They have forgotten that I am their true resting place .
NIRV	Jeremiah	50	7	Everyone who found them destroyed them . Their enemies said , ‘ We aren ’ t guilty . They sinned against the Lord . He gave them everything they needed . He has always been Israel ’ s hope. ’

Jeremiah told Seraiah to take the message with him to Babylon . Seraiah went there with Zedekiah , the king of Judah . He left in the fourth year of Zedekiah ’ s rule .
NIRV	Jeremiah	51	60	Jeremiah had written about all the trouble that would come on Babylon . He had written it down on a scroll . It included everything that had been recorded about Babylon .
NIRV	Jeremiah	51	61	Jeremiah said to Seraiah , “ When you get to Babylon , here ’ s what I want you to do . Make sure that you read all these words out loud .

NIRV	Jeremiah	52	31	Awel-Marduk set Jehoiachin , the king of Judah , free from prison . It was in the 37th year after Jehoiachin had been taken away to Babylon . It was also the year Awel-Marduk became king of Babylon . It was on the 25th day of the 12th month .
NIRV	Jeremiah	52	32	Awel-Marduk spoke kindly to Jehoiachin . He gave him a place of honor . Other kings were with Jehoiachin in Babylon . But his place was more important than theirs .
NIRV	Jeremiah	52	33	So Jehoiachin put away his prison clothes . For the rest of Jehoiachin ’ s life the king of Babylon provided what he needed .
NIRV	Jeremiah	52	34	The king did that for Jehoiachin day by day as long as he lived . He did it until the day Jehoiachin died . Copyright ©

NIRV	Lamentations	1	1	The city of Jerusalem is so empty ! She used to be full of people . But now she ’ s like a woman whose husband has died . She used to be great among the nations . She was like a queen among the kingdoms . But now she is a slave .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	2	Jerusalem weeps bitterly at night . Tears run down her cheeks . None of her friends comforts her . All those who were going to help her have turned against her . They have become her enemies .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	3	After Judah ’ s people had suffered greatly , they were taken away as prisoners . Now they live among the nations . They can ’ t find any place to rest . All those who were chasing them have caught up with them . And they can ’ t get away .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	4	The roads to Zion are empty . No one travels to her appointed feasts . All the public places near her gates are deserted . Her priests groan . Her young women are sad . And Zion herself weeps bitterly .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	5	Her enemies have become her masters . They have an easy life . The Lord has brought suffering to Jerusalem because her people have committed so many sins . Her children have been taken away as prisoners . Her enemies have forced her people to leave their homes .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	6	The city of Zion used to be full of glory . But now her glory has faded away . Her princes are like deer . They can ’ t find anything to eat . They are almost too weak to get away from those who hunt them down .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	7	Jerusalem ’ s people are suffering and wandering . They remember all the treasures they used to have . But they fell into the hands of their enemies . And no one was there to help them . Their enemies looked at them . They laughed because Jerusalem had been destroyed .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	8	Her people have committed many sins . They have become impure . All those who honored Jerusalem now look down on her . They all look at her as if she were a naked woman . The city groans and turns away in shame .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	9	Her skirts are dirty . She didn ’ t think about how things might turn out . Her fall from power amazed everyone . And no one was there to comfort her . She said , “ Lord , please pay attention to how much I ’ m suffering . My enemies have won the battle over me. ”
NIRV	Lamentations	1	10	Jerusalem ’ s enemies took away all her treasures . Her people saw outsiders enter her temple . The Lord had commanded them not to do that .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	11	All Jerusalem ’ s people groan as they search for bread . They trade their treasures for food just to stay alive . Jerusalem says , “ Lord , look at me . Think about my condition . Everyone looks down on me. ”
NIRV	Lamentations	1	12	Jerusalem also says , “ All you who are passing by , don ’ t you care about what has happened to me ? Just look at my condition . Has anyone suffered the way I have ? The Lord has brought all this on me . He has made me suffer . His anger has burned against me .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	13	“ He sent down fire from heaven . It went deep down into my bones . He spread a net to catch me by the feet . He stopped me right where I was . He made me empty . I am sick all the time .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	14	“ My sins have been made into a heavy yoke . They were woven together by his hands . They have been placed on my neck . The Lord has taken away my strength . He has handed me over to my enemies . I can ’ t win the battle over them .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	15	“ The Lord has refused to accept any of my soldiers . He has sent for an army to crush my young men . I am like grapes in the Lord ’ s winepress . He has stomped on me , even though I am his very own .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	16	“ That ’ s why I am weeping . Tears are flowing from my eyes . No one is near to comfort me . No one can heal my spirit . My children don ’ t have anything . My enemies are much too strong for me. ”
NIRV	Lamentations	1	17	Zion reaches out her hands . But no one is there to comfort her people . The Lord has ordered that the neighbors of Jacob ’ s people would become their enemies . Jerusalem has become impure among them .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	18	Jerusalem says , “ The Lord always does what is right . But I refused to obey his commands . Listen , all you nations . Pay attention to how much I ’ m suffering . My young men and women have been taken away as prisoners .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	19	“ I called out to those who were going to help me . But they turned against me . My priests and elders died in the city . They were searching for food just to stay alive .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	20	“ Lord , see how upset I am ! I am suffering deep down inside . My heart is troubled . Again and again I have refused to obey you . Outside the city , people are being killed by swords . Inside , there is nothing but death .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	21	“ People have heard me groan . But no one is here to comfort me . My enemies have heard about all my troubles . What you have done makes them happy . So please judge them , just as you said you would . Let them become like me .
NIRV	Lamentations	1	22	“ Please pay attention to all their sinful ways . Punish them as you have punished me . You judged me because I had committed so many sins . I groan all the time . And my heart is weak. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Lamentations	2	2	Without pity the Lord swallowed up all the homes of Jacob ’ s people . When he was angry , he tore down the forts of the people of Judah . He brought down their kingdom and princes to the ground in dishonor .
NIRV	Lamentations	2	3	When he was very angry , he took away Israel ’ s power . He pulled back his powerful right hand as the enemy approached . His burning anger blazed out in Jacob ’ s land . It burned up everything near it .
NIRV	Lamentations	2	4	Like an enemy the Lord got his bow ready to use . He had a sword in his right hand . Like an enemy he destroyed everything that used to be pleasing to him . His anger blazed out like fire . It burned up the homes in the city of Zion .
NIRV	Lamentations	2	5	The Lord was like an enemy . He swallowed up Israel . He swallowed up all of its palaces . He destroyed its forts . He filled the people of Judah with sorrow and sadness .
NIRV	Lamentations	2	6	The Lord ’ s temple was like a garden . But he completely destroyed it . He destroyed the place where he used to meet with his people . He made Zion ’ s people forget their appointed feasts and Sabbath days . When he was very angry , he turned his back on king and priest alike .
NIRV	Lamentations	2	7	The Lord deserted his altar . He left his temple . He gave the walls of Jerusalem ’ s palaces into the hands of her enemies . They shouted loudly in the house of the Lord . You would have thought it was the day of an appointed feast .
NIRV	Lamentations	2	8	The Lord decided to tear down the walls around the city of Zion . He measured out what he wanted to destroy . Then he destroyed Jerusalem by his power . He made even her towers and walls sing songs of sadness . All of them fell down .
NIRV	Lamentations	2	9	Her gates sank down into the ground . He broke the metal bars that locked her gates , and he destroyed them . Her king and princes were taken away to other nations . There is no law anymore . Jerusalem ’ s prophets no longer receive visions from the Lord .
NIRV	Lamentations	2	10	The elders of the city of Zion sit silently on the ground . They have sprinkled dust on their heads . They ’ ve put on the clothes of sadness . The young women of Jerusalem have bowed their heads toward the ground .
NIRV	Lamentations	2	11	I ’ ve cried so much I can ’ t see very well . I ’ m suffering deep down inside . My heart is broken because my people are destroyed . Children and babies are fainting in the streets of the city .
NIRV	Lamentations	2	12	They say to their mothers , “ Where can we find something to eat and drink ? ” They faint like wounded soldiers in the streets of the city . Their lives are slipping away in their mothers ’ arms .
NIRV	Lamentations	2	13	City of Jerusalem , what can I say about you ? What can I compare you to ? People of Zion , what are you like ? I want to comfort you . Your wound is as deep as the ocean . Who can heal you ?
NIRV	Lamentations	2	14	The visions of your prophets were lies . They weren ’ t worth anything . They didn ’ t show you the sins you had committed . So that ’ s why you were captured . The messages they gave you were lies . They led you astray .
NIRV	Lamentations	2	15	All those who pass by clap their hands and make fun of you . They laugh at you and shake their heads at the city of Jerusalem . They say , “ Could that be the city that was called perfect and beautiful ? Is that the city that brought joy to everyone on earth ? ”
NIRV	Lamentations	2	16	All your enemies open their mouths wide against you . They laugh at you and grind their teeth . They say , “ We have swallowed up Jerusalem ’ s people . This is the day we ’ ve waited for . And we ’ ve lived to see it. ”
NIRV	Lamentations	2	17	The Lord has done what he planned to do . He has made what he said come true . He gave the command long ago . He has destroyed you without pity . He has let your enemies laugh at you . He has made them stronger than you are .
NIRV	Lamentations	2	18	People in the city of Zion , cry out from your heart to the Lord . Let your tears flow like a river day and night . Don ’ t stop at all . Don ’ t give your eyes any rest .
NIRV	Lamentations	2	19	Get up . Cry out as the night begins . Tell the Lord all your troubles . Lift up your hands to him . Pray that the lives of your children will be spared . At every street corner they faint because they are so hungry .
NIRV	Lamentations	2	20	Jerusalem says , “ Lord , look at me . Think about my condition . Have you ever treated anyone else like this ? Should women have to eat their babies ? Should they eat the children they ’ ve taken care of ? Should priests and prophets be killed in your own temple ?
NIRV	Lamentations	2	21	“ Young people and old people alike lie dead in the dust of my streets . My young men and women have been killed by swords . You killed them when you were angry . You put them to death without pity .
NIRV	Lamentations	2	22	“ You sent for terrors to come against me on every side . It was as if you were inviting people to enjoy a feast day . Because you were angry , no one escaped . No one was left alive . I took good care of my children and brought them up . But my enemies have destroyed them. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Lamentations	3	3	He has turned his powerful hand against me . He has done it again and again , all day long .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	2	He has driven me away . He has made me walk in darkness instead of light .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	4	He has worn out my body . He has broken my bones .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	5	He has surrounded me and attacked me . He has made me suffer bitterly . He has made things hard for me .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	6	He has made me live in darkness like those who are dead and gone .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	7	He has built walls around me , so I can ’ t escape . He has put heavy chains on me .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	8	I call out and cry for help . But he won ’ t listen to me when I pray .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	9	He has put up a stone wall to block my way . He has made my paths crooked .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	10	He has been like a bear waiting to attack me . He has been like a lion hiding in the bushes .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	11	He has dragged me off the path . He has torn me to pieces . And he has left me helpless .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	12	He has gotten his bow ready to use . He has shot his arrows at me .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	13	The arrows from his bag have gone through my heart .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	14	My people laugh at me all the time . They sing and make fun of me all day long .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	15	The Lord has made my life bitter . He has made me suffer bitterly .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	16	He made me chew stones that broke my teeth . He has walked all over me in the dust .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	17	I have lost all hope of ever having any peace . I ’ ve forgotten what good times are like .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	18	So I say , “ My glory has faded away . My hope in the Lord is gone. ”
NIRV	Lamentations	3	19	I remember how I suffered and wandered . I remember how bitter my life was .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	20	I remember it very well . My spirit is very sad deep down inside me .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	21	But here is something else I remember . And it gives me hope .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	22	The Lord loves us very much . So we haven ’ t been completely destroyed . His loving concern never fails .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	23	His great love is new every morning . Lord , how faithful you are !
NIRV	Lamentations	3	24	I say to myself , “ The Lord is everything I will ever need . So I will put my hope in him. ”
NIRV	Lamentations	3	25	The Lord is good to those who put their hope in him . He is good to those who look to him .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	26	It is good when people wait quietly for the Lord to save them .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	27	It is good for a man to carry a heavy load of suffering while he is young .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	28	Let him sit alone and not say anything . The Lord has placed that load on him .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	29	Let him bury his face in the dust . There might still be hope for him .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	30	Let him turn his cheek toward those who would slap him . Let him be filled with shame .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	31	The Lord doesn ’ t turn his back on people forever .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	32	He might bring suffering . But he will also show loving concern . How great his faithful love is !
NIRV	Lamentations	3	33	He doesn ’ t want to bring pain or suffering to anyone .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	34	Every time people crush prisoners under their feet , the Lord knows all about it .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	35	When people refuse to give someone what they should , the Most High God knows it .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	36	When people don ’ t treat someone fairly , the Lord knows it .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	37	Suppose people order something to happen . It won ’ t happen unless the Lord has planned it .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	38	Troubles and good things alike come to people because the Most High God has commanded them to come .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	39	A person who is still alive shouldn ’ t blame God when God punishes them for their sins .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	40	Let ’ s take a good look at the way we ’ re living . Let ’ s return to the Lord .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	41	Let ’ s lift up our hands to God in heaven . Let ’ s pray to him with all our hearts .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	42	Let ’ s say , “ We have sinned . We ’ ve refused to obey you . And you haven ’ t forgiven us .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	43	“ You have covered yourself with the cloud of your anger . You have chased us . You have killed us without pity .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	44	You have covered yourself with the cloud of your anger . Our prayers can ’ t get through to you .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	45	You have made us become like trash and garbage among the nations .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	46	“ All our enemies have opened their mouths wide to swallow us up .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	47	We are terrified and trapped . We are broken and destroyed. ”
NIRV	Lamentations	3	48	Streams of tears flow from my eyes . That ’ s because my people are destroyed .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	49	Tears will never stop flowing from my eyes . My eyes can ’ t get any rest .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	50	I ’ ll weep until the Lord looks down from heaven . I ’ ll cry until he notices my tears .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	51	What I see brings pain to my spirit . All the women of my city are mourning .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	52	Those who were my enemies for no reason at all hunted me down as if I were a bird .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	53	They tried to end my life by throwing me into a deep pit . They threw stones down at me .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	54	The water rose and covered my head . I thought I was going to die .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	55	Lord , I called out to you . I called out from the bottom of the pit .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	56	I prayed , “ Please don ’ t close your ears to my cry for help. ” And you heard my appeal .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	57	You came near when I called out to you . You said , “ Do not be afraid. ”
NIRV	Lamentations	3	58	Lord , you stood up for me in court . You saved my life and set me free .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	59	Lord , you have seen the wrong things people have done to me . Stand up for me again !
NIRV	Lamentations	3	60	You have seen how my enemies have tried to get even with me . You know all about their plans against me .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	61	Lord , you have heard them laugh at me . You know all about their plans against me .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	62	You have heard my enemies whispering among themselves . They speak against me all day long .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	63	Just look at them sitting and standing there ! They sing and make fun of me .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	64	Lord , pay them back . Punish them for what their hands have done .
NIRV	Lamentations	3	65	Cover their minds with a veil . Put a curse on them !
NIRV	Lamentations	3	66	Lord , get angry with them and hunt them down . Wipe them off the face of the earth . Copyright ©

NIRV	Lamentations	4	4	When the babies get thirsty , their tongues stick to the roofs of their mouths . When the children beg for bread , no one gives them any .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	2	The priceless children of Zion were worth their weight in gold . But now they are thought of as clay pots made by the hands of a potter .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	3	Even wild dogs nurse their young pups . But my people are as mean as ostriches in the desert .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	5	Those who once ate fine food are dying in the streets . Those who wore royal clothes are now lying on piles of trash .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	6	My people have been punished more than Sodom was . It was destroyed in a moment . No one offered it a helping hand .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	7	Jerusalem ’ s princes were brighter than snow . They were whiter than milk . Their bodies were redder than rubies . They looked like lapis lazuli .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	8	But now they are blacker than coal . No one even recognizes them in the streets . Their skin is wrinkled on their bones . It has become as dry as a stick .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	9	Those killed by swords are better off than those who die of hunger . Those who are hungry waste away to nothing . They don ’ t have any food from the fields .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	10	With their own hands , loving mothers have had to cook even their own children . They ate their children when my people were destroyed .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	11	The Lord has become very angry . He has poured out his burning anger . He started a fire in Zion . It burned its foundations .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	12	The kings of the earth couldn ’ t believe what was happening . Neither could any of the peoples of the world . Enemies actually attacked and entered the gates of Jerusalem .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	13	It happened because Jerusalem ’ s prophets had sinned . Her priests had done evil things . All of them spilled the blood of those who did what was right .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	14	Now those prophets and priests have to feel their way along the streets as if they were blind . The blood of those they killed has made them “ unclean. ” So no one dares to touch their clothes .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	15	“ Go away ! You are ‘ unclean ’ ! ” people cry out to them . “ Go away ! Get out of here ! Don ’ t touch us ! ” So they run away and wander around . Then people among the nations say , “ They can ’ t stay here anymore. ”
NIRV	Lamentations	4	16	The Lord himself has scattered them . He doesn ’ t watch over them anymore . No one shows the priests any respect . No one honors the elders .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	17	And that ’ s not all . Our eyes grew tired . We looked for help that never came . We watched from our towers . We kept looking for a nation that couldn ’ t save us .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	18	People hunted us down no matter where we went . We couldn ’ t even walk in our streets . Our end was near , so we only had a few days to live . Our end had come .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	19	Those who were hunting us down were faster than eagles in the sky . They chased us over the mountains . They hid and waited for us in the desert .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	20	Zedekiah , the Lord ’ s anointed king , was our last hope . But he was caught in their traps . We thought he would keep us safe . We expected to continue living among the nations .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	21	People of Edom , be joyful . You who live in the land of Uz , be glad . But the cup of the Lord ’ s anger will also be passed to you . Then you will become drunk . Your clothes will be stripped off .
NIRV	Lamentations	4	22	People of Zion , the time for you to be punished will come to an end . The Lord won ’ t keep you away from your land any longer . But he will punish your sin , people of Edom . He will show everyone the evil things you have done . Copyright ©

NIRV	Lamentations	5	2	The land you gave us has been turned over to outsiders . Our homes have been given to strangers .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	3	Our fathers have been killed . Our mothers don ’ t have husbands .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	4	We have to buy the water we drink . We have to pay for the wood we use .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	6	We put ourselves under the control of Egypt and Assyria just to get enough bread .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	7	Our people of long ago sinned . And they are now dead . We are being punished because of their sins .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	8	Slaves rule over us . No one can set us free from their power .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	9	We put our lives in danger just to get some bread to eat . Robbers in the desert might kill us with their swords .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	10	Our skin is as hot as an oven . We are so hungry we ’ re burning up with fever .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	11	Our women have been treated badly in Zion . Our virgins have been treated badly in the towns of Judah .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	12	Our princes have been hung up by their hands . No one shows our elders any respect .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	13	Our young men are forced to grind grain at the mill . Our boys almost fall down as they carry heavy loads of wood .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	14	Our elders don ’ t go to the city gate anymore . Our young men have stopped playing their music .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	15	There isn ’ t any joy in our hearts . Our dancing has turned into mourning .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	16	All of our honor is gone . How terrible it is for us because we have sinned !
NIRV	Lamentations	5	17	So our hearts are weak . Our eyes can ’ t see very clearly .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	18	Mount Zion has been deserted . Wild dogs are prowling all around on it .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	19	Lord , you rule forever . Your throne will last for all time to come .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	20	Why do you always forget us ? Why have you deserted us for so long ?
NIRV	Lamentations	5	21	Lord , please bring us back to you . Then we can return . Make our lives like new again .
NIRV	Lamentations	5	22	Or have you completely turned away from us ? Are you really that angry with us ? Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	1	1	I was
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	30	years old . I was with my people . We had been taken away from our country . We were by the Kebar River in the land of Babylon . On the fifth day of the fourth month , the heavens were opened . I saw visions of God .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	2	It was the fifth day of the month . Jehoiachin had been king of Judah . It was the fifth year since he had been brought to Babylon as a prisoner .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	3	A message from the Lord came to me . I was by the Kebar River in Babylon . The power of the Lord came on me there . I am Ezekiel the priest , the son of Buzi .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	4	I looked up and saw a windstorm coming from the north . I saw a huge cloud . The fire of lightning was flashing out of it . Bright light surrounded it . The center of the fire looked like glowing metal .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	5	I saw in the fire something that looked like four living creatures . They appeared to have the shape of a human being .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	6	But each of them had four faces and four wings .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	7	Their legs were straight . Their feet looked like the feet of a calf . They were as bright as polished bronze .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	8	The creatures had human hands under their wings on their four sides . All four of them had faces and wings .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	9	The wings of one touched the wings of another . Each of the creatures went straight ahead . They didn ’ t change their direction as they moved .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	10	Here ’ s what their faces looked like . Each of the four creatures had the face of a human being . On the right side each had the face of a lion . On the left each had the face of an ox . Each one also had an eagle ’ s face .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	11	That ’ s what their faces looked like . They each had two wings that spread out and lifted up . Each wing touched the wing of another creature on either side . They each had two other wings that covered their bodies .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	12	All the creatures went straight ahead . Anywhere their spirits would lead them to go , they would go . They didn ’ t change their direction as they went .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	13	The living creatures looked like burning coals of fire or like torches . Fire moved back and forth among the creatures . It was bright . Lightning flashed out of it .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	14	The creatures raced back and forth like flashes of lightning .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	15	As I looked at the living creatures , I saw wheels on the ground beside them . Each creature had four faces .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	16	Here ’ s how the wheels looked and worked . They gleamed like topaz . All four of them looked alike . Each one seemed to be made like a wheel inside another wheel at right angles .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	17	The wheels could go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced . The wheels didn ’ t change their direction as the creatures moved .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	18	Their rims were high and terrifying . All four rims were full of eyes all the way around them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	19	When the living creatures moved , the wheels beside them moved . When the creatures rose from the ground , the wheels also rose .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	20	Anywhere their spirits would lead them to go , they would go . And the wheels would rise along with them . That ’ s because the spirits of the living creatures were in the wheels .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	21	When the living creatures moved , the wheels also moved . When the creatures stood still , they also stood still . When the creatures rose from the ground , the wheels rose along with them . That ’ s because the spirits of the living creatures were in the wheels .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	22	Something that looked like a huge space was spread out above the heads of the living creatures . It gleamed like crystal . It was terrifying .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	23	The wings of the creatures were spread out under the space . They reached out toward one another . Each creature had two wings covering its body .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	24	When the living creatures moved , I heard the sound of their wings . It was like the roar of rushing waters . It sounded like the thundering voice of the Mighty God . It was like the loud noise an army makes . When the creatures stood still , they lowered their wings .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	25	Then a voice came from above the huge space over their heads . They stood with their wings lowered .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	26	Above the space over their heads was something that looked like a throne made out of lapis lazuli . On the throne high above was a figure that appeared to be a man .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	27	From his waist up he looked like glowing metal that was full of fire . From his waist down he looked like fire . Bright light surrounded him .
NIRV	Ezekiel	1	28	The glow around him looked like a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day . That ’ s what the glory of the Lord looked like . When I saw it , I fell with my face toward the ground . Then I heard the voice of someone speaking . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	2	2	As he spoke , the Spirit of the Lord came into me . He raised me to my feet . I heard him speaking to me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	2	3	He said , “ Son of man , I am sending you to the people of Israel . That nation has refused to obey me . They have turned against me . They and their people of long ago have been against me to this day .
NIRV	Ezekiel	2	4	The people I am sending you to are very stubborn . Tell them , ‘ Here is what the Lord and King says. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	2	5	They might listen , or they might not . After all , they refuse to obey me . But whether they listen or not , they will know that a prophet was among them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	2	6	Son of man , do not be afraid of them or of what they say . Do not be afraid , even if thorns and bushes are all around you . Do not be afraid , even if you live among scorpions . Do not be afraid of what they say . Do not be terrified by them . They always refuse to obey me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	2	7	You must give them my message . They might listen , or they might not . After all , they refuse to obey me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	2	8	Son of man , listen to what I tell you . Do not be like those who refuse to obey me . Open your mouth . Eat what I give you. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	2	9	Then I looked up . I saw a hand reach out to me . A scroll was in it .
NIRV	Ezekiel	2	10	He unrolled it in front of me . Both sides had words written on them . They spoke about sadness , sorrow and trouble . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	3	3	Then he said to me , “ Son of man , eat this scroll I am giving you . Fill your stomach with it. ” So I ate it . And it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	2	So I opened my mouth . And he gave me the scroll to eat .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	4	Then he said to me , “ Son of man , go to the people of Israel . Give them my message .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	5	I am not sending you to people who speak another language that is hard to learn . Instead , I am sending you to the people of Israel .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	6	You are not being sent to many nations whose people speak other languages that are hard to learn . You would not be able to understand them . Suppose I had sent you to them . Then they certainly would have listened to you .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	7	But the people of Israel do not want to listen to you . That is because they do not want to listen to me . All the Israelites are very stubborn .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	8	But I will make you just as stubborn as they are .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	9	I will make you very brave . So do not be afraid of them . Do not let them terrify you , even though they refuse to obey me. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	10	He continued , “ Son of man , listen carefully . Take to heart everything I tell you .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	11	Go now to your own people who were brought here as prisoners . Speak to them . Tell them , ‘ Here is what the Lord and King says. ’ Speak to them whether they listen or not. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	12	Then the Spirit of the Lord lifted me up . I heard a loud rumbling sound behind me . The sound was made when the glory of the Lord rose up . It rose up from the place it had been standing .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	13	The sound was made by the wings of the living creatures . They were brushing against one another . The sound was also made by the wheels beside them . It was a loud rumbling sound .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	14	Then the Spirit lifted me up and took me away . My spirit was bitter . I was very angry . The power of the Lord was on me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	15	I came to my people who had been brought as prisoners to Tel Aviv . It was near the Kebar River . I went to where they were living . There I sat among them for seven days . I was very sad and scared about everything that had happened . The Lord Has Appointed Ezekiel to Warn Israel
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	16	After seven days , a message from the Lord came to me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	17	The Lord said , “ Son of man , I have appointed you as a prophet to warn the people of Israel . So listen to my message . Give them a warning from me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	18	Suppose I say to a sinful person , ‘ You can be sure you will die. ’ And you do not warn them . You do not try to get them to change their evil ways in order to save their life . Then that sinful person will die because they have sinned . And I will hold you responsible for their death .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	19	But suppose you do warn that sinful person . And they do not turn away from their sin or their evil ways . Then they will die because they have sinned . But you will have saved yourself .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	20	“ Or suppose a godly person turns away from their godliness and does what is evil . And suppose I put something in their way that will trip them up . Then they will die . Since you did not warn them , they will die for their sin . The godly things that person did will not be remembered . And I will hold you responsible for their death .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	21	But suppose you do warn a godly person not to sin . And they do not sin . Then you can be sure that they will live because they listened to your warning . And you will have saved yourself. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	22	The power of the Lord was on me . He said , “ Get up . Go out to the plain . I will speak to you there. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	23	So I got up and went out to the plain . The glory of the Lord was standing there . It was just like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River . So I fell with my face toward the ground .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	24	Then the Spirit of the Lord came into me . He raised me to my feet . He said to me , “ Go , son of man . Shut yourself inside your house .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	25	Some people will tie you up with ropes . So you will not be able to go out among your people .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	26	I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth . Then you will be silent . You will not be able to correct them . That ’ s because they always refuse to obey me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	3	27	But later I will speak to you . I will open your mouth . Then you will tell them , ‘ Here is what the Lord and King says. ’ Those who listen will listen . And those who refuse to listen will refuse . They always refuse to obey me . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	4	4	“ Next , lie down on your left side . Pretend that you are putting Israel ’ s sin on yourself . Keep their sin on you for the number of days you lie on your side .
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	2	Then pretend to surround it and attack it . Make some little models of war machines . Build a ramp up to it . Set camps up around it . Surround it with models of logs to be used for knocking down its gates .
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	3	Then get an iron pan . Put it between you and the city . Pretend it is an iron wall . Turn your face toward the city . It will be under attack when you begin to attack it . That will show the people of Israel what is going to happen to Jerusalem .
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	5	Let each day you lie there stand for one year of their sin . So you will keep Israel ’ s sin on you for
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	390	days you are lying down on your side .
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	6	“ After you have finished this , lie down again . This time lie on your right side . Pretend that you are putting Judah ’ s sin on yourself . Lie there for
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	40	days . That is one day for each year of their sin .
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	7	Next , turn your face toward the model of Jerusalem under attack . Uncover your arm as if you were a soldier ready to fight . Prophesy against the city .
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	8	I will tie you up with ropes . Then you will not be able to turn from one side to the other . You will stay that way until you have finished attacking Jerusalem .
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	9	“ Get some wheat and barley . Also get some beans and lentils . And get some millet and spelt . Put everything in a storage jar . Use it to make some bread for yourself . Eat it during the
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	10	Weigh out eight ounces of food to eat each day . Eat it at your regular mealtimes .
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	11	Also measure out two-thirds of a quart of water . Drink it at your regular mealtimes .
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	12	Eat your food as you would eat a loaf of barley bread . Bake it over human waste in front of the people. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	13	The Lord said , “ That is how the people of Israel will eat ‘ unclean ’ food . They will eat it in the nations where I will drive them. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	14	Then I said , “ No , Lord and King ! I won ’ t do this ! I ’ ve never eaten anything ‘ unclean. ’ From the time I was young until now , I ’ ve never eaten anything that was found dead . And I ’ ve never eaten anything torn apart by wild animals . ‘ Unclean ’ meat has never entered my mouth. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	15	“ All right , ” he said . “ I will let you bake your bread over waste from cows . You can use that instead of human waste. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	16	He continued , “ Son of man , I am about to cut off the food supply in Jerusalem . The people will be worried as they eat their tiny share of food . They will not have any hope as they drink their tiny share of water .
NIRV	Ezekiel	4	17	There will be very little food and water . The people will be shocked as they look at one another . They will become weaker and weaker because of their sin . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	5	5	The Lord and King says , “ What you do with the hair stands for what I will do with Jerusalem ’ s people . I have placed that city in the center of the nations . Countries are all around it .
NIRV	Ezekiel	5	2	Burn up a third of the hair inside the city . Do this when you stop attacking the model of Jerusalem . Next , get another third of the hair . Strike it with a sword all around the city . Then scatter the last third to the winds . That is because I will chase the people with a sword that is ready to strike them down .
NIRV	Ezekiel	5	3	But save a few hairs . Tuck them away in the clothes you are wearing .
NIRV	Ezekiel	5	4	Next , get a few more hairs . Throw them into the fire . Burn them up . The fire will spread to all the people of Israel. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	5	6	But its people are sinful . They have refused to obey my laws and rules . They have turned their backs on my laws . They have not followed my rules . These people are worse than the nations and countries around them. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	5	7	The Lord and King continues , “ You people have been worse than the nations around you . You have not lived by my rules or kept my laws . You have not even lived up to the standards of the nations around you. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	5	8	The Lord and King continues , “ Jerusalem , I myself am against you . I will punish you in the sight of the nations .
NIRV	Ezekiel	5	9	I will do to you what I have never done before and will never do again . That is because you worship statues of gods . I hate them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	5	10	So parents will eat their own children inside the city . And children will eat their parents . I will punish you . And I will scatter to the winds anyone who is left alive .
NIRV	Ezekiel	5	11	You have made my temple ‘ unclean. ’ You have set up statues of all your evil gods . You have done other things I hate . So I will cut you off just like Ezekiel cut off his hair . I will not spare you or feel sorry for you . And that is just as sure as I am alive , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	5	12	A third of your people will die of the plague inside your walls . Or they will die of hunger there . Another third will be killed by swords outside your walls . And I will scatter the last third of your people to the winds . I will chase them with a sword that is ready to strike them down .
NIRV	Ezekiel	5	13	“ Then I will not be angry anymore . My great anger against them will die down . And I will be satisfied . Then they will know that I have spoken with strong feelings . And my great anger toward them will come to an end . I am the Lord .
NIRV	Ezekiel	5	14	“ I will destroy you . I will bring shame on you in the sight of the nations around you . All those who pass by will see it .
NIRV	Ezekiel	5	15	You will be put to shame . The nations will make fun of you . You will serve as a warning to others . They will be shocked when they see you . So I will punish you because I am very angry with you . You will feel the sting of my warning . I have spoken . I am the Lord .
NIRV	Ezekiel	5	16	I will shoot at you with my deadly , destroying arrows of hunger . I will shoot to kill . I will bring more and more hunger on you . I will cut off your food supply .

NIRV	Ezekiel	8	8	He said to me , “ Son of man , dig into the wall. ” So I did . And I saw a door there .
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	2	I looked up and saw a figure that appeared to be human . From his waist down he looked like fire . From his waist up he looked as bright as glowing metal .
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	3	He reached out what appeared to be a hand . He took hold of me by the hair of my head . The Spirit of the Lord lifted me up between earth and heaven . In visions God gave me , the Spirit took me to Jerusalem . He brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the inner courtyard . The statue of a god was standing there . It made God very angry .
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	4	There in front of me was the glory of the God of Israel . It looked just as it did in the vision I had seen on the plain .
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	5	Then the Lord said to me , “ Son of man , look toward the north. ” So I did . I saw a statue that made God angry . It was in the entrance of the gate north of the altar .
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	6	He said to me , “ Son of man , do you see what the Israelites are doing here ? They are doing things I hate very much . Those things will cause me to go far away from my temple . But you will see things I hate even more. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	7	Then he brought me to the entrance to the courtyard . I looked up and saw a hole in the wall .
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	9	He continued , “ Go through it . Look at the evil things they are doing here . I hate those things. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	10	So I went in and looked . All over the walls were pictures of all kinds of crawling things and “ unclean ” animals . The Lord hates it when people worship those things . There were also carvings of the gods of the people of Israel .
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	11	In front of them stood
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	70	elders of Israel . Jaazaniah was standing there among them . He is the son of Shaphan . Each elder was holding a shallow cup . A sweet-smelling cloud of incense was rising from the cups .
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	12	The Lord spoke to me . He said , “ Son of man , do you see what the elders of Israel are doing in the dark ? Each of them is in his own room worshiping his own god . They say , ‘ The Lord doesn ’ t see us . He has deserted the land. ’ ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	13	He continued , “ You will see them doing things I hate even more. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	14	Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the Lord ’ s house . I saw women sitting there . They were mourning for the god named Tammuz .
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	15	The Lord said to me , “ Son of man , do you see what they are doing ? You will see things I hate even more. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	16	Then he brought me into the inner courtyard of the Lord ’ s house . About
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	25	men were there . They were at the entrance to the Lord ’ s temple between the porch and the altar . Their backs were turned toward the temple . Their faces were turned toward the east . And they were bowing down to the sun .
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	17	He said to me , “ Son of man , have you seen all of this ? The people of Judah are doing things here that I hate . This is a very serious matter . They are harming one another all through the land . They continue to make me very angry . Just look at them making fun of me !
NIRV	Ezekiel	8	18	So I am angry with them . I will punish them . I will not spare them or feel sorry for them . They might even shout in my ears . But I will not listen to them. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	9	9	He answered me , “ The sin of Israel and Judah is very great . The land is full of murderers . Its people are not being fair to one another anywhere in Jerusalem . They say , ‘ The Lord has deserted the land . He doesn ’ t see us. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	9	2	I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate . It faces north . Each of them had a deadly weapon in his hand . A man wearing linen clothes came along with them . He was carrying a writing kit at his side . They came in and stood beside the bronze altar .
NIRV	Ezekiel	9	3	The glory of the God of Israel had been above the cherubim . It moved from there to the doorway of the temple . Then the Lord called to the man who was dressed in linen clothes . He had the writing kit .
NIRV	Ezekiel	9	4	The Lord said to him , “ Go all through Jerusalem . Look for those who are sad and sorry about all the things being done there . I hate those things . Put a mark on the foreheads of those people. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	9	5	I heard him speak to the six men . He said , “ Follow him through the city . Do not show any pity or concern .
NIRV	Ezekiel	9	6	Kill the old men and women , the young men and women , and the children . But do not touch anyone who has the mark . Start at my temple. ” So they began with the old men who were in front of the temple .
NIRV	Ezekiel	9	7	Then he said to the men , “ Make the temple ‘ unclean. ’ Fill the courtyards with dead bodies . Go ! ” So they went out and started killing people all through the city .
NIRV	Ezekiel	9	8	While they were doing it , I was left alone . I fell with my face toward the ground . I cried out , “ Lord and King , are you going to destroy all the Israelites who are still left alive ? Will you pour out your great anger on all those who remain in Jerusalem ? ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	9	10	So I will not spare them or feel sorry for them . Anything that happens to them will be their own fault. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	9	11	Then the man wearing linen clothes returned . He had the writing kit . He reported , “ I ’ ve done what you commanded. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	10	10	All four of them looked alike . Each wheel appeared to be inside another wheel at right angles .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	2	The Lord spoke to the man who was wearing linen clothes . He said , “ Go in among the wheels beneath the cherubim . Fill your hands with burning coals from the fire that is among the cherubim . Scatter the coals over the city. ” As I watched , he went in .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	3	The cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in . A cloud filled the inner courtyard .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	4	Then the glory of the Lord rose from above the cherubim . It moved to the doorway of the temple . The cloud filled the temple . And the courtyard was full of the brightness of the glory of the Lord .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	5	The sound the wings of the cherubim made could be heard as far away as the outer courtyard . It was like the voice of the Mighty God when he speaks .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	6	The Lord gave a command to the man who was dressed in linen clothes . He said , “ Get some coals of fire from among the wheels . Take them from among the cherubim. ” So the man went in and stood beside a wheel .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	7	Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand . He picked up some of the burning coals that were among the wheels . He handed them to the man who was wearing linen clothes . The man took them and left .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	8	I saw what looked like human hands . They were under the wings of the cherubim .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	9	I looked up and saw four wheels beside the cherubim . One wheel was beside each of them . The wheels gleamed like topaz .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	11	The wheels could go in any one of the four directions the cherubim faced . The wheels didn ’ t change their direction as the cherubim moved . The cherubim went in the direction their heads faced . They didn ’ t change their direction as they moved .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	12	Their whole bodies were completely covered with eyes . That included their backs , hands and wings . Their four wheels were covered with eyes too .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	13	I heard someone tell the wheels to start spinning around .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	14	Each of the cherubim had four faces . One face was the face of a cherub . The second was the face of a human being . The third was the face of a lion . And the fourth was an eagle ’ s face .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	15	The cherubim rose from the ground . They were the same living creatures I had seen by the Kebar River .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	16	When the cherubim moved , the wheels beside them moved . The cherubim spread their wings to rise from the ground . As they did , the wheels didn ’ t leave their side .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	17	When the cherubim stood still , the wheels also stood still . When the cherubim rose , the wheels rose along with them . That ’ s because the spirits of the living creatures were in the wheels .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	18	Then the glory of the Lord moved away from the doorway of the temple . It stopped above the cherubim .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	19	While I watched , they spread their wings . They rose from the ground . As they went , the wheels went along with them . They stopped at the entrance of the east gate of the Lord ’ s house . And the glory of the God of Israel was above them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	20	These were the same living creatures I had seen by the Kebar River . I had seen them beneath the God of Israel . I realized that they were cherubim .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	21	Each one had four faces and four wings . Under their wings was what looked like human hands .
NIRV	Ezekiel	10	22	Their faces looked the same as the ones I had seen by the Kebar River . Each of the cherubim went straight ahead . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	11	11	This city will not be a pot for you . And you will not be the meat in it . I will judge you at the borders of Israel .
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	25	I told my people everything the Lord had shown me . Copyright ©
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	2	The Lord said to me , “ Son of man , these men are making evil plans . They are giving bad advice to the city .
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	3	They say , ‘ Haven ’ t our houses just been built again ? The city is like a pot used for cooking . And we are the meat in it. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	4	So prophesy against them . Prophesy , son of man. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	5	Then the Spirit of the Lord came on me . He told me to tell them , “ The Lord says , ‘ You leaders in Israel , that is what you are saying . But I know what you are thinking .
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	6	You have killed many people in this city . In fact , you have filled its streets with dead bodies. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	7	“ So the Lord and King says , ‘ The bodies you have thrown there are the meat . And the city is the cooking pot . But I will drive you out of it .
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	8	You are afraid of the swords of war . But I will bring them against you , ’ announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	9	‘ I will drive you out of the city . I will hand you over to outsiders . And I will punish you .
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	10	You will be killed by swords . I will judge you at the borders of Israel . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	12	Then you will know that I am the Lord . You have not obeyed my rules . You have not kept my laws . Instead , you have lived by the standards of the nations around you. ’ ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	13	Pelatiah , the son of Benaiah , died as I was prophesying . Then I fell with my face toward the ground . I cried out in a loud voice . I said , “ Lord and King , will you destroy all the Israelites who are still left alive ? ” The Lord Will Bring His People Back Home
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	14	A message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	15	“ Son of man , the people of Jerusalem have spoken about you . They have spoken about the others the Babylonians have taken away . They have also spoken about all the other people of Israel . The people of Jerusalem have said , ‘ Those people are far away from the Lord . This land was given to us . And it belongs to us. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	16	“ So tell them , ‘ The Lord and King says , “ I sent some of my people far away among the nations . I scattered them among the countries . But for a little while I have been their temple in the countries where they have gone. ” ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	17	“ Tell them , ‘ The Lord and King says , “ I will gather you from the nations . I will bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered . I will give you back the land of Israel. ” ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	18	“ They will return to it . They will remove all its statues of evil gods . I hate those gods .
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	19	I will give my people hearts that are completely committed to me . I will give them a new spirit that is faithful to me . I will remove their stubborn hearts from them . And I will give them hearts that obey me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	20	Then they will follow my rules . They will be careful to keep my laws . They will be my people . And I will be their God .
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	21	But some people have hearts that are committed to worshiping the statues of their evil gods . I hate those gods . Anything that happens to those people will be their own fault , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	22	Then the cherubim spread their wings . The wheels were beside them . The glory of the God of Israel was above them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	23	The glory of the Lord went up from the city . It stopped above the Mount of Olives east of the city .
NIRV	Ezekiel	11	24	The Spirit of God lifted me up . He took me to those who had been brought to Babylon as prisoners . These are the things that happened in the visions the Spirit gave me . Then the visions I had seen were gone .

NIRV	Ezekiel	12	12	“ The prince among them will put his things on his shoulder and leave . He will do this at sunset . Someone will dig a hole in the city wall for him to go through . He will cover his face so he can ’ t see the land .
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	2	“ Son of man , you are living among people who refuse to obey me . They have eyes that can see . But they do not really see . They have ears that can hear . But they do not really hear . They refuse to obey me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	3	“ Son of man , pack your belongings as if you were going on a long trip . Leave in the daytime . Let the people see you . Start out from where you are . Go to another place . Perhaps they will understand the meaning of what you are doing . But they will still refuse to obey me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	4	Bring out your belongings packed for a long trip . Do this during the daytime . Let the people see you . Then in the evening , pretend you are being forced to leave home . Let the people see you .
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	5	While the people are watching , dig through the mud bricks of your house . Then take your belongings out through the hole in the wall .
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	6	Put them on your shoulder . Carry them out at sunset . Let the people see you . Cover your face so you can ’ t see the land . All of that will show the Israelites what is going to happen to them. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	7	So I did just as he commanded me . During the day I brought out my things as if I were going on a long trip . In the evening I dug through the wall of my house with my hands . At sunset I took my belongings out . I put them on my shoulders . The people watched what I was doing .
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	8	In the morning a message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	9	“ Son of man , didn ’ t the Israelites ask you , ‘ What are you doing ? ’ They always refuse to obey me .

NIRV	Ezekiel	12	11	Tell them , ‘ The things I ’ ve done are a picture of what ’ s going to happen to you . “ ‘ So what I ’ ve done will happen to you . You will be forced to leave home . You will be taken to Babylon as prisoners. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	13	I will spread out my net to catch him . He will be caught in my trap . I will bring him to Babylon . It is the land where the Chaldeans live . But he will not see it . He will die there .
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	14	I will scatter to the winds all those around him . I will scatter his officials and all his troops . And I will chase them with a sword that is ready to strike them down .
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	15	“ They will know that I am the Lord when I scatter them among the nations . I will send them to other countries .
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	16	But I will spare a few of them . I will save them from war , hunger and plague . In those countries they will admit they have done all kinds of evil things . I hate those things . They will know that I am the Lord. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	17	A message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	18	“ Son of man , tremble with fear as you eat your food . Tremble as you drink your water .
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	19	Speak to the people of the land . Say to them , ‘ Here is what the Lord and King says . He says this about those who live in Jerusalem and Israel . “ They will be worried as they eat their food . They will not have any hope as they drink their water . Their land will be stripped of everything in it because all those who live there are harming one another .
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	20	The towns where people live will be completely destroyed . The land will become a dry and empty desert . Then you will know that I am the Lord. ” ’ ” The Lord ’ s Judgment Will Come Soon
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	21	A message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	22	“ Son of man , you have a proverb in the land of Israel . It says , ‘ The days go by , and not even one vision comes true. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	23	Tell them , ‘ The Lord and King says , “ I am going to put an end to this proverb . They will not use that saying in Israel anymore. ” ’ Tell them , ‘ The days are coming soon when every vision will come true .
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	24	There will be no more false visions . People will no longer use magic to find out whether good things are going to happen in Israel .
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	25	I am the Lord . So I will say what I want to . And it will come true when I want it to . In your days I will do everything I say I will . But you people always refuse to obey me , ’ announces the Lord and King. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	12	26	A message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,

NIRV	Ezekiel	16	21	You killed my children . You sacrificed them to other gods .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	22	You did not remember the days when you were young . At that time you were completely naked . You were kicking around in your blood . But now you have done evil things . I hate them . You have worshiped other gods . You have not been faithful to me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	23	“ ‘ “ How terrible it will be for you ! ” announces the Lord and King . “ How terrible for you ! You continued to sin against me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	24	Your people built up mounds for themselves in every market . They put little places of worship on them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	25	They set them up at every street corner . Jerusalem , you misused your beauty . You offered your body to anyone who passed by . You did it again and again .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	26	You committed shameful acts with the people of Egypt . They were your neighbors who were ready to have sex with you . You offered yourself to them again and again . That made me very angry .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	27	So I reached out my powerful hand against you . I made your territory smaller . I handed you over to your Philistine enemies . The people in their towns were shocked by your impure conduct .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	28	You also committed shameful acts with the people of Assyria . Nothing ever seemed to satisfy you . You could never get enough .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	29	Then you offered yourself to the people of Babylon . But that did not satisfy you either . There are many traders in the land of Babylon .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	30	“ ‘ “ I am filled with great anger against you , ” announces the Lord and King . “ Just look at all the things you are doing ! You are acting like a prostitute who has no shame at all .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	31	Your people built up mounds at every street corner . You put little places of worship on them in every market . But you did not really act like a prostitute . That ’ s because you refused to let your lovers pay you anything .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	32	“ ‘ “ You unfaithful wife ! You would rather be with strangers than with your own husband !
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	33	Every prostitute receives gifts . Instead , you give gifts to all your lovers . You offer them money to come to you from everywhere . You want them to sleep with you . You are not faithful to me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	34	As a prostitute , you are the opposite of others . No one runs after you to sleep with you . You are exactly the opposite . You pay them . They do not pay you. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	35	You prostitute , listen to the Lord ’ s message .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	36	The Lord and King says , “ You poured out your desire on your lovers . You took off your clothing and slept with them . You did it again and again . You worshiped other gods . I hate them . You even sacrificed your children to them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	37	So I am going to gather together all the lovers you found pleasure with . They include those you loved and those you hated . I will gather them against you from everywhere . I will take your clothes off right in front of them . Then they will see you completely naked .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	38	I will hand down my sentence against you . You will be punished like women who commit adultery and sacrifice their children to other gods . I am so angry with you . So I will sentence you to death for everything you have done .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	39	Then I will hand you over to your lovers . They will tear down those mounds you built . They will destroy the little places of worship you put on them . They will take your clothes off . They will remove your fine jewelry . And they will leave you completely naked .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	40	They will bring a crowd against you . The crowd will put you to death by throwing stones at you . And they will chop you to pieces with their swords .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	41	They will burn down your houses and punish you . Many women will see it . I will not let you be a prostitute anymore . You will no longer pay your lovers .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	42	Then my great anger against you will die down . My jealous anger will turn away from you . I will be calm . I will not be angry anymore .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	43	“ You did not remember the days when you were young . The things you did made me very angry . So anything that happens to you will be your own fault , ” announces the Lord and King . “ You added impure conduct to all the other evil things you did . I hate all those things .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	44	“ All those who use proverbs will use this one about you . They will say , ‘ Like mother , like daughter. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	45	You are a true daughter of your mother . She hated her husband and children . And you are a true sister of your sisters . They hated their husbands and children . Your mother was a Hittite . Your father was an Amorite .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	46	Your older sister was Samaria . She lived north of you with her daughters . Your younger sister was Sodom . She lived south of you with her daughters .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	47	You lived exactly the way they did . You copied their evil practices . I hate those practices . Everything you did was so sinful that you soon became even worse than they were .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	48	Your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you and your daughters have done . And that is just as sure as I am alive , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	49	“ Here is the sin your sister Sodom committed . She and her daughters were proud . They ate too much . They were not concerned about others . They did not help those who were poor and in need .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	50	They were very proud . They did many things that were evil in my eyes . I hated those things . So I got rid of Sodom and her daughters , just as you have seen .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	51	Samaria did not commit half the sins you did . You sinned even more than they did . I hate those sins . Compared to what you did , you made your sisters seem godly .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	52	So you will be dishonored . You have given your sisters an excuse for what they did . Your sins were far worse than theirs . In fact , your sisters appear to be more godly than you . So then , be ashamed . You will be dishonored . You have made them appear to be godly .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	53	“ I will not only give you back what you had before . I will also do the same thing for Sodom and her daughters . And I will do the same for Samaria and her daughters .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	54	That will make you feel dishonored . You will be ashamed of everything you have done . You have made them feel better because you sinned more and were punished more than they were .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	55	Your sisters Sodom and Samaria and their daughters will return to what they were before . And you and your daughters will return to what you were before .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	56	In the past you would not even mention your sister Sodom . You were proud at that time .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	57	That was before your sin was uncovered . Now the daughters of Edom make fun of you . So do all her neighbors and the daughters of the Philistines . Everyone who lives around you hates you .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	58	You will be punished for your impure conduct . I will also punish you for the other evil things you have done . I hate all those things , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	59	The Lord and King says , “ I will punish you in keeping with what you have done . I sealed with a promise the covenant I made with you . You hated that promise . And you broke my covenant .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	60	But I will remember my covenant with you . I made it with you when you were young . Now I will make a new covenant with you . It will last forever .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	61	Then you will remember how you have lived . You will be ashamed when I give you Samaria and Sodom . Samaria is your older sister . Sodom is your younger one . I will give them and their daughters to you as daughters . That can ’ t happen based on my old covenant with you .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	62	So I will make my new covenant with you . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
NIRV	Ezekiel	16	63	I will pay for all the sins you have committed . Then you will remember what you have done . You will be ashamed of it . Because of your shame , you will never speak against me again , ” announces the Lord and King . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	17	17	So Nebuchadnezzar will build ramps against the walls of Jerusalem . He will set up war machines to destroy many lives . Pharaoh will not be able to help Zedekiah during the war . The huge and mighty army of Egypt will not be of any help .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	2	“ Son of man , tell the people of Israel a story about their kings . Let them know what will happen to them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	3	Tell them , ‘ The Lord and King says , “ A great eagle came to the city of ‘ Lebanon. ’ It had powerful wings and a lot of long feathers . The feathers were colorful and beautiful . The eagle landed in the top of a cedar tree .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	4	It broke off the highest twig . The eagle carried it away to the land of Babylon . There are many traders in that land . The eagle planted the twig in the city of Babylon .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	5	“ ‘ “ Then it took from the land a seed that had just sprouted . It put it in rich soil near plenty of water . It planted the seed like a willow tree .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	6	The seed grew into a low , spreading vine . Its branches turned toward the eagle . And its roots remained under the eagle . So the seed became a vine . It produced branches and put out leaves .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	7	“ ‘ “ But there was another great eagle . It also had powerful wings and a lot of feathers . The vine now sent out its roots toward that eagle . It sent them out from the place where it was planted . And it reached out its branches to the eagle for water .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	8	The seed had been planted in good soil near plenty of water . Then it could produce branches and bear fruit . It could become a beautiful vine. ” ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	9	“ Ezekiel , tell the Israelites , ‘ The Lord and King asks , “ Will the vine grow ? Won ’ t it be pulled up by its roots ? Won ’ t all its fruit be stripped off ? Won ’ t it dry up ? All its new growth will dry up . It will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it up .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	10	It has been planted , but will it grow ? No . It will dry up completely when the east wind strikes it . It will dry up in the place where it grew. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	11	A message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	12	“ These people refuse to obey me . Ask them , ‘ Don ’ t you know what these things mean ? ’ Tell them , ‘ Nebuchadnezzar went to Jerusalem . He was the king of Babylon . He carried off King Jehoiachin and the nobles . He brought them back with him to the city of Babylon .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	13	Then Nebuchadnezzar made a peace treaty with Zedekiah . He was a member of Jerusalem ’ s royal family . Nebuchadnezzar made him promise he would keep the treaty . He also took away the leading men of the land as prisoners .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	14	He did it to bring down their kingdom . It would not rise again . In fact , it would be able to last only by keeping his treaty .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	15	But Zedekiah turned against him . He sent messengers to Egypt . They went there to get horses and a large army . Will he succeed ? Will he who does things like that escape ? Can he break the peace treaty and still escape ?
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	16	“ ‘ Zedekiah will die in Babylon , ’ announces the Lord and King . ‘ And that is just as sure as I am alive . He will die in the land of King Nebuchadnezzar , who put him on the throne . Zedekiah didn ’ t keep his promise to Nebuchadnezzar and broke his treaty .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	18	Zedekiah didn ’ t keep his promise to Nebuchadnezzar and broke his treaty . Zedekiah had made a firm promise to keep it . But he broke it anyway . So he will not escape .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	19	“ ‘ The Lord and King says , “ Zedekiah didn ’ t keep the promise he made in my name . He broke the treaty . So I will pay him back . And that is just as sure as I am alive .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	20	I will spread out my net to catch him . He will be caught in my trap . I will bring him to Babylon . I will judge him there because he was not faithful to me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	21	All Zedekiah ’ s best troops will be killed by swords . Those who are left alive will be scattered to the winds . Then you will know that I have spoken . I am the Lord. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	22	“ ‘ The Lord and King says , “ I myself will get a twig from the very top of a cedar tree and plant it . I will break off the highest twig . I will plant it on a very high mountain .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	23	I will plant it on the high mountains of Israel . It will produce branches and bear fruit . It will become a beautiful cedar tree . All kinds of birds will make their nests in it . They will live in the shade of its branches .
NIRV	Ezekiel	17	24	All the trees in the forest will know that I bring down tall trees . I make short trees grow tall . I dry up green trees . And I make dry trees green. ” “ ‘ I have spoken . I will do this . I am the Lord. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	19	2	Say to Israel , “ ‘ You were like a mother lion to your princes . She lay down among the lions . She brought up her cubs .
NIRV	Ezekiel	19	3	One of them was Jehoahaz . He became a strong lion . He learned to tear apart what he caught . And he became a man-eater .
NIRV	Ezekiel	19	4	The nations heard about him . They trapped him in their pit . They put hooks in his face . And they led him away to Egypt .
NIRV	Ezekiel	19	5	“ ‘ The mother lion looked and waited . But all her hope was gone . So she got another one of her cubs . She made him into a strong lion .

NIRV	Ezekiel	19	7	He broke down their forts . He completely destroyed their towns . The land and all those who were in it were terrified when he roared .
NIRV	Ezekiel	19	8	Then nations came against him . They came from all around him . They spread out their net to catch him . He was trapped in their pit .
NIRV	Ezekiel	19	9	They used hooks to pull him into a cage . They brought him to the king of Babylon . They put him in prison . So his roar was not heard anymore on the mountains of Israel .

NIRV	Ezekiel	19	13	Now it is planted in the Babylonian desert . It is in a dry and thirsty land .
NIRV	Ezekiel	19	14	One of its main branches was Zedekiah . Fire spread from it and burned up its fruit . None of its branches is good enough to be made into a ruler ’ s scepter. ’ This is a song of sadness . And that is how it should be used . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	20	20	Keep my Sabbath days holy . That is the sign of the covenant I made with you . You will know that I am the Lord your God. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	2	Then a message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	3	“ Son of man , speak to the elders of Israel . Tell them , ‘ The Lord and King says , “ Have you come to ask me for advice ? I will not let you do that , ” announces the Lord and King . “ And that is just as sure as I am alive. ” ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	4	“ Are you going to judge them , son of man ? Will you judge them ? Tell them the evil things done by their people of long ago . I hate those things .
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	5	Tell them , ‘ The Lord and King says , “ I chose Israel . On that day I raised my hand and made a promise . I made a promise to the members of Jacob ’ s family line . I made myself known to them in Egypt . I raised my hand and told them , ‘ I am the Lord your God. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	6	On that day I promised I would bring them out of Egypt . I told them I would take them to a land I had found for them . It had plenty of milk and honey . It was the most beautiful land of all .
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	7	I said to them , ‘ Each of you must get rid of the statues of the evil gods you worship . Do not make yourselves “ unclean ” by worshiping the gods of Egypt . I am the Lord your God. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	8	“ ‘ “ But they refused to obey me . They would not listen to me . They did not get rid of the evil gods they worshiped . And they did not turn away from Egypt ’ s gods . So I said I would pour out all my great anger on them in Egypt .
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	9	I wanted my name to be honored . So I brought my people out of Egypt . I did it to keep my name from being treated as if it were not holy . I didn ’ t want this to happen in front of the nations around my people . I had made myself known to Israel in the sight of those nations .
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	10	So I led them out of Egypt . I brought them into the Desert of Sinai .
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	11	I gave them my rules . I made my laws known to them . The person who obeys them will live by them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	12	I also told them to observe my Sabbath days . That is the sign of the covenant I made with them . I wanted them to know that I made them holy . I am the Lord .

NIRV	Ezekiel	20	14	But I wanted my name to be honored . I kept it from being treated as if it were not holy . I did not want that to happen in front of the nations . They had seen me bring Israel out of Egypt .
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	15	I also raised my hand and made a promise in the desert . I told my people I would not bring them into the land I had given them . It had plenty of milk and honey . It was the most beautiful land of all .
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	16	But they turned their backs on my laws . They did not obey my rules . They misused my Sabbath days . Their hearts were committed to worshiping the statues of their gods .
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	17	Then I felt sorry for them . So I did not destroy them . I did not put an end to them in the desert .
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	18	I spoke to their children there . I said , ‘ Do not follow the rules your parents gave you . Do not obey their laws . Do not make yourselves “ unclean ” by worshiping their gods .
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	19	I am the Lord your God . So follow my rules . Be careful to obey my laws .

NIRV	Ezekiel	20	23	I also raised my hand and made a promise in the desert . I told my people I would scatter them among the nations . I would send them to other countries .
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	24	They had not obeyed my laws . They had turned their backs on my rules . They had misused my Sabbath days . They only wanted to worship the statues of their parents ’ gods .
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	25	So I let them follow other rules . Those other rules were not good . I let them have laws they could not live by .
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	26	I let them become ‘ unclean ’ by offering sacrifices to other gods . They even sacrificed the first male child born in each family . I wanted to fill them with horror . Then they would know that I am the Lord. ” ’

NIRV	Ezekiel	20	29	Then I said to them , ‘ What is this high place you go to ? ’ ” ’ ” That high place is called Bamah to this day . The Lord Makes Israel New Again
NIRV	Ezekiel	20	30	The Lord said to me , “ Speak to the Israelites . Tell them , ‘ Here is what the Lord and King says . “ Are you going to make yourselves ‘ unclean ’ the way your people of long ago did ? Are you also going to want to worship the statues of their evil gods ?

NIRV	Ezekiel	21	21	The king of Babylon will stop at the place where the two roads meet . He will look for a special sign . He will cast lots by pulling arrows out of a bag . He will ask his gods for advice . And he will look carefully at the liver of a sheep .
NIRV	Ezekiel	21	2	“ Son of man , turn your attention to Jerusalem . Preach against the temple . Prophesy against the land of Israel .

NIRV	Ezekiel	21	7	They will ask you , ‘ Why are you groaning ? ’ Then you will say , ‘ Because of the news that is coming . The hearts of all the people will melt away in fear .

NIRV	Ezekiel	21	8	A message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,

NIRV	Ezekiel	21	11	The Lord says , “ I have told Nebuchadnezzar to shine his sword . It is in his hand . It has been sharpened and shined . It is ready for the killer ’ s hand .
NIRV	Ezekiel	21	12	Son of man , cry out and weep . The sword is against my people . It is against all the princes of Israel . It will kill them along with the rest of my people . So beat your chest in sorrow .
NIRV	Ezekiel	21	13	“ You can be sure that testing will come . Why does the sword look down on the scepter ? Because even the scepter will not continue to rule , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	21	14	“ Son of man , prophesy . Clap your hands . Let the sword strike twice . Let it strike even three times . It is a sword to kill people . It is a sword to kill many people . It is closing in on them from every side .
NIRV	Ezekiel	21	15	People ’ s hearts will melt away in fear . Many will be wounded or killed . I have prepared the sword to kill people at all their city gates . Look ! It strikes like lightning . It is in the killer ’ s hand .

NIRV	Ezekiel	21	17	I too will clap my hands . I won ’ t be so angry anymore . I have spoken . I am the Lord. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	21	18	A message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Ezekiel	21	19	“ Son of man , mark out on a map two roads for the sword to take . The sword belongs to the king of Babylon . Both roads start from the same country . Put up a sign where the road turns off to the city of Rabbah .
NIRV	Ezekiel	21	20	Mark out one road for the sword to take against Rabbah in Ammon . Mark out another against Judah and the walls of Jerusalem .
NIRV	Ezekiel	21	22	His right hand will pull out the arrow for Jerusalem . There he will get huge logs ready to knock down its gates . He will give the command to kill its people . He will sound the battle cry . He will build a ramp up to the city wall . He will bring in his war machines .
NIRV	Ezekiel	21	23	The decision to attack Jerusalem will seem like the wrong advice to those who made a treaty with Nebuchadnezzar . But he will remind them that they are guilty . And he will take them away as prisoners. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	21	24	So the Lord and King says , “ You people have reminded everyone of how guilty you are . You have done it by refusing to obey me or any other authority . Everything you do clearly shows how sinful you are . So you will be taken away as prisoners. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	21	25	King Zedekiah , your day has come . You are an unholy and evil prince in Israel . The day for you to be punished is here .
NIRV	Ezekiel	21	26	The Lord and King says , “ Take off your turban . Remove your crown . Things will not be as they were in the past . Those who are considered not important will be honored . And those who are honored will be considered not important .
NIRV	Ezekiel	21	27	Jerusalem will fall . I will destroy it . It will not be rebuilt until the true king comes . After all , the kingdom belongs to him . I will give it to him .

A sword ! Nebuchadnezzar ’ s sword is ready to kill you . It is shined to destroy you . It flashes like lightning .
NIRV	Ezekiel	21	29	The visions of your prophets are false . They use magic to try to find out what is going to happen to you . But their magic tricks are lies . The sword will strike the necks of you sinful people . You will be killed . The day for you to be punished has finally come . Your time is up .
NIRV	Ezekiel	21	30	Ammon , return your sword to its place . In the land where you were created , I will judge you . That is where you came from .

NIRV	Ezekiel	23	23	They include the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans . They include the men from Pekod , Shoa and Koa . They also include all the Assyrians . They are young and handsome . Some of them are governors and commanders . Others are chariot officers . Still others are very high officials . All of them ride horses .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	2	“ Son of man , once there were two women . They had the same mother .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	3	They became prostitutes in Egypt . They have been unfaithful to me since they were young . In that land they allowed their breasts to be touched . They permitted their virgin breasts to be kissed .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	4	The older sister was named Oholah . The younger one was Oholibah . They belonged to me . Sons and daughters were born to them . Oholah stands for Samaria . And Oholibah stands for Jerusalem .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	5	“ Oholah was unfaithful to me even while she still belonged to me . She longed for her Assyrian lovers . They included soldiers
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	6	who wore blue uniforms . They also included governors and commanders . All of them were young and handsome . They rode horses .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	7	She gave herself as a prostitute to all Assyria ’ s finest warriors . She made herself impure with the statues of the gods of everyone she longed for .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	8	She started being a prostitute in Egypt . And she never stopped . When she was young , men had sex with her . They kissed her virgin breasts . They used up all their sinful desires on her .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	9	“ So I handed her over to her Assyrian lovers . She longed for them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	10	They stripped her naked . They took away her sons and daughters . And they killed her with their swords . Other women laughed when that happened . I was the one who had punished her .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	11	“ Her sister Oholibah saw it . But her evil desire for sexual sin was worse than her sister ’ s .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	12	She too longed for the men of Assyria . They included governors and commanders . They included soldiers who wore fancy uniforms . They also included men who rode horses . All of them were young and handsome .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	13	I saw that she too made herself impure . So both sisters did the same evil things .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	14	“ But Oholibah went even further with her sexual sins . She saw pictures of men drawn on a wall . They were figures of Babylonians drawn in red .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	15	They had belts around their waists . They wore flowing turbans on their heads . All of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers . They were from the land of the Chaldeans .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	16	As soon as she saw the pictures , she longed for the men . So she sent messengers to them in Babylon .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	17	Then the Babylonians came to her . They went to bed with her . They had sex with her . They made her impure when they had sex with her . After they did it , she became sick of them . So she turned away from them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	18	She acted like a prostitute who had no shame at all . She openly showed her naked body . I became sick of what she was doing . So I turned away from her . I had also turned away from her sister .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	19	But Oholibah offered her body to her lovers again and again . She remembered the days when she was a young prostitute in Egypt .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	20	There she had longed for her lovers . Their private parts seemed as big as those of donkeys . And their flow of semen appeared to be as much as that of horses .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	21	So you wanted to return to the days when you were young . You longed for the time when you first became impure in Egypt . That was when you allowed your breasts to be kissed . And you permitted your young breasts to be touched. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	22	So the Lord and King says , “ Oholibah , I will stir up your lovers against you . You became sick of them . You turned away from them . But I will bring them against you from every side .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	24	So a huge army will come against you with weapons , chariots and wagons . They will take up positions against you on every side . They will carry large and small shields . They will wear helmets . I will turn you over to them to be punished . They will punish you in their own way .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	25	I will pour out my jealous anger on you . And the army ’ s anger will burn against you . They will cut off your noses and ears . Some of you who are left will be killed by swords . They will take away your sons and daughters . Others of you who are left will be burned up .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	26	The army will also strip off your clothes . They will take your fine jewelry away from you .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	27	You became an impure prostitute in Egypt . But I will put a stop to all of that . You will no longer want to do any of it . You will not remember Egypt anymore. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	28	The Lord and King says , “ I am about to hand you over to people you hate . You became sick of them . You turned away from them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	29	They will punish you because they hate you so much . They will take away from you everything you have worked for . They will leave you completely naked . Then everyone will see that you are a prostitute who has no shame at all . You were impure . You offered your body to your lovers again and again .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	30	That is why you will be punished . You longed for lovers in other nations . You made yourself impure by worshiping their gods .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	31	You did the same things your sister Oholah did . So I will put her cup in your hand . It is filled with the wine of my anger. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	32	The Lord and King says to Oholibah , “ You will drink from your sister ’ s cup . It is large and deep . It is filled with the wine of my anger . So others will laugh at you . They will make fun of you .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	33	You will become drunk and sad . The cup of my anger will completely destroy you . It is the same cup your sister Samaria drank from .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	34	You will drink from it until it is empty . Then you will chew on its pieces . And you will claw at your breasts . I have spoken , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	35	So the Lord and King says , “ You have forgotten me . You have turned your back on me . You have been impure . You have acted like a prostitute . So I will punish you. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	36	The Lord said to me , “ Son of man , are you going to judge Oholah and Oholibah ? Then tell them they have done many evil things . I hate those things .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	37	They have committed adultery . Their hands are covered with the blood of the people they have murdered . They have worshiped other gods . They have not been faithful to me . They have even sacrificed their children as food to other gods . Those children belonged to me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	38	Here are some other things the sisters have done to me . They have made my temple ‘ unclean. ’ They have misused my Sabbath days .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	39	They have sacrificed their children to their gods . On that same day they entered my temple and made it ‘ unclean. ’ That is what they have done in my house .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	40	“ They even sent messengers to bring men from far away . When the men arrived , Oholibah took a bath . She put makeup on her eyes . She put her jewelry on .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	41	She sat down on a beautiful couch . A table was in front of it . There she put the incense and olive oil that belonged to me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	42	“ The noise of a carefree crowd was all around her . Men who drink too much were brought from the desert . Other men were brought along with them . They put bracelets on the wrists of the two sisters . They put beautiful crowns on their heads .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	43	Then I spoke about Oholibah . She was worn out by adultery . I said , ‘ Let them use her as a prostitute . After all , that is what she is. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	44	So they slept with her . In fact , they slept with both of these impure women , Oholah and Oholibah . They slept with them just as men sleep with prostitutes .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	45	But judges who are right with God will sentence the sisters to be punished . They will be punished in the same way as women who commit adultery and murder . After all , they have committed adultery . And their hands are covered with the blood of the people they have murdered. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	46	The Lord and King says , “ Bring an angry crowd against the sisters . Hand them over to those who will terrify them and steal everything they have .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	47	The crowd will kill them by throwing stones at them . They will use swords to cut them down . They will kill their sons and daughters . And they will burn down their houses .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	48	“ So I will put an end to impurity in the land . Then all its women will be warned . They will not want to be like the sisters .
NIRV	Ezekiel	23	49	Those sisters will be punished because of the impure things they have done . They will be judged because they have worshiped other gods . Then they will know that I am the Lord and King. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	24	9	So the Lord and King said to me , “ How terrible it will be for this city ! It has so many murderers in it . I too will pile the wood high .
NIRV	Ezekiel	24	10	So pile on the wood . Light the fire . Cook the meat well . Mix in the spices . Let the bones be blackened .
NIRV	Ezekiel	24	11	Then set the empty pot on the coals . Let it get hot . Let its copper glow . Then what is not pure in it will melt . Its scum will be burned away .
NIRV	Ezekiel	24	12	But it can ’ t be cleaned up . Its thick scum has not been removed . Even fire can ’ t burn it off .

NIRV	Ezekiel	24	17	Groan quietly . Do not mourn for your wife when she dies . Keep your turban on your head . Keep your sandals on your feet . Do not cover your mustache and beard . Do not eat the food people eat to comfort them when someone dies. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	24	18	So I spoke to my people in the morning . And in the evening my wife died . The next morning I did what I had been commanded to do .
NIRV	Ezekiel	24	19	Then the people said to me , “ Tell us what these things have to do with us . Why are you acting like this ? ”

It is the beautiful building you are so proud of . You take delight in it . You love it . The sons and daughters you left behind will be killed by swords .

NIRV	Ezekiel	31	31	It was the 11th year since King Jehoiachin had been brought to Babylon as a prisoner . On the first day of the third month , a message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	2	“ Son of man , speak to Pharaoh Hophra , the king of Egypt . Also speak to his huge army . Tell him , “ ‘ Who can be compared with your majesty ?
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	3	Think about what happened to Assyria . Once it was like a cedar tree in Lebanon . It had beautiful branches that provided shade for the forest . It grew very high . Its top was above all the leaves .
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	4	The waters fed it . Deep springs made it grow tall . Their streams flowed all around its base . They made their way to all the trees in the fields .
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	5	So it grew higher than any other tree in the fields . It grew more limbs . Its branches grew long . They spread because they had plenty of water .
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	6	All the birds in the sky made their nests in its limbs . All the wild animals had their babies under its branches . All the great nations lived in its shade .
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	7	Its spreading branches made it majestic and beautiful . Its roots went down deep to where there was plenty of water .
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	8	The cedar trees in my garden were no match for it . The juniper trees could not equal its limbs . The plane trees could not compare with its branches . No tree in my garden could match its beauty .
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	9	I gave it many branches . They made it beautiful . All the trees in my Garden of Eden were jealous of it. ’ ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	10	So the Lord and King says , “ The great cedar tree grew very high . Its top was above all the leaves . It was proud of how tall it was .
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	11	So I handed it over to the Babylonian ruler of the nations . I wanted him to punish it because it was so evil . I decided to get rid of it .
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	12	The Babylonians cut it down and left it there . They did not show it any pity at all . Some of its branches fell on the mountains . Others fell in all the valleys . The branches lay broken in all the stream beds in the land . All the nations on earth came out from under its shade . And they went on their way .
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	13	All the birds settled on the fallen tree . All the wild animals lived among its branches .
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	14	So trees that receive plenty of water must never grow so high that it makes them proud . Their tops must never be above the rest of the leaves . No other trees that receive a lot of water must ever grow that high . They are appointed to die and go down into the earth below . They will join human beings , who go down to the place of the dead. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	15	The Lord and King says , “ Assyria was like a cedar tree . But I brought it down to the place of the dead . On that day I dried up the deep springs of water and covered them . I held its streams back . I shut off its rich supply of water . Because of that , Lebanon was dressed in gloom as if it were clothes . All the trees in the fields dried up .
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	16	I brought the cedar tree down to the place of the dead . It joined the other nations that go down there . I made the nations on earth shake because of the sound of its fall . Then all the trees of Eden were comforted in the earth below . That included the finest and best trees in Lebanon . And it included all the trees that received plenty of water .
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	17	Others also went down along with the cedar tree into the place of the dead . They included those who had been killed by swords . They also included the armed men among the nations who lived in its shade .
NIRV	Ezekiel	31	18	“ Which one of the trees of Eden can be compared with you ? What tree is as glorious and majestic as you are ? But you too will be brought down to the earth below . There you will join the trees of Eden . You will lie down with those who have not been circumcised . You will be among those who were killed by swords . “ That is what will happen to Pharaoh and his huge armies , ” announces the Lord and King . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	32	32	“ I let Pharaoh spread terror while he was alive . But now he and his huge armies will be buried with those who had not been circumcised . They will lie down there with those who were killed by swords , ” announces the Lord and King . Copyright ©
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	2	“ Son of man , sing a song of sadness about Pharaoh Hophra , the king of Egypt . Tell him , “ ‘ You are like a lion among the nations . You are like a monster in the sea . You move around wildly in your rivers . You churn the water with your feet . You make the streams muddy. ’ ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	3	The Lord and King says , “ I will use a large crowd of people to throw my net over you . They will pull you up in it .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	4	Then I will throw you on the land . I will toss you into an open field . I will let all the birds in the sky settle on you . I will let all the wild animals eat you up .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	5	I will scatter the parts of your body all over the mountains . I will fill the valleys with your remains .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	6	I will soak the land with your blood . It will flow all the way to the mountains . The valleys will be filled with the parts of your body .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	7	When I wipe you out , I will put a cover over the heavens . I will darken the stars . I will cover the sun with a cloud . The moon will stop shining .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	8	I will darken all the bright lights in the sky above you . I will bring darkness over your land , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	9	“ The hearts of many people will be troubled . That is because I will destroy you among the nations . You had never known anything about those lands before .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	10	Many nations will be shocked when they see what has happened to you . Their kings will tremble with fear when they find out about it . I will get ready to use Nebuchadnezzar as my sword against them . On the day you fall from power , each of the kings will tremble with fear . Each will be afraid he is the next to die. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	11	The Lord and King says , “ I will send against you the sword of the king of Babylon .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	12	years after that , the message came . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	13	I will destroy all its cattle from the places where they have plenty of water . Human feet will never stir up the water again . The hooves of cattle will not make it muddy anymore .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	14	I will let the waters of Egypt settle . I will make its streams flow like olive oil , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	15	“ I will turn Egypt into an empty land . I will strip away everything in it . I will strike down everyone who lives there . Then they will know that I am the Lord .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	16	“ That is the song of sadness people will sing about Egypt . Women from other nations will sing it . They will weep over Egypt and its huge armies , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	17	A message from the Lord came to me . King Jehoiachin had been brought to Babylon as a prisoner . On the 15th day of a month
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	18	“ Son of man , weep over the huge army of Egypt . Tell the Egyptians they will go down into the earth below . The women singers from the other mighty nations will go down into the grave along with them and others .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	19	Tell them , ‘ Are you any better than others ? Since you are not , go down there . Lie down with those who have not been circumcised. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	20	They will fall dead among those who were killed by swords . Nebuchadnezzar is ready to use his sword against them . Let Egypt be dragged off together with its huge armies .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	21	The mighty leaders who are already in the place of the dead will talk about Egypt . They will also speak about the nations that were going to help it . They will say , ‘ They have come down here . They are lying down with those who had not been circumcised . They are here with those who were killed by swords. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	22	“ Assyria is there with its whole army . Its king is surrounded by the graves of all its people who were killed by swords .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	23	Their graves are deep down in the pit . Assyria ’ s army lies around the grave of its king . All those who spread terror while they were alive are now dead . They were killed by swords .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	24	“ Elam is also there . Its huge armies lie around the grave of its king . All those who spread terror while they were alive are now dead . They were killed by swords . They had not been circumcised . They went down into the earth below . Their shame is like the shame of others who go down into the grave .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	25	A bed is made for Elam ’ s king among the dead . His huge armies lie around his grave . They had not been circumcised . They were killed by swords . They had spread terror while they were alive . So now their shame is like the shame of others who go down into the grave . They lie down among the dead .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	26	“ Meshek and Tubal are also there . Their huge armies lie around the graves of their kings . None of them had been circumcised . They had spread their terror while they were alive . So they were killed by swords .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	27	But they do not lie down with the other dead soldiers of long ago . Those soldiers and their weapons had gone down into the place of the dead . Their swords had been placed under their heads . Their shields rest on their bones . The soldiers of Meshek and Tubal do not lie down with them . This is true even though they had also spread terror while they were alive .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	28	“ Pharaoh Hophra , you too will be broken . You will lie down among those who had not been circumcised . You will be there with those who were killed by swords .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	29	“ Edom is also there . So are its kings and all its princes . In spite of their power , they lie down with those who were killed by swords . They lie down with those who had not been circumcised . They are there with others who went down into the grave .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	30	“ All the princes of the north are there too . So are all the people of Sidon . They went down into the grave in dishonor . While they were alive , they used their power to spread terror . They had never been circumcised . But now they lie down there with those who were killed by swords . Their shame is like the shame of others who go down into the grave .
NIRV	Ezekiel	32	31	“ Pharaoh and his whole army will see all of them . That will comfort him even though his huge armies were killed by swords. ” This is what the Lord and King announces .

NIRV	Ezekiel	33	33	“ Everything I have told you will come true . You can be sure of it . Then the people will know that a prophet has been among them. ” Copyright ©
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	2	“ Son of man , speak to your people . Tell them , ‘ Suppose I send enemies against a land . And its people choose one of their men to stand guard .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	3	He sees the enemies coming against the land . He blows a trumpet to warn the people .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	4	Someone hears the trumpet . But they do not pay any attention to the warning . The enemies come and kill them . Then what happens to them will be their own fault .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	5	They heard the sound of the trumpet . But they did not pay any attention to the warning . So what happened to them was their own fault . If they had paid attention , they would have saved themselves .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	6	But suppose the guard sees the enemies coming . And he does not blow the trumpet to warn the people . The enemies come and kill one of them . Then their life has been taken away from them because they sinned . But I will hold the guard responsible for their death. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	7	“ Son of man , I have appointed you as a prophet to warn the people of Israel . So listen to my message . Give them a warning from me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	8	Suppose I say to a sinful person , ‘ You can be sure that you will die. ’ And suppose you do not try to get them to change their ways . Then they will die because they have sinned . And I will hold you responsible for their death .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	9	But suppose you do warn that sinful person . You tell them to change their ways . But they do not change . Then they will die because they have sinned . But you will have saved yourself .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	10	“ Son of man , speak to the Israelites . Tell them , ‘ You are saying , “ Our sins and the wrong things we have done weigh us down . We are wasting away because we have sinned so much . So how can we live ? ” ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	11	Tell them , ‘ When sinful people die , it does not give me any joy . But when they turn away from their sins and live , that makes me very happy . And that is just as sure as I am alive , ’ announces the Lord and King . ‘ So turn away from your sins ! Change your evil ways ! Why should you die , people of Israel ? ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	12	“ Son of man , speak to your people . Tell them , ‘ Suppose a godly person does not obey the Lord . Then the right things that person has done in the past count for nothing . Suppose a sinful person turns away from doing wrong things . Then the wrong things that person has done in the past won ’ t bring them judgment . A godly person who sins won ’ t be allowed to live . That ’ s true even though they used to do right things. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	13	Suppose I tell a godly person that they will live . And they trust in the fact that they used to do what is right . But now they do what is evil . Then I will not remember any of the right things they have done . They will die because they have done so many evil things .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	14	Suppose I say to a sinful person , ‘ You can be sure you will die. ’ And then they turn away from their sin . They do what is fair and right .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	15	They return things they take to make sure loans are repaid . They give back what they have stolen . They obey my rules that give life . They do not do what is evil . Then you can be sure they will live . They will not die .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	16	None of the sins they have committed will be held against them . They have done what is fair and right . So you can be sure they will live .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	17	“ In spite of that , your people say , ‘ What the Lord does isn ’ t fair. ’ But it is what you do that is not fair .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	18	Suppose a godly person stops doing what is right . And they do what is evil . Then they will die because of it .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	19	But suppose a sinful person turns away from the evil things they have done . And they do what is fair and right . Then they will live by doing that .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	20	In spite of that , you Israelites say , ‘ What the Lord does isn ’ t fair. ’ But I will judge each of you based on how you have lived. ” The Lord Explains Why Jerusalem Fell
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	21	It was the 12th year since we had been brought to Babylon as prisoners . On the fifth day of the tenth month , a man who had escaped from Jerusalem came to bring me a report . He said , “ The city has fallen ! ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	22	The evening before the man arrived , the power of the Lord came on me . He opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning . So my mouth was opened . I was no longer silent .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	23	Then a message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	24	“ Son of man , here is what the people living in Israel ’ s broken-down buildings are saying . ‘ Abraham was only one man . But he owned the land . We are many people . The land must certainly belong to us. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	25	So tell them , ‘ The Lord and King says , “ You eat meat that still has blood in it . You worship your statues of gods . You commit murder . So should you still possess the land ?
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	26	You depend on your swords . You do things I hate . Each one of you sleeps with your neighbor ’ s wife . So should you still possess the land ? ” ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	27	“ Tell them , ‘ Here is what the Lord and King says . “ The people who are left in those broken-down buildings will be killed by swords . Wild animals will eat up those who are out in the country . Those who are in caves and other safe places will die of a plague . And that is just as sure as I am alive .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	28	I will turn the land into a dry and empty desert . The strength Jerusalem is so proud of will come to an end . The mountains of Israel will be deserted . No one will travel across them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	29	So I will turn the land into a dry and empty desert . I will punish my people because of all the evil things they have done . I hate those things . Then they will know that I am the Lord. ” ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	30	“ Son of man , your people are talking about you . They are getting together by the walls of their houses and at their doors . They are saying to one another , ‘ Come . Listen to the Lord ’ s message. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	31	My people come to you , just as they usually do . They sit in front of you . They hear what you say . But they do not put it into practice . With their mouths they say they love me . But in their hearts they want what belongs to others . They try to get rich by cheating them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	33	32	You are nothing more to them than someone who sings love songs . They say you have a beautiful voice . They think you play an instrument well . They hear what you say . But they do not put it into practice .

NIRV	Ezekiel	34	34	A message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	2	“ Son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of Israel . Tell them , ‘ The Lord and King says , “ How terrible it will be for you shepherds of Israel ! You only take care of yourselves . You should take good care of your flocks .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	3	Instead , you eat the butter . You dress yourselves with the wool . You kill the finest animals . But you do not take care of your flocks .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	4	You have not made the weak ones in the flock stronger . You have not healed the sick . You have not bandaged those who are hurt . You have not brought back those who have wandered away . You have not searched for the lost . When you ruled over them , you were mean to them . You treated them badly .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	5	So they were scattered because they did not have a shepherd . They became food for all of the wild animals .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	6	My sheep wandered all over the mountains and high hills . They were scattered over the whole earth . No one searched for them . No one looked for them. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	7	“ ‘ Shepherds , listen to the Lord ’ s message . He says ,
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	8	“ My flock does not have a shepherd . Many of my sheep have been stolen . They have become food for all the wild animals . My shepherds did not care for my sheep . They did not even search for them . Instead , they only took care of themselves . And that is just as sure as I am alive , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	9	Shepherds , listen to the Lord ’ s message .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	10	The Lord and King says , “ I am against the shepherds . I will hold them responsible for my flock . I will stop them from taking care of the flock . Then they will not be able to feed themselves anymore . I will save my flock from their mouths . My sheep will no longer be food for them. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	11	The Lord and King says , “ I myself will search for my sheep . I will look after them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	12	A shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them . And I will look after my sheep . I will save them from all the places where they were scattered on a dark and cloudy day .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	13	I will bring them out from among the nations . I will gather them together from other countries . I will bring them into their own land . There they will eat grass on the mountains and in the valleys . And they will eat in all the fields of Israel .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	14	I will take care of them in the best grasslands . They will eat grass on the highest mountains of Israel . There they will lie down in the finest grasslands . They will eat grass in the best places on Israel ’ s mountains .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	15	I myself will take care of my sheep . I will let them lie down in safety , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	16	“ I will search for the lost . I will bring back those who have wandered away . I will bandage the ones who are hurt . I will make the weak ones stronger . But I will destroy those who are fat and strong . I will take good care of my sheep . I will treat them fairly. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	17	The Lord and King says , “ You are my flock . I will judge between one sheep and another . I will judge between rams and goats .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	18	You already eat in the best grasslands . Must you also stomp all over the other fields ? You already drink clear water . Must you also make the rest of the water muddy with your feet ?
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	19	Must my flock have to eat the grass you have stomped on ? Must they drink the water you have made muddy ? ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	20	So the Lord and King speaks to them . He says , “ I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the skinny sheep .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	21	You push the other sheep around with your hips and shoulders . You use your horns to butt all the weak sheep . Finally , you drive them away .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	22	But I will save my sheep . They will not be carried off anymore . I will judge between one sheep and another .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	23	I will place one shepherd over them . He will belong to the family line of my servant David . He will take good care of them . He will look after them . He will be their shepherd .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	24	I am the Lord . I will be their God . And my servant from David ’ s family line will be the prince among them . I have spoken . I am the Lord .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	25	“ I will make a covenant with them . It promises to give them peace . I will get rid of the wild animals in the land . Then my sheep can live safely in the desert . They can sleep in the forests .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	26	I will make them and the places surrounding my holy mountain of Zion a blessing . I will send down rain at the right time . There will be showers of blessing .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	27	The trees will bear their fruit . And the ground will produce its crops . The people will be secure in their land . I will break the chains that hold them . I will save them from the power of those who made them slaves . Then they will know that I am the Lord .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	28	The nations will not carry them off anymore . Wild animals will no longer eat them up . They will live in safety . And no one will make them afraid .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	29	I will give them a land that is famous for its crops . They will never again be hungry there . The nations will not make fun of them anymore .
NIRV	Ezekiel	34	30	Then they will know that I am with them . I am the Lord their God . And the Israelites will know that they are my people , ” announces the Lord and King .

NIRV	Ezekiel	35	35	A message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Ezekiel	35	2	“ Son of man , turn your attention to Mount Seir . Prophesy against it .
NIRV	Ezekiel	35	3	Tell it , ‘ The Lord and King says , “ Mount Seir , I am against you . I will reach out my powerful hand against you . I will turn you into a dry and empty desert .
NIRV	Ezekiel	35	4	I will destroy your towns . Your land will become empty . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
NIRV	Ezekiel	35	5	“ ‘ “ People of Edom , you have been Israel ’ s enemies for a long time . You let many Israelites be killed by swords when they were in great trouble . At that time I used Nebuchadnezzar to punish them and destroy them completely .
NIRV	Ezekiel	35	6	Now I will hand you over to murderers . They will hunt you down . You murdered others . So murderers will chase you . And that is just as sure as I am alive , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	35	7	“ I will turn Mount Seir into a dry and empty desert . No one will be able to go anywhere or do anything there .
NIRV	Ezekiel	35	8	I will fill your mountains with dead bodies . Some of those who are killed by swords will fall down dead on your hills . Others will die in your valleys and in all your canyons .
NIRV	Ezekiel	35	9	I will make your land empty forever . No one will live in your towns . Then you will know that I am the Lord .
NIRV	Ezekiel	35	10	“ ‘ “ You said , ‘ The nations of Israel and Judah will belong to us . We will take them over. ’ You said that , even though I was there . I am the Lord .
NIRV	Ezekiel	35	11	You were full of anger , jealousy and hatred toward my people . So I will punish you . When I judge you , they will know that I am the Lord . And that is just as sure as I am alive , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	35	12	“ You will know that I have heard all the terrible things you said . You said them about those who live in the mountains of Israel . You made fun of them . You said , ‘ They have been destroyed . They ’ ve been handed over to us . Let ’ s wipe them out. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	35	13	You bragged that you were better than I am . You spoke against me . You did not hold anything back . But I heard it. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	35	14	The Lord and King says , “ The whole earth will be glad . But I will make your land empty .
NIRV	Ezekiel	35	15	You were happy when the land of Israel became empty . So I will treat you in the same way . Mount Seir , you will be empty . So will the whole land of Edom . Then you will know that I am the Lord. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	36	36	Then the nations that remain around you will know that I have rebuilt what was once destroyed . I have planted again the fields that were once empty . I have spoken . And I will do this . I am the Lord. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	2	The Lord and King says , “ Your enemies made fun of you . They bragged , ‘ The hills you lived in for a long time belong to us now. ’ ” ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	3	Ezekiel , prophesy . Say , ‘ The Lord and King says , “ Your enemies destroyed you . They crushed you from every side . So the rest of the nations took over your land . People talked about you . They told lies about you. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	4	Mountains of Israel , listen to the message of the Lord and King . He speaks to you mountains , hills , canyons and valleys . He speaks to you destroyed cities and deserted towns . The rest of the nations around you took away from you everything of value . They made fun of you .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	5	So the Lord and King says , “ I am very angry with those nations . I have spoken against them and the whole land of Edom . They were very happy when they took over my land . Deep down inside them , they hated Israel . They wanted to take its grasslands .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	6	Ezekiel , prophesy about the land of Israel . Speak to the mountains , hills , canyons and valleys . Tell them , ‘ The Lord and King says , “ I have a jealous anger against the nations . They have laughed at you. ”

NIRV	Ezekiel	36	8	“ ‘ “ Mountains of Israel , you will produce branches and bear fruit for my people Israel . They will come home soon .

NIRV	Ezekiel	36	13	The Lord and King says , “ People say to you mountains , ‘ You destroy people . You let your nation ’ s children be taken away. ’

NIRV	Ezekiel	36	16	Another message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	17	“ Son of man , the people of Israel used to live in their own land . But they made it ‘ unclean ’ because of how they acted and the way they lived . To me they were ‘ unclean ’ like a woman having her monthly period .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	18	They spilled people ’ s blood in the land . They made the land ‘ unclean ’ by worshiping other gods . So I poured out my great anger on them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	19	I scattered them among the nations . I sent them to other countries . I judged them based on how they acted and on how they lived .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	20	They treated my name as if it were not holy . They did it everywhere they went among the nations . People said about them , ‘ They are the Lord ’ s people . But they were forced to leave his land. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	21	I was concerned about my holy name . The people of Israel treated it as if it were not holy . They did it everywhere they went among the nations .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	22	“ So tell the Israelites , ‘ The Lord and King speaks . He says , “ People of Israel , I will not take action for your benefit . Instead , I will act for the honor of my holy name . You have treated it as if it were not holy . You did it everywhere you went among the nations .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	23	But I will show everyone how holy my great name is . You have treated it as if it were not holy . So I will use you to prove to the nations how holy I am . Then they will know that I am the Lord , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	24	“ ‘ “ I will take you out of the nations . I will gather you together from all the countries . I will bring you back into your own land .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	25	I will sprinkle pure water on you . Then you will be ‘ clean. ’ I will make you completely pure and ‘ clean. ’ I will take all the statues of your gods away from you .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	26	I will give you new hearts . I will give you a new spirit that is faithful to me . I will remove your stubborn hearts from you . I will give you hearts that obey me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	27	I will put my Spirit in you . I will make you want to obey my rules . I want you to be careful to keep my laws .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	28	Then you will live in the land I gave your people of long ago . You will be my people . And I will be your God .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	29	I will save you from all your ‘ uncleanness. ’ I will give you plenty of grain . You will have more than enough . So you will never be hungry again .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	30	I will multiply the fruit on your trees . I will increase the crops in your fields . Then the nations will no longer make fun of you because you are hungry .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	31	You will remember your evil ways and the sinful things you have done . You will hate yourselves because you have sinned so much . I also hate your evil practices .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	32	I want you to know that I am not doing those things for your benefit , ” announces the Lord and King . “ People of Israel , you should be ashamed of yourselves ! Your conduct has brought dishonor to you. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	33	The Lord and King says , “ I will make you pure from all your sins . On that day I will give you homes in your towns again . Your broken-down houses will be rebuilt .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	34	The dry and empty land will be farmed again . Everyone who passes through it will see that it is no longer empty .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	35	They will say , ‘ This land was completely destroyed . But now it ’ s like the Garden of Eden . The cities were full of broken-down buildings . They were destroyed and empty . But now they have high walls around them . And people live in them. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	37	The Lord and King says , “ Once again I will answer Israel ’ s prayer . Here is what I will do for them . I will multiply them as if they were sheep .
NIRV	Ezekiel	36	38	Large flocks of animals are sacrificed at Jerusalem during the appointed feasts there . In the same way , the destroyed cities will be filled with flocks of people . Then they will know that I am the Lord. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	37	37	The power of the Lord came on me . His Spirit brought me away from my home . He put me down in the middle of a valley . It was full of bones .
NIRV	Ezekiel	37	2	He led me back and forth among them . I saw a huge number of bones in the valley . The bones were very dry .
NIRV	Ezekiel	37	3	The Lord asked me , “ Son of man , can these bones live ? ” I said , “ Lord and King , you are the only one who knows. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	37	4	Then he said to me , “ Prophesy to these bones . Tell them , ‘ Dry bones , listen to the Lord ’ s message .

NIRV	Ezekiel	37	7	So I prophesied just as the Lord commanded me to . As I was prophesying , I heard a noise . It was a rattling sound . The bones came together . One bone connected itself to another .
NIRV	Ezekiel	37	8	I saw tendons and flesh appear on them . Skin covered them . But there was no breath in them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	37	9	Then the Lord said to me , “ Prophesy to the breath . Prophesy , son of man . Tell it , ‘ The Lord and King says , “ Breath , come from all four directions . Go into these people who have been killed . Then they can live. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	37	10	So I prophesied just as he commanded me to . And breath entered them . Then they came to life again . They stood up on their feet . They were like a huge army .
NIRV	Ezekiel	37	11	Then the Lord said to me , “ Son of man , these bones stand for all the people of Israel . The people say , ‘ Our bones are dried up . We ’ ve lost all hope . We are destroyed. ’

NIRV	Ezekiel	41	11	The side rooms had entrances from the open area . One was on the north side . Another was on the south . The base next to the open area was almost nine feet wide all around .
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	2	The entrance was
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	18	Carved cherubim and palm trees were used in the decorations . Each cherub had a palm tree next to it . And each palm tree had a cherub next to it . Each cherub had two faces .
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	70	feet long and
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	35	feet wide . It went all around the temple .
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	3	Then he went into the Most Holy Room . There he measured the doorposts at the entrance . Each one of them was three and a half feet wide . The entrance itself was
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	12	There was a large building right behind the temple . It was on the west side of the outer courtyard . It was
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	4	He also measured the Most Holy Room . It was
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	5	Then the man measured the wall of the temple . It was
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	6	The side rooms were on three floors . There were
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	30	rooms on each floor . Ledges had been built all around the wall of the temple . So the floor beams of the side rooms rested on the ledges . The beams didn ’ t go into the temple wall .
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	7	The side rooms of the temple were wider as we went up floor by floor . A stairway went from the lowest floor all the way up to the top floor . It passed through the middle floor .
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	8	I saw that the temple had a raised base all around it . The base formed the foundation of the side rooms . It was as long as one measuring rod . So it was
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	9	The outer wall of each side room was almost nine feet thick . The open area between the side rooms of the temple
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	10	and the priests ’ rooms was
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	123	feet wide . Its wall was almost nine feet thick all around . And it was
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	158	feet long .
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	13	Then the man measured the temple . It was
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	175	feet long . That included the walkways of the building on each side . The main hall and the Most Holy Room were covered with wood .
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	14	The east side of the inner courtyard was
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	15	Then the man measured the building that was on the west side of the outer courtyard . It was behind the temple . It was
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	16	And the porch that faced the inner courtyard was covered with wood . So were the gateways , narrow openings and walkways around these three places . The gateways and everything beyond them were covered with wood . The floor , the wall up to the openings , and the openings themselves were also covered .
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	17	The area above the outside of the entrance to the Most Holy Room was decorated . There were also decorations all around the walls of the Most Holy Room .
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	19	One was the face of a human being . It looked toward the palm tree on one side . The other was the face of a lion . It looked toward the palm tree on the other side . The decorations were carved all around the whole temple .
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	20	Cherubim and palm trees decorated the wall of the main hall . They were carved from the floor all the way up to the area above the entrance .
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	21	The main hall had a doorframe shaped like a rectangle . So did the Most Holy Room .
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	22	A wooden altar stood in the main hall . It was a little over five feet high . It was three and a half feet long and three and a half feet wide . Its corners , base and sides were made out of wood . The man said to me , “ This is the table that stands in front of the Lord. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	23	The main hall had double doors . So did the Most Holy Room .
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	24	Each door had two parts that could swing back and forth .
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	25	Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the doors of the main hall . The decorations were like the ones on the walls . A wooden roof went out beyond the front of the porch .
NIRV	Ezekiel	41	26	The side walls of the porch had narrow openings on top of them . Palm trees were carved on each side . A wooden roof went out beyond the entrance to each side room of the temple . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	42	42	Then the man led me north into the outer courtyard of the temple . He brought me to the rooms that were across from the inner courtyard . They were across from the outer wall of the temple on the north side .
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	2	The rooms were in a building north of the temple . The building had a door that faced north . It was
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	175	feet long .
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	88	feet long . The one closest to the temple was
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	3	One row of rooms was next to the inner courtyard . The other row was across from the sidewalk of the outer courtyard . Each room was
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	35	feet long . Walkways in front of each row faced each other on all three floors .
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	4	Between the two rows was an inner sidewalk . It was
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	18	He measured the south side . It was
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	5	The rooms on the top floor were narrower than the others . The walkways took up more space from these rooms . The walkways took up less space from the rooms on the other two floors .
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	6	The courtyards had pillars . But the rooms on the top floor didn ’ t . So their floor space was smaller than the space in the rooms on the other floors .
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	7	The building had an outer wall . It was even with the outer row of rooms and with the outer courtyard . The wall continued east of the outer row for
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	8	So there were two rows of rooms . The row next to the outer courtyard was
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	9	The first floor of the building had an entrance on the east side . It led to the outer courtyard .
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	10	There were also two rows of rooms in a building next to the south side of the inner courtyard . The building was across from the south wall of the outer courtyard .
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	11	Between the two rows was an inner sidewalk . The rooms were like the ones in the north building . They were as long and wide as the rooms on the north . The doorways of the rooms on the south were like the ones on the north .
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	12	People entered the south rooms through the doorway at the east end of the inner sidewalk . The south wall continued east of the outer row of rooms .
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	13	The man said to me , “ The north and south rooms face the inner courtyard . They are the priests ’ rooms . That is where the priests who approach the Lord will eat the very holy offerings . They will also store them there . That includes the grain offerings , sin offerings and guilt offerings . This place is holy .
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	14	The priests who enter these holy rooms must leave behind the clothes they served in . Then they can go into the outer courtyard . The clothes they served in are holy . So the priests must put other clothes on . They have to do that before they go near the places where other people go. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	15	The man finished measuring what was inside the temple area . Then he led me out through the east gate . He measured all around the area .
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	16	He measured the east side with his measuring rod . It was
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	875	feet wide . It separated what was holy from what was not . Copyright ©
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	17	He measured the north side . It was
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	19	Finally , he turned and measured the west side . It was
NIRV	Ezekiel	42	20	So he measured the area on all four sides . It had a wall around it . The wall was

NIRV	Ezekiel	43	43	Then the man brought me to the east gate .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	2	There I saw the glory of the God of Israel . He was coming from the east . His voice was like the roar of rushing waters . His glory made the land shine brightly .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	3	The vision I saw was like the one I had when he came to destroy the city . It was also like the visions I had seen by the Kebar River . I fell with my face toward the ground .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	4	The glory of the Lord entered the temple through the east gate .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	5	Then the Spirit lifted me up . He brought me into the inner courtyard . The glory of the Lord filled the temple .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	6	The man was standing beside me . I heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	7	He said , “ Son of man , this is the place where my throne is . The stool for my feet is also here . I will live here among the people of Israel forever . They will never again treat my name as if it were not holy . They and their kings will not serve other gods anymore . The people will no longer make funeral offerings for their kings .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	8	The people of Israel placed their own doorway next to my holy doorway . They put their doorposts right beside mine . Nothing but a thin wall separated us . They treated my name as if it were not holy . I hated it when they did that . So I became angry with them and destroyed them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	9	Now let them stop serving other gods . Let them stop making funeral offerings for their kings . If they obey me , I will live among them forever .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	10	“ Son of man , tell the people of Israel about the temple . Then they will be ashamed of their sins . Let them think carefully about how perfect it is .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	11	inches wide . The steps leading up to the top of the altar face east. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	12	“ Here is the law of the temple . The whole area on top of Mount Zion will be very holy . That is the law of the temple. ” The Great Altar Is Rebuilt
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	13	The man said , “ Here is the size of the altar . The standard measurement I am using is
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	21	Use the bull for the sin offering . Burn it in the proper place outside the temple .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	14	From the drain to the lower ledge is three and a half feet . The lower ledge goes around the altar and is
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	15	The top part of the altar is where the sacrifices are burned . It is seven feet high . A horn sticks out from each of its four corners .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	16	The top part of the altar is square . It is
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	17	The upper ledge is also square . It is
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	25	“ ‘ Provide a male goat each day for seven days . It is a sin offering . Also provide a young bull and a ram from the flock . They must not have any flaws .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	18	Then the man said to me , “ Son of man , the Lord and King speaks . He says , ‘ Here are the rules for the altar when it is built . Follow them when you sacrifice burnt offerings and splash blood against it .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	19	Give a young bull to the priests as a sin offering . They are Levites from the family of Zadok . They approach me to serve me , ’ announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	20	‘ Get some of the bull ’ s blood . Put it on the four horns of the altar . Also put it on the four corners of the upper ledge of the altar and all around the rim . That will make the altar pure and “ clean. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	22	“ ‘ On the second day offer a male goat . It must not have any flaws . It is a sin offering to make the altar pure and “ clean. ” So do the same thing with the goat that you did with the bull .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	23	When you finish making the altar pure , offer a young bull and a ram from the flock . They must not have any flaws .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	24	Offer them to me . The priests must sprinkle salt on them . Then they must sacrifice them as a burnt offering to me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	26	For seven days the priests must make the altar pure and “ clean. ” That is how they will set it apart to me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	43	27	From the eighth day on , the priests must bring your burnt offerings and friendship offerings . They must sacrifice them on the altar . Then I will accept you , ’ announces the Lord and King. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	44	44	Then the man brought me back to the outer gate of the temple . It was the one that faced east . It was shut .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	2	The Lord said to me , “ This gate must remain shut . It must not be opened . No one can enter through it . It must remain shut because I have entered through it . I am the God of Israel .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	3	The prince is the only one who can sit in the gateway . There he can eat in front of me . He must enter through the porch of the gateway . And he must go out the same way. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	4	Then the man brought me through the north gate . He took me to the front of the temple . I looked up and saw the glory of the Lord . It filled his temple . I fell with my face toward the ground .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	5	The Lord said to me , “ Son of man , pay attention . Look carefully . Listen closely to everything I tell you . I ’ m telling you about all the rules and instructions concerning my temple . Pay attention to the entrance to the temple and to all its exits .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	6	Speak to the people of Israel . They refuse to obey me . Tell them , ‘ Here is what the Lord and King says . “ People of Israel , I have had enough of your evil practices . I hate them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	7	You brought outsiders into my temple . They were not circumcised . Their hearts were stubborn . You made my temple ‘ unclean. ’ But you offered me food , fat and blood anyway . When you did all these things , you broke the covenant I made with you . I hated all the evil things you did .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	8	You did not do what I told you to . You did not take care of my holy things . Instead , you put other people in charge of my temple. ” ’ ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	9	The Lord and King says , “ No outsider whose heart is stubborn can enter my temple . They have not been circumcised . Even if they live among the people of Israel they can ’ t enter my temple .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	10	“ Some Levites wandered far away from me when Israel went astray . They worshiped the statues of their gods . So they will be punished because they have sinned .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	11	They might serve in my temple . They might be in charge of its gates . They might kill the burnt offerings and sacrifices for the people . And they might stand in front of the people and serve them in other ways .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	12	But these Levites served the people of Israel . They served while the Israelites were worshiping the statues of their gods . They made the people fall into sin . So I raised my hand and made a promise . I warned them that I would punish them because of their sin , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	13	“ They must not approach me to serve me as priests . They must not come near any of my holy things . They must stay away from my very holy offerings . They did many things they should have been ashamed of . I hated those things .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	14	But I will still appoint them to guard the temple . They will guard it for all the work that has to be done there .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	15	“ But the priests must approach me to serve me . They are Levites from Zadok ’ s family line . They guarded my temple when the people of Israel turned away from me . These priests must serve me by offering sacrifices of fat and blood , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	16	“ They are the only ones who can enter my temple . Only they can come near to serve me as guards .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	17	“ They will enter the gates of the inner courtyard . When they do , they must wear linen clothes . They will serve at the gates of the inner courtyard or inside the temple . When they do , they must not wear any clothes made out of wool .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	18	They must have linen turbans on their heads . They must wear linen underwear around their waists . They must not wear anything that makes them sweat .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	19	They will go into the outer courtyard where the people are . When they do , they must take off the clothes they have been serving in . They must leave them in the sacred rooms . And they must put other clothes on . Then the people will not be made holy if they happen to touch the priests ’ clothes .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	20	“ The priests must not shave their heads . They must not let their hair grow long . They must keep it cut short .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	21	No priest may drink wine when he enters the inner courtyard .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	22	They must not get married to widows or divorced women . They may only marry Israelite virgins or the widows of priests .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	23	The priests must teach my people the difference between what is holy and what is not . They must show them how to tell the difference between what is ‘ clean ’ and what is not .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	24	“ When people do not agree , the priests must serve as judges between them . They must make their decisions based on my laws . They must obey my laws and rules for all my appointed feasts . And they must keep my Sabbath days holy .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	25	“ A priest must not make himself ‘ unclean ’ by going near a dead person . But suppose the dead person was his father or mother . Or suppose it was his son or daughter or brother or unmarried sister . Then the priest may make himself ‘ unclean. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	26	After he is pure and ‘ clean ’ again , he must wait seven days .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	27	Then he may go to the inner courtyard to serve in the temple . But when he does , he must sacrifice a sin offering for himself , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	28	“ The priests will not receive any part of the land of Israel . I myself will be their only share .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	29	They will eat the grain offerings , sin offerings and guilt offerings . Everything in Israel that is set apart to me in a special way will belong to them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	44	30	The best of every first share of the people ’ s crops will belong to the priests . So will all their special gifts . The people must give the priests the first share of their ground meal . Then I will bless my people ’ s families .

NIRV	Ezekiel	45	45	“ People of Israel , you will divide up the land you will receive . When you do , give me my share of it . It will be a sacred area . It will be eight miles long and six and a half miles wide . The entire area will be holy .
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	2	The temple area in it will be
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	875	feet wide . An 88-foot strip around it will be open land .
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	3	In the sacred area , measure off a large strip of land . It will be eight miles long and three and a third miles wide . The temple will be in it . It will be the most holy place of all .
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	4	The large strip will be the sacred share of land for the priests . There they will serve in the temple . And they will approach me to serve me there . Their houses will be built on that land . The holy temple will also be located there .
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	5	So the Levites will serve in the temple . They will have an area eight miles long and three and a third miles wide . The towns they live in will be located there .
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	6	“ Give the city an area one and two-thirds miles wide and eight miles long . It will be right next to the sacred area . It will belong to all the people of Israel .

NIRV	Ezekiel	45	8	The prince will own this land in Israel . And my princes will not crush my people anymore . Instead , they will allow the people of Israel to receive their own share of land . It will be divided up based on their tribes. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	9	The Lord and King says , “ Princes of Israel , you have gone far enough ! Stop hurting others . Do not crush them . Do what is fair and right . Stop taking my people ’ s land away from them , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	10	“ Use weights and measures that are honest and exact .
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	11	Use the same standard to measure dry and liquid products . Use a 6-bushel measure for dry products . And use a 60-gallon measure for liquids .
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	12	Every amount of money must be weighed out in keeping with the standard weights .
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	13	“ You must offer a special gift . It must be six pounds out of every six bushels of grain .
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	14	Give two and a half quarts out of every

NIRV	Ezekiel	45	15	Also give one sheep from every flock of
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	200	sheep . Get them from the grasslands of Israel that receive plenty of water . Use them for grain offerings , burnt offerings and friendship offerings . They will be used to pay for the sin of the people , ” announces the Lord and King .
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	16	“ All the people in the land will be required to give this special gift . They must give it to the prince in Israel .
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	17	He must provide the burnt offerings , grain offerings and drink offerings . They will be for the yearly feasts , New Moon feasts and Sabbath days . So they will be for all the appointed feasts of the people of Israel . The prince will provide the sin offerings , grain offerings , burnt offerings and friendship offerings . They will be used to pay for the sin of the Israelites. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	18	The Lord and King says , “ Get a young bull . It must not have any flaws . Use it to make the temple pure and ‘ clean. ’ Do this on the first day of the first month .
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	19	The priest must get some of the blood from the sin offering . He must put some on the doorposts of the temple . He must apply some to the four corners of the upper ledge of the altar . He must put the rest on the gateposts of the inner courtyard .
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	20	Do the same thing on the seventh day of the month . Do this for those who sin without meaning to . And do this for those who sin without realizing what they are doing . So you will make the temple pure and ‘ clean. ’
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	21	“ Keep the Passover Feast on the 14th day of the first month . It will last for seven days . During that time you must eat bread made without yeast .
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	22	The prince must provide a bull as a sin offering . It will be for him and all the people of the land .
NIRV	Ezekiel	45	23	For each of the seven days of the feast he must provide seven bulls and seven rams . They must not have any flaws . They will be a burnt offering to me . The prince must also provide a male goat for a sin offering .

NIRV	Ezekiel	46	46	The Lord and King says , “ On the six working days of each week you must keep the east gate of the inner courtyard of the temple shut . But open it on Sabbath days and during New Moon feasts .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	2	The prince must enter the temple area through the porch of the gateway . He must stand by the gatepost . The priests must sacrifice his burnt offering and friendship offerings . He must bow down in worship at the entrance of the gateway . Then he must leave . But the gate will not be shut until evening .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	3	On Sabbath days and during New Moon feasts the people of the land must gather together . They must gather at the entrance of the temple gateway . That is where they must worship me .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	4	The prince must bring a burnt offering to me on the Sabbath day . It will be six male lambs and a ram . They must not have any flaws .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	5	He must offer
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	35	pounds of grain .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	6	On the day of the New Moon feast the prince must make another offering . He must offer a young bull , six lambs and a ram . They must not have any flaws .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	7	He must offer
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	8	Here is how the prince must enter the temple area . He must go in through the porch of the gateway . And he must leave the same way .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	9	“ The people of the land must worship me at the appointed feasts . Those who enter through the north gate must leave through the south gate . Those who enter through the south gate must leave through the north gate . They must not leave through the same gate they entered . Each one must go out the opposite gate .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	10	The prince must be among them . He must go in when they go in . And he must leave when they leave .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	11	At the yearly feasts and other appointed feasts there must be grain offerings . The prince must offer
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	12	“ He may also bring another offering to me because he chooses to . It might be a burnt offering or friendship offering . When he brings it , the east gate must be opened for him . He will bring his offering just as he does on the Sabbath day . Then he will leave . After he has gone out , the gate must be shut .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	13	“ Every day you must provide a lamb that is a year old . It must not have any flaws . It is a burnt offering to me . You must provide it every morning .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	14	You must also offer grain along with it every morning . Bring six pounds of grain . Also bring one and a half quarts of olive oil to make the flour a little wet . So you will give the grain offering to me . That will be a law that will last for all time to come .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	15	Provide the lamb , grain offering and oil every morning . They will be used for a regular burnt offering. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	16	The Lord and King says , “ Suppose the prince makes a gift from his share of land . And he gives it to one of his sons . Then the property will also belong to his sons after him . It will be handed down to them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	17	But suppose he makes a gift from his share of land to one of his servants . Then the servant may keep it until the Year of Jubilee . After that , it will be returned to the prince . His property may be handed down only to his sons . It belongs to them .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	18	The prince must not take any share of land that belongs to the people . He must not drive them off their property . He must give his sons their share out of his own property . Then not one of my people will be separated from their property. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	19	The man brought me through the entrance at the side of the north building . That ’ s where the priests ’ sacred rooms were located . He showed me a place west of the building .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	20	He said to me , “ This is where the priests must cook the guilt offerings and sin offerings . They must also bake the grain offerings here . Then they will not have to bring the offerings into the outer courtyard . That will keep the people from touching the offerings and becoming holy. ”
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	21	Then the man brought me to the outer courtyard . He led me around to its four corners . In each corner I saw another smaller courtyard .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	22	So in the four corners of the outer courtyard were walled courtyards . Each one was
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	70	feet long and
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	53	feet wide . All of them were the same size .
NIRV	Ezekiel	46	23	Around the inside of each of the four courtyards was a stone ledge . Places for fire were built all around under each ledge .

NIRV	Ezekiel	47	47	The man brought me back to the entrance to the temple . I saw water flowing east from under a temple gateway . The temple faced east . The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple . It was flowing south of the altar .
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	2	Then he brought me out through the north gate of the outer courtyard . He led me around the outside to the outer gate that faced east . The water was flowing from the south side of the east gate .
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	3	Then the man went toward the east . He had a measuring line in his hand . He measured off 1,700 feet . He led me through water that was up to my ankles .
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	4	Then he measured off another 1,700 feet . He led me through water that was up to my knees . Then he measured off another 1,700 feet . He led me through water that was up to my waist .
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	5	Then he measured off another 1,700 feet . But now it was a river that I could not go across . The water had risen so high that it was deep enough to swim in .
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	6	He asked me , “ Son of man , do you see this ? ” Then he led me back to the bank of the river .
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	7	When I arrived there , I saw many trees . They were on both sides of the river .
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	8	The man said to me , “ This water flows toward the eastern territory . It goes down into the Arabah Valley . There it enters the Dead Sea . When it empties into it , the salt water there becomes fresh .
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	9	Many creatures will live where the river flows . It will have many schools of fish . This water flows there and makes the salt water fresh . So where the river flows everything will live .
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	10	People will stand along the shore to fish . From En Gedi all the way to En Eglaim there will be places for spreading fishnets . The Dead Sea will have many kinds of fish . They will be like the fish in the Mediterranean Sea .
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	11	But none of the swamps will have fresh water in them . They will stay salty .
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	12	tribes of Israel . Each tribe will receive a share . But the family of Joseph will have two shares .
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	13	Here is what the Lord and King says . “ People of Israel , here are the borders of the land that you will divide up . You will divide up the land among the
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	14	Divide the land into equal parts . Long ago I raised my hand and made a promise . I promised to give the land to your people of long ago . So all of it will belong to you .

NIRV	Ezekiel	47	19	“ On the south side the border will start at Tamar . It will reach all the way to the waters of Meribah Kadesh . Then it will run along the Wadi of Egypt . It will end at the Mediterranean Sea . This will be the southern border .
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	20	“ On the west side , the Mediterranean Sea will be the border . It will go to a point across from Lebo Hamath . This will be the western border .
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	21	“ You must divide up this land among yourselves . Do this based on the number of men in your tribes .
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	22	Each of the tribes must receive a share of the land . You must also give some land to the outsiders who live among you and who have children . Treat them as if they had been born in Israel . Let them have some land among your tribes .
NIRV	Ezekiel	47	23	Outsiders can live in the land of any tribe . There you must give them their share , ” announces the Lord and King . Copyright ©

NIRV	Ezekiel	48	15	“ The area that remains is one and two-thirds miles wide . It is eight miles long . It will not be holy . The people in Jerusalem can build houses there . They can use some of it as grasslands . The city will be in the center of it .

NIRV	Ezekiel	48	20	The entire area will be a square . Each of its four sides will be eight miles long . Set the sacred share apart as a special gift to me . Do the same thing with the property of the city .
NIRV	Ezekiel	48	21	“ The area that remains on both sides will belong to the prince . So his land does not include the sacred share and the property of the city . The eastern part of his land will reach from the sacred share all the way to the eastern border . The western part will reach from the sacred share to the western border . The sacred share itself is eight miles long on its east and west sides . Both of those areas will be right next to the borders of the two tribes on the north and south sides . They will belong to the prince . The sacred share will be in the center of them . It will have the temple in it .

NIRV	Daniel	1	1	It was the third year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah . Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , came to Jerusalem . His armies surrounded the city and attacked it .
NIRV	Daniel	1	2	The Lord handed Jehoiakim , the king of Judah , over to him . Nebuchadnezzar also took some of the objects from God ’ s temple . He carried them off to the temple of his god in Babylon . He put them among the treasures of his god .
NIRV	Daniel	1	3	The king gave Ashpenaz an order . Ashpenaz was the chief of Nebuchadnezzar ’ s court officials . The king told him to bring him some of the Israelites . The king wanted them to serve him in his court . He wanted nobles and men from the royal family .
NIRV	Daniel	1	4	He was looking for young men who were healthy and handsome . They had to be able to learn anything . They had to be well educated . They had to have the ability to understand new things quickly and easily . The king wanted men who could serve in his palace . Ashpenaz was supposed to teach them the Babylonian language and writings .
NIRV	Daniel	1	5	The king had his servants give them food and wine from his own table . They received a certain amount every day . The young men had to be trained for three years . After that , they could begin to serve the king .
NIRV	Daniel	1	6	Some of the men chosen were from Judah . Their names were Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael and Azariah .
NIRV	Daniel	1	7	The chief official gave them new names . He gave Daniel the name Belteshazzar . He gave Hananiah the name Shadrach . He gave Mishael the name Meshach . And he gave Azariah the name Abednego .
NIRV	Daniel	1	8	Daniel decided not to make himself “ unclean ” by eating the king ’ s food and drinking his wine . So he asked the chief official for a favor . He wanted permission not to make himself “ unclean ” with the king ’ s food and wine .
NIRV	Daniel	1	9	God had caused the official to be kind and friendly to Daniel .
NIRV	Daniel	1	10	But the official refused to do what Daniel asked for . He said , “ I ’ m afraid of the king . He is my master . He has decided what you and your three friends must eat and drink . Other young men are the same age as you . Why should he see you looking worse than them ? When he sees how you look , he might kill me. ”
NIRV	Daniel	1	11	So Daniel spoke to one of the guards . The chief official had appointed him over Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael and Azariah .
NIRV	Daniel	1	12	Daniel said to him , “ Please test us for ten days . Give us nothing but vegetables to eat . And give us only water to drink .
NIRV	Daniel	1	13	Then compare us with the young men who eat the king ’ s food . See how we look . After that , do what you want to. ”
NIRV	Daniel	1	14	So the guard agreed . He tested them for ten days .
NIRV	Daniel	1	15	After the ten days Daniel and his friends looked healthy and well fed . In fact , they looked better than any of the young men who ate the king ’ s food .
NIRV	Daniel	1	16	So the guard didn ’ t require them to eat the king ’ s special food . He didn ’ t require them to drink the king ’ s wine either . He gave them vegetables instead .
NIRV	Daniel	1	17	God gave knowledge and understanding to these four young men . So they understood all kinds of writings and subjects . And Daniel could understand all kinds of visions and dreams .
NIRV	Daniel	1	18	The three years the king had set for their training ended . So the chief official brought them to Nebuchadnezzar .
NIRV	Daniel	1	19	The king talked with them . He didn ’ t find anyone equal to Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael and Azariah . So they began to serve the king .
NIRV	Daniel	1	20	He asked them for advice in matters that required wisdom and understanding . The king always found their answers to be the best . Other men in his kingdom claimed to get knowledge by using magic . But the answers of Daniel and his friends were ten times better than theirs .
NIRV	Daniel	1	21	Daniel served in Babylon until the first year Cyrus ruled over the land of Babylon . Cyrus was king of Persia . Copyright ©

NIRV	Daniel	2	2	So the king sent for those who claimed to get knowledge by using magic . He also sent for those who practiced evil magic and those who studied the heavens . He wanted them to tell him what he had dreamed . They came in and stood in front of the king .
NIRV	Daniel	2	3	He said to them , “ I had a dream . It troubles me . So I want to know what it means. ”
NIRV	Daniel	2	4	Then those who studied the heavens answered the king . They spoke in Aramaic . They said , “ King Nebuchadnezzar , may you live forever ! Tell us what you dreamed . Then we ’ ll explain what it means. ”
NIRV	Daniel	2	5	The king replied to them , “ I have made up my mind . You must tell me what I dreamed . And you must tell me what it means . If you don ’ t , I ’ ll have you cut to pieces . And I ’ ll have your houses turned into piles of trash .
NIRV	Daniel	2	6	So tell me what I dreamed . Explain it to me . Then I ’ ll give you gifts . I ’ ll reward you . I ’ ll give you great honor . So tell me the dream . And tell me what it means. ”
NIRV	Daniel	2	7	Once more they replied , “ King Nebuchadnezzar , tell us what you dreamed . Then we ’ ll tell you what it means. ”
NIRV	Daniel	2	8	The king answered , “ I know what you are doing . You are trying to gain more time . You realize that I ’ ve made up my mind .
NIRV	Daniel	2	9	You must tell me the dream . If you don ’ t , you will pay for it . You have gotten together and made evil plans . You hope things will change . So you are telling me lies . But I want you to tell me what I dreamed . Then I ’ ll know that you can tell me what it means. ”
NIRV	Daniel	2	10	They answered the king , “ There is no one on earth who can do what you are asking ! No king has ever asked for anything like that . Not even a king as great and mighty as you has asked for it . Those who get knowledge by using magic have never been asked to do what you are asking . And those who study the heavens haven ’ t been asked to do it either .
NIRV	Daniel	2	11	What you are asking is much too hard . No one can tell you what you dreamed except the gods . And they don ’ t live among human beings. ”
NIRV	Daniel	2	12	That made the king very angry . He ordered that all the wise men in Babylon be put to death .
NIRV	Daniel	2	13	So the order was given to kill them . Men were sent out to look for Daniel and his friends . They were also supposed to be put to death .
NIRV	Daniel	2	14	Arioch was the commander of the king ’ s guard . He went out to put the wise men of Babylon to death . So Daniel spoke to him wisely and carefully .
NIRV	Daniel	2	15	He asked the king ’ s officer , “ Why did Nebuchadnezzar give a terrible order like that ? ” Then Arioch explained to Daniel what was going on .
NIRV	Daniel	2	16	When Daniel heard that , he went to the king . He told him he would explain the dream to him . But he needed more time .
NIRV	Daniel	2	17	Then Daniel returned to his house . He explained everything to his friends Hananiah , Mishael and Azariah .
NIRV	Daniel	2	18	He asked them to pray that the God of heaven would give him mercy . He wanted God to help him understand the mystery of the king ’ s dream . Then he and his friends wouldn ’ t be killed along with Babylon ’ s other wise men .
NIRV	Daniel	2	19	During that night , God gave Daniel a vision . He showed him what the mystery was all about . Then Daniel praised the God of heaven .
NIRV	Daniel	2	20	He said , “ May God be praised for ever and ever ! He is wise and powerful .
NIRV	Daniel	2	21	He changes times and seasons . He removes some kings from power . He causes other kings to rule . The wisdom of those who are wise comes from him . He gives knowledge to those who have understanding .
NIRV	Daniel	2	22	He explains deep and hidden things . He knows what happens in the darkest places . And where he is , everything is light .
NIRV	Daniel	2	23	God of my people of long ago , I thank and praise you . You have given me wisdom and power . You have made known to me what we asked you for . You have shown us the king ’ s dream. ” Daniel Tells the King What His Dream Means
NIRV	Daniel	2	24	Then Daniel went to Arioch . The king had appointed him to put the wise men of Babylon to death . Daniel said to him , “ Don ’ t kill the wise men of Babylon . Take me to the king . I ’ ll tell him what his dream means. ”
NIRV	Daniel	2	25	So Arioch took Daniel to the king at once . Arioch said , “ I have found a man among those you brought here from Judah . He can tell you what your dream means. ”
NIRV	Daniel	2	26	Nebuchadnezzar spoke to Daniel , who was also called Belteshazzar . The king asked him , “ Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream ? And can you tell me what it means ? ”
NIRV	Daniel	2	27	Daniel replied , “ You have asked us to explain a mystery to you . But no wise man can do that . And those who try to figure things out by using magic can ’ t do it either .
NIRV	Daniel	2	28	But there is a God in heaven who can explain mysteries . King Nebuchadnezzar , he has shown you what is going to happen . Here is what you dreamed while lying in bed . And here are the visions that passed through your mind .
NIRV	Daniel	2	29	“ Your Majesty , while you were still in bed your mind was troubled . You were thinking about things that haven ’ t happened yet . The God who explains mysteries showed these things to you .
NIRV	Daniel	2	30	Now the mystery has been explained to me . But it isn ’ t because I have greater wisdom than anyone else alive . It ’ s because God wants you to know what the mystery means , Your Majesty . He wants you to understand what went through your mind .
NIRV	Daniel	2	31	“ King Nebuchadnezzar , you looked up and saw a large statue standing in front of you . It was huge . It shone brightly . And it terrified you .
NIRV	Daniel	2	32	The head of the statue was made out of pure gold . Its chest and arms were made out of silver . Its stomach and thighs were made out of bronze .
NIRV	Daniel	2	33	Its legs were made out of iron . And its feet were partly iron and partly baked clay .
NIRV	Daniel	2	34	While you were watching , a rock was cut out . But human hands didn ’ t do it . It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay . It smashed them .
NIRV	Daniel	2	35	Then the iron and clay were broken to pieces . So were the bronze , silver and gold . All of them were broken to pieces . They became like straw on a threshing floor at harvest time . The wind blew them away without leaving a trace . But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain . It filled the whole earth .
NIRV	Daniel	2	36	“ This was your dream . Now I will tell you what it means .
NIRV	Daniel	2	37	King Nebuchadnezzar , you are the greatest king of all . The God of heaven has given you authority and power . He has given you might and glory .
NIRV	Daniel	2	38	He has put everyone under your control . He has also given you authority over the wild animals and the birds in the sky . It doesn ’ t matter where they live . He has made you ruler over all of them . You are that head of gold .
NIRV	Daniel	2	39	“ After you , another kingdom will take over . It won ’ t be as powerful as yours . Next , a third kingdom will rule over the whole earth . The bronze part of the statue stands for that kingdom .
NIRV	Daniel	2	40	Finally , there will be a fourth kingdom . It will be as strong as iron . Iron breaks and smashes everything to pieces . And the fourth kingdom will crush and break all the others .
NIRV	Daniel	2	41	You saw that the feet and toes were made out of iron and baked clay . And the fourth kingdom will be divided up . But it will still have some of the strength of iron . That ’ s why you saw iron mixed with clay .
NIRV	Daniel	2	42	The toes were partly iron and partly clay . And the fourth kingdom will be partly strong and partly weak .
NIRV	Daniel	2	43	You saw the iron mixed with baked clay . And the fourth kingdom will be made up of all kinds of people . They won ’ t hold together any more than iron mixes with clay .
NIRV	Daniel	2	44	“ In the time of those kings , the God of heaven will set up a kingdom . It will never be destroyed . And no other nation will ever take it over . It will crush all those other kingdoms . It will bring them to an end . But it will last forever .
NIRV	Daniel	2	45	That ’ s what the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain means . Human hands didn ’ t cut out the rock . It broke the statue to pieces . It smashed the iron , bronze , clay , silver and gold . “ The great God has shown you what will take place in days to come . The dream is true . And you can trust the meaning of it that I have explained to you. ”
NIRV	Daniel	2	46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar bowed low in front of Daniel . He wanted to honor him . So he ordered that an offering and incense be offered up to him .
NIRV	Daniel	2	47	The king said to Daniel , “ I ’ m sure your God is the greatest God of all . He is the Lord of kings . He explains mysteries . That ’ s why you were able to explain the mystery of my dream. ”
NIRV	Daniel	2	48	Then the king put Daniel in a position of authority . He gave him many gifts . He made him ruler over the city of Babylon and the towns around it . He put him in charge of all its other wise men .
NIRV	Daniel	2	49	The king also did what Daniel asked him to . He appointed Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego to help Daniel govern Babylon and the towns around it . Daniel himself remained at the royal court . Copyright ©

NIRV	Daniel	3	3	So the royal rulers , high officials and governors came together . So did the advisers , treasurers , judges and court officers . All the other officials joined them . They came to honor the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up . They stood in front of it .
NIRV	Daniel	3	90	feet tall and
NIRV	Daniel	3	9	They said , “ King Nebuchadnezzar , may you live forever !
NIRV	Daniel	3	2	Then the king sent for the royal rulers , high officials and governors . He sent for the advisers , treasurers , judges and court officers . And he sent for all the other officials of Babylon . He asked them to come to a special gathering to honor the statue he had set up .
NIRV	Daniel	3	4	Then a messenger called out loudly , “ Listen , you people who come from every nation ! Pay attention , you who speak other languages ! Here is what the king commands you to do .
NIRV	Daniel	3	5	You will soon hear the sound of horns and flutes . You will hear zithers , lyres , harps and pipes . In fact , you will hear all kinds of music . When you do , you must fall down and worship the gold statue . That is the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up .
NIRV	Daniel	3	6	If you don ’ t , you will be thrown into a blazing furnace right away. ”
NIRV	Daniel	3	7	All the people heard the sound of the horns and flutes . They heard the zithers , lyres , harps and other musical instruments . As soon as they did , they fell down and worshiped Nebuchadnezzar ’ s gold statue . They were people from all nations no matter what language they spoke .
NIRV	Daniel	3	8	At this time some people who studied the heavens came forward . They spoke against the Jews .
NIRV	Daniel	3	10	Your Majesty has commanded everyone to fall down and worship the gold statue . You told them to do it when they heard the horns , flutes , zithers , lyres , harps , pipes and other musical instruments .
NIRV	Daniel	3	11	If they didn ’ t , they would be thrown into a blazing furnace .
NIRV	Daniel	3	12	But you have appointed some Jews to help Daniel govern Babylon and the towns around it . Their names are Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego . They don ’ t pay any attention to you , King Nebuchadnezzar . They don ’ t serve your gods . And they refuse to worship the gold statue you have set up. ”
NIRV	Daniel	3	13	Nebuchadnezzar was very angry . He sent for Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego . So they were brought to him .
NIRV	Daniel	3	14	The king said to them , “ Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego , is what I heard about you true ? Don ’ t you serve my gods ? Don ’ t you worship the gold statue I set up ?
NIRV	Daniel	3	15	You will hear the horns , flutes , zithers , lyres , harps , pipes and other musical instruments . When you do , fall down and worship the statue I made . If you will , that ’ s very good . But if you won ’ t , you will be thrown at once into a blazing furnace . Then what god will be able to save you from my power ? ”
NIRV	Daniel	3	16	Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego replied to him . They said , “ King Nebuchadnezzar , we don ’ t need to talk about this anymore .
NIRV	Daniel	3	17	We might be thrown into the blazing furnace . But the God we serve is able to bring us out of it alive . He will save us from your power .
NIRV	Daniel	3	18	But we want you to know this , Your Majesty . Even if we knew that our God wouldn ’ t save us , we still wouldn ’ t serve your gods . We wouldn ’ t worship the gold statue you set up. ”
NIRV	Daniel	3	19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was very angry with Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego . The look on his face changed . And he ordered that the furnace be heated seven times hotter than usual .
NIRV	Daniel	3	20	He also gave some of the strongest soldiers in his army a command . He ordered them to tie up Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego . Then he told his men to throw them into the blazing furnace .
NIRV	Daniel	3	21	So they were tied up . Then they were thrown into the furnace . They were wearing their robes , pants , turbans and other clothes .
NIRV	Daniel	3	22	The king ’ s command was carried out quickly . The furnace was so hot that its flames killed the soldiers who threw Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego into it .
NIRV	Daniel	3	23	So the three men were firmly tied up . And they fell into the blazing furnace .
NIRV	Daniel	3	24	Then King Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet . He was so amazed he asked his advisers , “ Didn ’ t we tie up three men ? Didn ’ t we throw three men into the fire ? ” They replied , “ Yes , we did , Your Majesty. ”
NIRV	Daniel	3	25	The king said , “ Look ! I see four men walking around in the fire . They aren ’ t tied up . And the fire hasn ’ t even harmed them . The fourth man looks like a son of the gods. ”
NIRV	Daniel	3	26	Then the king approached the opening of the blazing furnace . He shouted , “ Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego , come out ! You who serve the Most High God , come here ! ” So they came out of the fire .
NIRV	Daniel	3	27	The royal rulers , high officials , governors and advisers crowded around them . They saw that the fire hadn ’ t harmed their bodies . Not one hair on their heads was burned . Their robes weren ’ t burned either . And they didn ’ t even smell like smoke .
NIRV	Daniel	3	28	Then Nebuchadnezzar said , “ May the God of Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego be praised ! He has sent his angel and saved his servants . They trusted in him . They refused to obey my command . They were willing to give up their lives . They would rather die than serve or worship any god except their own God .
NIRV	Daniel	3	29	No other god can save people this way . So I ’ m giving an order about the God of Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego . No one may say anything against him . That ’ s true no matter what language they speak . If they say anything against him , they ’ ll be cut to pieces . And their houses will be turned into piles of trash. ”
NIRV	Daniel	3	30	Then the king honored Shadrach , Meshach and Abednego . He gave them higher positions in the city of Babylon and the towns around it . Copyright ©

NIRV	Daniel	4	4	I was at home in my palace . I was content and very successful .
NIRV	Daniel	4	2	I am pleased to tell you what has happened . The Most High God has done miraculous signs and wonders for me .
NIRV	Daniel	4	3	His signs are great . His wonders are mighty . His kingdom will last forever . His rule will never end .
NIRV	Daniel	4	5	But I had a dream that made me afraid . I was lying in bed . Then dreams and visions passed through my mind . They terrified me .
NIRV	Daniel	4	6	So I commanded that all the wise men in Babylon be brought to me . I wanted them to tell me what my dream meant .
NIRV	Daniel	4	7	Those who try to figure things out by using magic came . So did those who study the heavens . I told all of them what I had dreamed . But they couldn ’ t tell me what it meant .
NIRV	Daniel	4	8	Finally , Daniel came to me . He is called Belteshazzar , after the name of my god . The spirit of the holy gods is in him . I told him my dream .
NIRV	Daniel	4	9	I said , “ Belteshazzar , you are chief of the magicians . I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you . No mystery is too hard for you to figure out . Here is my dream . Tell me what it means .
NIRV	Daniel	4	10	Here are the visions I saw while I was lying in bed . I looked up and saw a tree standing in the middle of the land . It was very tall .
NIRV	Daniel	4	11	It had grown to be large and strong . Its top touched the sky . It could be seen anywhere on earth .
NIRV	Daniel	4	12	Its leaves were beautiful . It had a lot of fruit on it . It provided enough food for people and animals . Under the tree , the wild animals found safety . The birds lived in its branches . Every creature was fed from that tree .
NIRV	Daniel	4	13	“ While I was still lying in bed , I looked up . In my visions , I saw a holy one . He was a messenger . He was coming down from heaven .
NIRV	Daniel	4	14	He called out in a loud voice . He said , ‘ Cut down the tree . Break off its branches . Strip off its leaves . Scatter its fruit . Let the animals under it run away . Let the birds in its branches fly off .
NIRV	Daniel	4	15	But leave the stump with its roots in the ground . Let it stay in the field . Put a band of iron and bronze around it . “ ‘ Let King Nebuchadnezzar become wet with the dew of heaven . Let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth .
NIRV	Daniel	4	16	Let him no longer have the mind of a man . Instead , let him be given the mind of an animal . Let him stay that way until seven periods of time pass by .
NIRV	Daniel	4	17	“ ‘ The decision is announced by holy messengers . So all who are alive will know that the Most High God is King . He rules over all kingdoms on earth . He gives them to anyone he wants . Sometimes he puts the least important people in charge of them. ’
NIRV	Daniel	4	18	“ This is the dream I , King Nebuchadnezzar , had . Now tell me what it means , Belteshazzar . None of the wise men in my kingdom can explain it to me . But you can . After all , the spirit of the holy gods is in you. ” Daniel Explains Nebuchadnezzar ’ s Dream
NIRV	Daniel	4	19	Daniel , who was also called Belteshazzar , was very bewildered for a while . His thoughts terrified him . So the king said , “ Belteshazzar , don ’ t let the dream or its meaning make you afraid. ” Belteshazzar answered , “ My master , I wish the dream were about your enemies ! I wish its meaning had to do with them !
NIRV	Daniel	4	20	You saw a tree . It grew to be large and strong . Its top touched the sky . It could be seen from anywhere on earth .
NIRV	Daniel	4	21	Its leaves were beautiful . It had a lot of fruit on it . It provided enough food for people and animals . Under the tree , the wild animals found safety . The birds lived in its branches .
NIRV	Daniel	4	22	Your Majesty , you are that tree ! You have become great and strong . Your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky . Your rule has spread to all parts of the earth .
NIRV	Daniel	4	23	“ Your Majesty , you saw a holy one . He was a messenger . He came down from heaven . He said , ‘ Cut down the tree . Destroy it . But leave the stump with its roots in the ground . Let it stay in the field . Put an iron and bronze band around it . Let King Nebuchadnezzar become wet with the dew of heaven . Let him live with the wild animals . Let him stay that way until seven periods of time pass by. ’
NIRV	Daniel	4	24	“ Your Majesty , here is what your dream means . The Most High God has given an order against you .
NIRV	Daniel	4	25	You will be driven away from people . You will live with the wild animals . You will eat grass just as an ox does . You will become wet with the dew of heaven . Seven periods of time will pass by for you . Then you will recognize that the Most High God rules over all kingdoms on earth . He gives them to anyone he wants .
NIRV	Daniel	4	26	But he gave a command to leave the stump of the tree along with its roots . That means your kingdom will be given back to you . It will happen when you recognize that the God of heaven rules .
NIRV	Daniel	4	27	So , Your Majesty , I hope you will accept my advice . Stop being sinful . Do what is right . Give up your evil practices . Show kindness to those who are being treated badly . Then perhaps things will continue to go well with you. ” Nebuchadnezzar ’ s Dream Comes True
NIRV	Daniel	4	28	All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar .
NIRV	Daniel	4	29	It took place twelve months later . He was walking on the roof of his palace in Babylon .
NIRV	Daniel	4	30	He said , “ Isn ’ t this the great Babylon I have built as a place for my royal palace ? I used my mighty power to build it . It shows how glorious my majesty is. ”
NIRV	Daniel	4	31	He was still speaking when he heard a voice from heaven . It said , “ King Nebuchadnezzar , here is what has been ordered concerning you . Your royal authority has been taken from you .
NIRV	Daniel	4	32	You will be driven away from people . You will live with the wild animals . You will eat grass just as an ox does . Seven periods of time will pass by for you . Then you will recognize that the Most High God rules over all kingdoms on earth . He gives them to anyone he wants. ”
NIRV	Daniel	4	33	What had been said about King Nebuchadnezzar came true at once . He was driven away from people . He ate grass just as an ox does . His body became wet with the dew of heaven . He stayed that way until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle . His nails became like the claws of a bird .
NIRV	Daniel	4	34	At the end of that time I , Nebuchadnezzar , looked up toward heaven . My mind became clear again . Then I praised the Most High God . I gave honor and glory to the God who lives forever . His rule will last forever . His kingdom will never end .
NIRV	Daniel	4	35	He considers all the nations on earth to be nothing . He does as he pleases with the powers of heaven . He does what he wants with the nations of the earth . No one can hold back his hand . No one can say to him , “ What have you done ? ”
NIRV	Daniel	4	36	My honor and glory were returned to me when my mind became clear again . The glory of my kingdom was given back to me . My advisers and nobles came to me . And I was put back on my throne . I became even greater than I had been before .
NIRV	Daniel	4	37	Now I , Nebuchadnezzar , give praise and honor and glory to the King of heaven . Everything he does is right . All his ways are fair . He is able to bring down those who live proudly . Copyright ©

NIRV	Daniel	5	5	Suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared . They wrote something on the plaster of the palace wall . It happened near the lampstand . The king watched the hand as it wrote .
NIRV	Daniel	5	2	While Belshazzar was drinking his wine , he gave orders to his servants . He commanded them to bring in some gold and silver cups . They were the cups his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem . Belshazzar had them brought in so everyone could drink from them . That included the king himself , his nobles , his wives and his concubines .
NIRV	Daniel	5	3	So the servants brought in the gold cups . The cups had been taken from God ’ s temple in Jerusalem . The king and his nobles drank from them . So did his wives and concubines .
NIRV	Daniel	5	4	As they drank the wine , they praised their gods . The statues of those gods were made out of gold , silver , bronze , iron , wood or stone .
NIRV	Daniel	5	6	His face turned pale . He was so afraid that his legs became weak . And his knees were knocking together .
NIRV	Daniel	5	7	The king sent for those who try to figure things out by using magic . He also sent for those who study the heavens . All of them were wise men in Babylon . Then the king spoke to them . He said , “ I want one of you to read this writing . I want you to tell me what it means . Whoever does this will be dressed in purple clothes . A gold chain will be put around his neck . And he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom. ”
NIRV	Daniel	5	8	Then all the king ’ s wise men came in . But they couldn ’ t read the writing . They couldn ’ t tell him what it meant .
NIRV	Daniel	5	9	So King Belshazzar became even more terrified . His face grew more pale . And his nobles were bewildered .
NIRV	Daniel	5	10	The queen heard the king and his nobles talking . So she came into the dining hall . “ King Belshazzar , may you live forever ! ” she said . “ Don ’ t be afraid ! Don ’ t look so pale !
NIRV	Daniel	5	11	I know a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him . He has understanding and wisdom and good sense just like the gods . He was chief of those who tried to figure things out by using magic . And he was in charge of those who studied the heavens . Your father , King Nebuchadnezzar , appointed him to that position .
NIRV	Daniel	5	12	King Nebuchadnezzar did this because he saw what the man could do . This man ’ s name is Daniel . Your father called him Belteshazzar . He has a clever mind and knowledge and understanding . He is also able to tell what dreams mean . He can explain riddles and solve hard problems . Send for him . He ’ ll tell you what the writing means. ”
NIRV	Daniel	5	13	So Daniel was brought to the king . The king said to him , “ Are you Daniel ? Are you one of the prisoners my father the king brought here from Judah ?
NIRV	Daniel	5	14	I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you . I ’ ve also heard that you have understanding and good sense and special wisdom .
NIRV	Daniel	5	15	The wise men and those who practice magic were brought to me . They were asked to read this writing and tell me what it means . But they couldn ’ t .
NIRV	Daniel	5	16	I have heard that you are able to explain things and solve hard problems . I hope you can read this writing and tell me what it means . If you can , you will be dressed in purple clothes . A gold chain will be put around your neck . And you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom. ”
NIRV	Daniel	5	17	Then Daniel answered the king . He said , “ You can keep your gifts for yourself . You can give your rewards to someone else . But I will read the writing for you . I ’ ll tell you what it means .
NIRV	Daniel	5	18	“ Your Majesty , the Most High God was good to your father Nebuchadnezzar . He gave him authority and greatness and glory and honor .
NIRV	Daniel	5	19	God gave him a high position . Then people from every nation became afraid of the king . That was true no matter what language they spoke . The king put to death anyone he wanted to . He spared anyone he wanted to spare . He gave high positions to anyone he wanted to . And he brought down anyone he wanted to bring down .
NIRV	Daniel	5	20	But his heart became very stubborn and proud . So he was removed from his royal throne . His glory was stripped away from him .
NIRV	Daniel	5	21	He was driven away from people . He was given the mind of an animal . He lived with the wild donkeys . He ate grass just as an ox does . His body became wet with the dew of heaven . He stayed that way until he recognized that the Most High God rules over all kingdoms on earth . He puts anyone he wants to in charge of them .
NIRV	Daniel	5	22	“ But you knew all that , Belshazzar . After all , you are Nebuchadnezzar ’ s son . In spite of that , you are still proud .
NIRV	Daniel	5	23	You have taken your stand against the Lord of heaven . You had your servants bring cups from his temple to you . You and your nobles drank wine from them . So did your wives and concubines . You praised your gods . The statues of those gods are made out of silver , gold , bronze , iron , wood or stone . They can ’ t see or hear or understand anything . But you didn ’ t honor God . He holds in his hand your very life and everything you do .
NIRV	Daniel	5	24	So he sent the hand that wrote on the wall .
NIRV	Daniel	5	25	“ Here is what was written . mene , mene , tekel , parsin
NIRV	Daniel	5	26	“ And here is what these words mean . The word Mene means that God has limited the time of your rule . He has brought it to an end .
NIRV	Daniel	5	27	The word Tekel means that you have been weighed on scales . And you haven ’ t measured up to God ’ s standard .
NIRV	Daniel	5	28	The word Peres means that your authority over your kingdom will be taken away from you . It will be given to the Medes and Persians. ”
NIRV	Daniel	5	29	Then Belshazzar commanded his servants to dress Daniel in purple clothes . So they did . They put a gold chain around his neck . And he was made the third highest ruler in the kingdom .
NIRV	Daniel	5	30	That very night Belshazzar , the king of Babylon , was killed .
NIRV	Daniel	5	31	His kingdom was given to Darius the Mede . Darius was
NIRV	Daniel	5	62	years old . Copyright ©

NIRV	Daniel	6	6	So the two leaders and the royal rulers went as a group to the king . They said , “ King Darius , may you live forever !
NIRV	Daniel	6	120	royal rulers over his entire kingdom .
NIRV	Daniel	6	2	He placed three leaders over them . One of the leaders was Daniel . The royal rulers were made accountable to the three leaders . Then the king wouldn ’ t lose any of his wealth .
NIRV	Daniel	6	3	Daniel did a better job than the other two leaders or any of the royal rulers . He was an unusually good and able man . So the king planned to put him in charge of the whole kingdom .
NIRV	Daniel	6	4	But the other two leaders and the royal rulers heard about it . So they looked for a reason to bring charges against Daniel . They tried to find something wrong with the way he ran the government . But they weren ’ t able to . They couldn ’ t find any fault with his work . He could always be trusted . He never did anything wrong . And he always did what he was supposed to .
NIRV	Daniel	6	5	Finally these men said , “ We want to bring charges against this man Daniel . But It ’ s almost impossible for us to come up with a reason to do it . If we find a reason , it will have to be in connection with the law of his God. ”
NIRV	Daniel	6	7	All the royal leaders , high officials , royal rulers , advisers and governors want to make a suggestion . We ’ ve agreed that you should give an order . And you should make sure it ’ s obeyed . Your Majesty , here is the command you should make your people obey for the next
NIRV	Daniel	6	30	days your people could pray only to you . They could not pray to anyone else , whether god or human being . If they did , they would be thrown into the lions ’ den. ” The king answered , “ The order must still be obeyed . It ’ s what the law of the Medes and Persians requires . So it can ’ t be changed. ”
NIRV	Daniel	6	8	Now give the order . Write it down in the law of the Medes and Persians . Then it can ’ t be changed. ”
NIRV	Daniel	6	9	So King Darius put the order in writing .
NIRV	Daniel	6	10	Daniel found out that the king had signed the order . In spite of that , he did just as he had always done before . He went home to his upstairs room . Its windows opened toward Jerusalem . He went to his room three times a day to pray . He got down on his knees and gave thanks to his God .
NIRV	Daniel	6	11	Some of the other royal officials went to where Daniel was staying . They saw him praying and asking God for help .
NIRV	Daniel	6	12	So they went to the king . They spoke to him about his royal order . They said , “ Your Majesty , didn ’ t you sign an official order ? It said that for the next
NIRV	Daniel	6	13	Then they spoke to the king again . They said , “ Daniel is one of the prisoners from Judah . He doesn ’ t pay any attention to you , Your Majesty . He doesn ’ t obey the order you put in writing . He still prays to his God three times a day. ”
NIRV	Daniel	6	14	When the king heard this , he was very upset . He didn ’ t want Daniel to be harmed in any way . Until sunset , he did everything he could to save him .
NIRV	Daniel	6	15	Then the men went as a group to King Darius . They said to him , “ Your Majesty , remember that no order or command you give can be changed . That ’ s what the law of the Medes and Persians requires. ”
NIRV	Daniel	6	16	So the king gave the order . Daniel was brought out and thrown into the lions ’ den . The king said to him , “ You always serve your God faithfully . So may he save you ! ”
NIRV	Daniel	6	17	A stone was brought and placed over the opening of the den . The king sealed it with his own special ring . He also sealed it with the rings of his nobles . Then nothing could be done to help Daniel .
NIRV	Daniel	6	18	The king returned to his palace . He didn ’ t eat anything that night . He didn ’ t ask for anything to be brought to him for his enjoyment . And he couldn ’ t sleep .
NIRV	Daniel	6	19	As soon as the sun began to rise , the king got up . He hurried to the lions ’ den .
NIRV	Daniel	6	20	When he got near it , he called out to Daniel . His voice was filled with great concern . He said , “ Daniel ! You serve the living God . You always serve him faithfully . So has he been able to save you from the lions ? ”
NIRV	Daniel	6	21	Daniel answered , “ Your Majesty , may you live forever !
NIRV	Daniel	6	22	My God sent his angel . And his angel shut the mouths of the lions . They haven ’ t hurt me at all . That ’ s because I haven ’ t done anything wrong in God ’ s sight . I ’ ve never done anything wrong to you either , Your Majesty. ”
NIRV	Daniel	6	23	The king was filled with joy . He ordered his servants to lift Daniel out of the den . So they did . They didn ’ t see any wounds on him . That ’ s because he had trusted in his God .
NIRV	Daniel	6	24	Then the king gave another order . The men who had said bad things about Daniel were brought in . They were thrown into the lions ’ den . So were their wives and children . Before they hit the bottom of the den , the lions attacked them . And the lions crushed all their bones .
NIRV	Daniel	6	25	Then King Darius wrote to people of all nations , no matter what language they spoke . He said , “ May you have great success !
NIRV	Daniel	6	26	“ I order people in every part of my kingdom to respect and honor Daniel ’ s God . “ He is the living God . He will live forever . His kingdom will not be destroyed . His rule will never end .
NIRV	Daniel	6	27	He sets people free and saves them . He does miraculous signs and wonders . He does them in the heavens and on the earth . He has saved Daniel from the power of the lions. ”
NIRV	Daniel	6	28	So Daniel had success while Darius was king . Things went well with Daniel during the rule of Cyrus , the Persian . Copyright ©

NIRV	Daniel	7	7	“ After that , in my vision I looked up and saw a fourth animal . It was terrifying and very powerful . It had large iron teeth . It crushed those it attacked and ate them up . It stomped on anything that was left . It was different from the other animals . And it had ten horns .
NIRV	Daniel	7	2	Daniel said , “ I had a vision at night . I looked up and saw the four winds of heaven . They were stirring up the Mediterranean Sea .
NIRV	Daniel	7	3	Four large animals came up out of the sea . Each one was different from the others .
NIRV	Daniel	7	4	“ The first animal was like a lion . It had the wings of an eagle . I watched until its wings were torn off . Then it was lifted up from the ground . It stood on two feet like a human being . And the mind of a human being was given to it .
NIRV	Daniel	7	5	“ I saw a second animal . It looked like a bear . It was raised up on one of its sides . And it had three ribs between its teeth . It was told , ‘ Get up ! Eat meat until you are full ! ’
NIRV	Daniel	7	6	“ After that , I saw another animal . It looked like a leopard . On its back were four wings like the wings of a bird . The animal I saw had four heads . And it was given authority to rule .
NIRV	Daniel	7	8	“ I thought about the horns . Then I saw another horn . It was a little one . It grew up among the other horns . Three of the first horns were pulled up by their roots to make room for it . The little horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being . Its mouth was always bragging .
NIRV	Daniel	7	9	“ As I watched , “ thrones were set in place . The Eternal God took his seat . His clothes were as white as snow . The hair on his head was white like wool . His throne was blazing with fire . And flames were all around its wheels .
NIRV	Daniel	7	10	A river of fire was flowing . It was coming out from in front of God . Thousands and thousands of angels served him . Millions of them stood in front of him . The court was seated . And the books were opened .
NIRV	Daniel	7	11	“ Then I continued to watch because of the way the horn was bragging . I kept looking until the fourth animal was killed . I watched until its body was destroyed . It was thrown into the blazing fire .
NIRV	Daniel	7	12	The authority of the other animals had been stripped away from them . But they were allowed to live for a period of time .
NIRV	Daniel	7	13	“ In my vision I saw one who looked like a son of man . He was coming with the clouds of heaven . He approached the Eternal God . He was led right up to him .
NIRV	Daniel	7	14	And he was given authority , glory and a kingdom . People of all nations , no matter what language they spoke , worshiped him . His authority will last forever . It will not pass away . His kingdom will never be destroyed . An Angel Tells Daniel What His Dream Means
NIRV	Daniel	7	15	“ My spirit was troubled . The visions that passed through my mind upset me .
NIRV	Daniel	7	16	I approached an angel who was standing there . I asked him what all these things really meant . “ So he explained to me what everything meant .
NIRV	Daniel	7	17	He said , ‘ The four large animals stand for four kings . The kings will appear on the earth .
NIRV	Daniel	7	18	But the holy people of the Most High God will receive the kingdom . They will possess it forever . It will belong to them for ever and ever. ’
NIRV	Daniel	7	19	“ Then I wanted to know what the fourth animal stood for . It was different from the others . It was the most terrifying of all . It had iron teeth and bronze claws . It crushed everyone it attacked and ate them up . It stomped on anything that was left .
NIRV	Daniel	7	20	I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head . And I wanted to know about the other horn that grew up later . It caused three of the ten horns to fall out . It appeared to be stronger than the others . It had eyes . And its mouth was always bragging .
NIRV	Daniel	7	21	I saw that the horn was at war with God ’ s holy people . It was winning the battle over them .
NIRV	Daniel	7	22	But then the Eternal God came . He decided in favor of his holy people . So the time came when the kingdom was given to them .
NIRV	Daniel	7	23	“ Here ’ s how the angel explained it to me . He said , ‘ The fourth animal stands for a fourth kingdom . It will appear on earth . It will be different from the other kingdoms . It will eat up the whole earth . It will stomp on it and crush it .
NIRV	Daniel	7	24	The ten horns stand for ten kings . They will come from the fourth kingdom . After them another king will appear . He will be different from the earlier ones . He ’ ll bring three kings under his control .
NIRV	Daniel	7	25	He ’ ll speak against the Most High God . He ’ ll treat God ’ s holy people badly . He will try to change the times and laws that were given by God . God ’ s holy people will be placed under his power for three and a half years .
NIRV	Daniel	7	26	“ ‘ But the court will be seated . And the power of that king will be taken away from him . It will be completely destroyed forever .
NIRV	Daniel	7	27	Then the authority , power and greatness of all the kingdoms on earth will be taken from them . And all they had will be given to the holy people of the Most High God . His kingdom will last forever . Every ruler will worship and obey him. ’
NIRV	Daniel	7	28	“ That ’ s all I saw . My thoughts deeply troubled me . My face turned pale . But I kept those things to myself. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Daniel	8	8	The goat became very great . But when its power was at its greatest , the goat ’ s large horn was broken off . In its place four large horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven .
NIRV	Daniel	8	2	In my vision I saw myself in the city of Susa . It has high walls around it . It is in the land of Elam . In the vision I was beside the Ulai Canal .
NIRV	Daniel	8	3	I looked up and saw a ram that had two horns . It was standing beside the canal . Its horns were long . One of them was longer than the other . But that horn grew up later .
NIRV	Daniel	8	4	I watched the ram as it charged toward the west . It also charged toward the north and the south . No animal could stand up against it . Not one of them could save anyone from its power . It did as it pleased . And it became great .
NIRV	Daniel	8	5	I was thinking about all of this . Then a goat suddenly came from the west . It had a large horn between its eyes . The goat raced across the whole earth without even touching the ground .
NIRV	Daniel	8	6	It came toward the ram that had the two horns . It was the ram I had seen standing beside the canal . The goat was very angry . It charged at the ram .
NIRV	Daniel	8	7	I saw it attack the ram with mighty force . It struck the ram and broke the ram ’ s two horns . The ram didn ’ t have the power to stand up against it . The goat knocked the ram to the ground and stomped on it . No one could save the ram from the goat ’ s power .
NIRV	Daniel	8	9	Out of one of the four horns came another horn . It was small at first but became more and more powerful . It grew to the south and to the east and toward the beautiful land of Israel .
NIRV	Daniel	8	10	It grew until it reached the stars in the sky . It threw some of them down to the earth . And it stomped on them .
NIRV	Daniel	8	11	It set itself up to be as great as the commander of the Lord ’ s army . It took away the daily sacrifices from the Lord . And his temple in Jerusalem was thrown down .
NIRV	Daniel	8	12	Because many of the Lord ’ s people refused to obey him , they were handed over to the horn . The daily sacrifices were also given over to it . The horn was successful no matter what it did . And true worship of God was thrown down to the ground .
NIRV	Daniel	8	13	Then I heard a holy angel speaking . Another holy angel spoke to him . He asked , “ How long will it take for the vision to come true ? When will the daily sacrifices be stopped ? When will those who refuse to obey God be destroyed ? When will the temple be handed over to an enemy ? And when will some of the Lord ’ s people be stomped on ? ”
NIRV	Daniel	8	14	One of the holy angels said to me , “ It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings . Then the temple will be made holy again. ” Gabriel Tells Daniel What His Vision Means
NIRV	Daniel	8	15	I was having the vision . And I was trying to understand it . Then I saw someone who looked like a man .
NIRV	Daniel	8	16	I heard a voice from the Ulai Canal . It called out , “ Gabriel , tell Daniel what his vision means. ”
NIRV	Daniel	8	17	Gabriel came close to where I was standing . I was terrified and fell down flat with my face toward the ground . Here is what he said to me . “ Son of man , I want you to understand the vision . It ’ s about the time of the end. ”
NIRV	Daniel	8	18	While he was speaking to me , I was sound asleep . I lay with my face on the ground . Then he touched me . He raised me to my feet .
NIRV	Daniel	8	19	He said , “ I am going to tell you what will happen later . It will take place when God is angry . The vision is about the appointed time of the end .
NIRV	Daniel	8	20	You saw a ram that had two horns . It stands for the kings of Media and Persia .
NIRV	Daniel	8	21	The goat stands for the king of Greece . The large horn between its eyes is the first king .
NIRV	Daniel	8	22	Four horns took the horn ’ s place when it was broken off . They stand for four kingdoms that will come from his nation . But those kingdoms will not be as powerful as his .
NIRV	Daniel	8	23	“ Toward the end of their rule , those who refuse to obey God will become completely evil . Then another king will appear . He will have a scary-looking face . He will be a master at making clever plans .
NIRV	Daniel	8	24	He will become very strong . But he will not get that way by his own power . People will be amazed at the way he destroys everything . He will be successful no matter what he does . He will destroy mighty people . Those mighty people are God ’ s holy people .
NIRV	Daniel	8	25	He will tell lies in order to succeed . He will think he is more important than anyone else . When people feel safe , he will destroy many of them . He will stand up against the greatest Prince of all . Then he will be destroyed . But he will not be killed by human beings .
NIRV	Daniel	8	26	“ The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given to you is true . But seal up the vision . It is about a time far off. ”
NIRV	Daniel	8	27	I , Daniel , was worn out . I was too tired to get up for several days . Then I got up and returned to my work for the king . The vision bewildered me . I couldn ’ t understand it . Copyright ©

NIRV	Daniel	9	9	You are the Lord our God . You show us your tender love . You forgive us . But we have turned against you .
NIRV	Daniel	9	2	In that year I learned from the Scriptures that Jerusalem would remain destroyed for
NIRV	Daniel	9	70	‘ weeks ’ for your people and your holy city . During that time , acts against God ’ s law will be stopped . Sin will come to an end . And the evil things people do will be paid for . Then everyone will always do what is right . Everything that has been made known in visions and prophecies will come true . And the Most Holy Room in the temple will be anointed .
NIRV	Daniel	9	3	So I prayed to the Lord God . I begged him . I made many appeals to him . I didn ’ t eat anything . I put on the rough clothing people wear when they ’ re sad . And I sat down in ashes .
NIRV	Daniel	9	4	I prayed to the Lord my God . I admitted that we had sinned . I said , “ Lord , you are a great and wonderful God . You keep the covenant you made with all those who love you and obey your commandments . You show them your love .
NIRV	Daniel	9	5	We have sinned and done what is wrong . We have been evil . We have refused to obey you . We have turned away from your commands and laws .
NIRV	Daniel	9	6	We haven ’ t listened to your servants the prophets . They spoke in your name to our kings , our princes and our people of long ago . They also brought your message to all our people in the land .
NIRV	Daniel	9	7	“ Lord , you always do what is right . But we are covered with shame today . We are the people of Judah and Jerusalem . All of us are Israelites , no matter where we live . We are now living in many countries . You scattered us among the nations because we weren ’ t faithful to you .
NIRV	Daniel	9	8	Lord , we are covered with shame . So are our kings and princes , and our people of long ago . We have sinned against you .
NIRV	Daniel	9	10	You are the Lord our God . But we haven ’ t obeyed you . We haven ’ t kept the laws you gave us through your servants the prophets .
NIRV	Daniel	9	11	All the people of Israel have broken your law and turned away from it . They have refused to obey you . “ Curses and warnings are written down in the Law of Moses . He was your servant . Those curses have been poured out on us . That ’ s because we have sinned against you .
NIRV	Daniel	9	12	The warnings you gave us and our rulers have come true . You have brought great trouble on us . Nothing like what has been done to Jerusalem has ever happened anywhere else on earth .
NIRV	Daniel	9	13	The curses that are written in the Law of Moses have fallen on us . We have received nothing but trouble . You are the Lord our God . But we haven ’ t asked for your favor . We haven ’ t turned away from our sins . We ’ ve refused to pay attention to the laws you gave us .
NIRV	Daniel	9	14	Lord , you didn ’ t hold back from bringing this trouble on us . You always do what is right . But we haven ’ t obeyed you .
NIRV	Daniel	9	15	“ Lord our God , you used your mighty hand to bring your people out of Egypt . You made a name for yourself . It is still great to this day . But we have sinned . We ’ ve done what is wrong .
NIRV	Daniel	9	16	Lord , you saved your people before . So turn your great anger away from Jerusalem again . After all , it is your city . It ’ s your holy mountain . You have made those who live around us think little of Jerusalem and your people . That ’ s because we have sinned . Our people before us did evil things too .
NIRV	Daniel	9	17	“ Our God , hear my prayers . Pay attention to the appeals I make to you . Lord , have mercy on your temple that has been destroyed . Do it for your own honor .
NIRV	Daniel	9	18	Our God , please listen to us . The city that belongs to you has been destroyed . Open your eyes and see it . We aren ’ t asking you to answer our prayers because we are godly . Instead , we ’ re asking you to do it because you love us so much .
NIRV	Daniel	9	19	Lord , please listen ! Lord , please forgive us ! Lord , hear our prayers ! Take action for your own honor . Our God , please don ’ t wait . Your city and your people belong to you. ” Gabriel Tells Daniel About Seventy “ Weeks ”
NIRV	Daniel	9	20	I was speaking and praying . I was admitting that I and my people Israel had sinned . I was making my appeal to the Lord my God . My appeal was about his holy mountain of Zion .
NIRV	Daniel	9	21	While I was still praying , Gabriel came to me . I had seen him in my earlier vision . He flew over to me very quickly . It was about the time when the evening sacrifice is offered .
NIRV	Daniel	9	22	He helped me understand . He said , “ Daniel , I have come now to help you know and understand these things .
NIRV	Daniel	9	23	You are highly respected . So as soon as you began to pray , the Lord gave you a message . I have come to tell you what it is . Here is how you must understand the vision .
NIRV	Daniel	9	24	“ The Lord has appointed
NIRV	Daniel	9	25	“ Here is what I want you to know and understand . There will be seven ‘ weeks. ’ Then there will be
NIRV	Daniel	9	62	‘ weeks , ’ the Anointed King will be put to death . His followers will desert him . And everything he has will be taken away from him . The army of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the temple . The end will come like a flood . War will continue until the end . The Lord has ordered that many places be destroyed .
NIRV	Daniel	9	26	After the
NIRV	Daniel	9	27	A covenant will be put into effect with many people for one ‘ week. ’ In the middle of the ‘ week ’ sacrifices and offerings will come to an end . And at the temple a hated thing that destroys will be set up . It will remain until that ruler who will come is destroyed . Then he will experience what the Lord has ordered. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Daniel	10	10	A hand touched me . It pulled me up on my hands and knees . I began to tremble with fear .
NIRV	Daniel	10	2	At that time I was very sad for three weeks .
NIRV	Daniel	10	3	I didn ’ t eat any rich food . No meat or wine touched my lips . I didn ’ t use any lotions at all until the three weeks were over .
NIRV	Daniel	10	4	I was standing on the bank of the great Tigris River . It was the 24th day of the first month .
NIRV	Daniel	10	5	I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen clothes . He had a belt around his waist . It was made out of fine gold from Uphaz .
NIRV	Daniel	10	6	His body gleamed like topaz . His face shone like lightning . His eyes were like flaming torches . His arms and legs were as bright as polished bronze . And his voice was like the sound of a large crowd .
NIRV	Daniel	10	7	I was the only one who saw the vision . The people who were there with me didn ’ t see it . But they were so terrified that they ran and hid .
NIRV	Daniel	10	8	So I was left alone as I was watching this great vision . I felt very weak . My face turned as pale as death . And I was helpless .
NIRV	Daniel	10	9	Then I heard the man speak . As I listened to him , I fell sound asleep . My face was toward the ground .
NIRV	Daniel	10	11	The man said , “ Daniel , you are highly respected . Think carefully about what I am going to say to you . And stand up . God has sent me to you. ” When he said that , I trembled as I stood up .
NIRV	Daniel	10	12	He continued , “ Do not be afraid , Daniel . You decided to get more understanding . You made yourself humble as you worshiped your God . Since the first day you did those things , your words were heard . I have come to give you an answer .
NIRV	Daniel	10	13	But the prince of Persia opposed me for
NIRV	Daniel	10	21	But first I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth . No one gives me any help against those princes except Michael . He is your leader . Copyright ©
NIRV	Daniel	10	14	Now I have come to explain the vision to you . I will tell you what will happen to your people . The vision shows what will take place in days to come. ”
NIRV	Daniel	10	15	While he was telling me these things , I bowed with my face toward the ground . I wasn ’ t able to speak .
NIRV	Daniel	10	16	Then someone who looked like a man touched my lips . I opened my mouth . I began to speak to the one who was standing in front of me . I said , “ My master , I ’ m greatly troubled because of the vision I ’ ve seen . And I feel very weak .
NIRV	Daniel	10	17	How can I talk with you ? My strength is gone . In fact , I can hardly breathe. ”
NIRV	Daniel	10	18	The one who looked like a man touched me again . He gave me strength .
NIRV	Daniel	10	19	“ Do not be afraid , ” he said . “ You are highly respected . May peace be with you ! Be strong now . Be strong. ” When he spoke to me , I became stronger . I said , “ Speak , my master . You have given me strength. ”
NIRV	Daniel	10	20	So he said , “ Do you know why I have come to you ? Soon I will return to fight against the prince of Persia . When I go , the prince of Greece will come .

NIRV	Daniel	11	11	“ Another king of Egypt will march out with mighty force . He will be very angry . By then , another person will have become king in Syria . The king of Egypt will come to fight against him . The king of Syria will gather a huge army . But that army will lose the battle .
NIRV	Daniel	11	1	I stepped forward to help him and keep him safe . It was the first year that Darius , the Mede , was king . The Kings of Egypt and Syria
NIRV	Daniel	11	2	“ Now then , what I ’ m about to tell you is true . Three more kings will come to power in Persia . Then a fourth one will rule . He will be much richer than all the others . He will use his wealth to gain power . And he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece .
NIRV	Daniel	11	3	After him , a mighty king will come to power . He will rule with great power and do as he pleases .
NIRV	Daniel	11	4	Not long after his rule ends , his kingdom will be broken up . It will be divided up into four parts . His children will not receive it when he dies . And it will not be as strong as his kingdom . It will be pulled up by the roots . And it will be given to others .
NIRV	Daniel	11	5	“ The king of Egypt will become strong . But one of his commanders will become even stronger . He will rule over his own kingdom with great power .
NIRV	Daniel	11	6	After many years , the two kingdoms will join forces . The daughter of the next king of Egypt will go to the king of Syria . She will join forces with him . But she will not hold on to her power . And he and his power will not last either . In those days she and her attendants will die . They will die when the people she trusts lie to her . The same thing will happen to her father and the one who helped her .
NIRV	Daniel	11	7	“ Someone from her family line will take her place . He will attack the army of the next king of Syria . Then he will enter his fort . He will fight against that army and win .
NIRV	Daniel	11	8	He will take the metal statues of their gods . He will also take away their priceless objects of silver and gold . He will carry everything off to Egypt . For many years he will leave the king of Syria alone .
NIRV	Daniel	11	9	Then the king of Syria will march into territory that was controlled by Egypt . After that , he will return to his own country .
NIRV	Daniel	11	10	His sons will prepare for war . They will gather a huge army . It will sweep along like a mighty flood . The army will fight its way as far as one of the Egyptian forts .
NIRV	Daniel	11	12	His soldiers will be carried off . Then the king of Egypt will be filled with pride . He will kill many thousands of soldiers . But his success will not last .
NIRV	Daniel	11	13	The king of Syria will bring another army together . It will be larger than the first one . After several years , he will march out with a huge army . It will have everything it needs for battle .
NIRV	Daniel	11	14	“ In those times many people will rise up against the next king of Egypt . Lawless people in your own nation will refuse to obey him . That is what you saw in your vision . But they will not succeed .
NIRV	Daniel	11	15	Then the king of Syria will go to a certain city that has high walls around it . He will build ramps against them . And he will capture that city . The forces of Egypt will not have the power to stop him . Even their best troops will not be strong enough to stand up against him .
NIRV	Daniel	11	16	He will do anything he wants to . No one will be able to stand up against him . He will take over the beautiful land of Israel . And he will have the power to destroy it .
NIRV	Daniel	11	17	The king of Syria will decide to come with the might of his entire kingdom . He will join forces with the king of Egypt . And the king of Syria will give his daughter to him to become his wife . The king of Syria will do this in order to take control of Egypt . But his plans will not succeed or help him .
NIRV	Daniel	11	18	Then he will turn his attention to the lands along the Mediterranean coast . He will take over many of them . But a commander will put an end to his proud actions . He will turn his pride back on him .
NIRV	Daniel	11	19	After this , the king of Syria will return to the forts in his own country . But he will trip and fall . And he will never be seen again .
NIRV	Daniel	11	20	“ The next king after him will send someone out to collect taxes . The taxes will help maintain the glory of his kingdom . But in a few years the king will be destroyed . It will not happen because someone becomes angry with him or kills him in battle .
NIRV	Daniel	11	21	“ After him , another king will take his place . Many people will hate him . He will not be honored as a king should be . He will lead an army into the kingdom when its people feel secure . He will make clever plans to capture it .
NIRV	Daniel	11	22	Then he will sweep away a huge army . The army and a prince of the covenant will be destroyed .
NIRV	Daniel	11	23	The king of Syria will make an agreement with that prince . But then the king of Syria will not keep his word . He will rise to even greater power with the help of only a few people .
NIRV	Daniel	11	24	When the people in the richest areas feel secure , he will attack them . He will do what the kings before him could not do . And he will reward his followers with the goods and wealth he takes . He will make clever plans to take over the forts . But that will last for only a short time .
NIRV	Daniel	11	25	“ He will become stronger and more confident . He will do that by gathering a large army . Then he will go to war against the next king of Egypt . That king will fight against him with a huge and very powerful army . But the king of Egypt will not be able to stand up against him . So the plans of the king of Syria will succeed .
NIRV	Daniel	11	26	The trusted advisers of the king of Egypt will try to destroy him . His army will be swept away . Many of his soldiers will be wounded or killed .
NIRV	Daniel	11	27	The kings of Syria and Egypt will sit at the same table . But in their hearts they will plan to do what is evil . And they will tell lies to each other . But it will not do them any good . God will put an end to their plans at his appointed time .
NIRV	Daniel	11	28	The king of Syria will return to his own country . He will go back there with great wealth . But he will make evil plans against the holy temple in Jerusalem . He will do a lot of harm to the temple and the people who worship there . Then he will return to his own country .
NIRV	Daniel	11	29	“ At God ’ s appointed time , the king of Syria will march south again . But this time things will turn out differently .
NIRV	Daniel	11	30	Roman ships will oppose him . He will lose hope . Then he will turn back . He will take out his anger against the holy temple . And he will do good to the Jews who desert it .
NIRV	Daniel	11	31	“ His army will come and make the temple area ‘ unclean. ’ They will put a stop to the daily sacrifices . Then they will set up a hated thing that destroys .
NIRV	Daniel	11	32	He will pretend to praise those who have broken the covenant . He will lead them to do what is evil . But the people who know their God will firmly oppose him .
NIRV	Daniel	11	33	“ Those who are wise will teach many others . But for a while , some of the wise will be killed by swords . Others will be burned to death . Still others will be made prisoners . Or they will be robbed of everything they have .
NIRV	Daniel	11	34	When that happens , they will receive a little help . Many who are not honest will join them .
NIRV	Daniel	11	35	So some of the wise people will suffer . They will be made pure in the fire . They will be made spotless until the time of the end . It will still come at God ’ s appointed time . The King Who Honors Himself
NIRV	Daniel	11	36	“ A certain king will do as he pleases . He will honor himself . He will put himself above every god . He will say things against the greatest God of all . Those things have never been heard before . He will have success until God is not angry anymore . What God has decided to do must take place .
NIRV	Daniel	11	37	The king will not show any respect for the gods his people have always worshiped . There is a god desired by women . He will not respect that god either . He will not have respect for any god . Instead , he will put himself above all of them .
NIRV	Daniel	11	38	In place of them , he will worship a god of war . He will honor a god his people have not known before . He will give gold and silver to that god . He will bring jewels and expensive gifts to it .
NIRV	Daniel	11	39	He will attack the strongest forts . A new god will help him do it . He will greatly honor those who recognize him as their leader . He will make them rulers over many people . And he will give them land as a reward .
NIRV	Daniel	11	40	“ A king in the south will go to war against him . It will happen at the time of the end . The king who will honor himself will rush out against him . He will come with chariots and horsemen . He will attack with a lot of ships . He will lead his army into many countries . He will sweep through them like a flood .
NIRV	Daniel	11	41	He will also march into the beautiful land of Israel . Many countries will fall . But Edom , Moab and the leaders of Ammon will be saved from his mighty hand .
NIRV	Daniel	11	42	His power will reach out into many countries . Even Egypt will not escape .
NIRV	Daniel	11	43	He will gain control of all Egypt ’ s riches . He will take their gold and silver treasures . The people of Libya and Cush will be under his control .
NIRV	Daniel	11	44	But reports from the east and the north will terrify him . He will march out with great anger to destroy many people and wipe them out .
NIRV	Daniel	11	45	He will set up his royal tents . He will put them between the Mediterranean Sea and the beautiful holy mountain of Zion . But his end will come . And no one will help him . Copyright ©

NIRV	Daniel	12	12	Blessed are those who wait for the 1,335 days and reach the end of them .
NIRV	Daniel	12	2	Many people who lie dead in their graves will wake up . Some will rise up to life that will never end . Others will rise up to shame that will never end .
NIRV	Daniel	12	3	Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the sky . Those who lead many others to do what is right will be like the stars for ever and ever .
NIRV	Daniel	12	4	But I want you to roll up this scroll , Daniel . Seal it until the time of the end . Many people will go here and there to increase their knowledge. ”
NIRV	Daniel	12	5	Then I looked up and saw two other angels . One was on this side of the Tigris River . And one was on the other side .
NIRV	Daniel	12	6	The man who was dressed in linen was above the waters of the river . One of the angels spoke to him . He asked , “ How long will it be before these amazing things come true ? ”
NIRV	Daniel	12	7	The man raised both hands toward heaven . I heard him make a promise in the name of the God who lives forever . He answered me , “ Three and a half years . Then the power of the holy people will finally be broken . And all these things will come true. ”
NIRV	Daniel	12	8	I heard what he said . But I didn ’ t understand it . So I asked , “ My master , what will come of all this ? ”
NIRV	Daniel	12	9	He answered , “ Go on your way , Daniel . The scroll is rolled up . It is sealed until the time of the end .
NIRV	Daniel	12	10	Many people will be made pure in the fire . They will be made spotless . But sinful people will continue to be evil . Not one sinful person will understand . But those who are wise will .
NIRV	Daniel	12	11	“ The daily sacrifices will be stopped . And the hated thing that destroys will be set up . After that , there will be 1,290 days .
NIRV	Daniel	12	13	“ Daniel , go on your way until the end . Your body will rest in the grave . Then at the end of the days you will rise from the dead . And you will receive what God has appointed for you. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Hosea	1	1	A message from the Lord came to Hosea , the son of Beeri . The message came while Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz and Hezekiah were kings of Judah . It also came while Jeroboam was king of Israel . He was the son of Jehoash . Here is what the Lord said to him . Hosea ’ s Wife and Children
NIRV	Hosea	1	2	The Lord began to speak through Hosea . He said to him , “ Go . Marry a woman who has sex with anyone she wants . Have children with her . Do this because the people of the land are like that kind of wife . They have not been faithful to me. ”
NIRV	Hosea	1	3	So Hosea married Gomer . She was the daughter of Diblaim . Gomer became pregnant and had a son by Hosea .
NIRV	Hosea	1	4	Then the Lord said to Hosea , “ Name him Jezreel . That ’ s because I will soon punish Jehu ’ s royal family . He killed many people at the city of Jezreel . So I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel .
NIRV	Hosea	1	5	At that time I will break their military power . It will happen in the Valley of Jezreel. ”
NIRV	Hosea	1	6	Gomer became pregnant again . She had a daughter . Then the Lord said to Hosea , “ Name her Lo-Ruhamah. ” Lo-Ruhamah means Not Loved . “ That ’ s because I will no longer show love to the people of Israel . I will not forgive them anymore .
NIRV	Hosea	1	7	But I will show love to the people of Judah . And I will save them . I will not use bows or swords or other weapons of war to do it . I will not save them by using horses and horsemen either . Instead , I will use my own power to save them . I am the Lord their God . And I will save them. ”
NIRV	Hosea	1	8	Later , Gomer stopped nursing Lo-Ruhamah . After that , she had another son .
NIRV	Hosea	1	9	Then the Lord said , “ Name him Lo-Ammi. ” Lo-Ammi means Not My People . “ That ’ s because Israel is no longer my people . And I am no longer their God .
NIRV	Hosea	1	10	“ But the time will come when the people of Israel will be like the sand on the seashore . It can ’ t be measured or counted . Now it is said about them , ‘ You are not my people. ’ But at that time they will be called ‘ children of the living God. ’
NIRV	Hosea	1	11	The people of Judah and Israel will come together again . They will appoint one leader and come up out of the land . And Jezreel ’ s day will be great . Copyright ©

NIRV	Hosea	2	2	“ Tell your mother she is wrong . Tell her she is wrong . She isn ’ t acting like a wife to me anymore . She no longer treats me as her husband . Tell her to stop looking and acting like a prostitute . Tell her not to let her lovers lie on her breasts anymore .
NIRV	Hosea	2	3	If she doesn ’ t stop it , I will strip her naked . I ’ ll make her as bare as she was on the day she was born . I ’ ll make her like a desert . She will become like dry land . And I ’ ll let her die of thirst .
NIRV	Hosea	2	4	“ I won ’ t show my love to her children . They are the children of other men .
NIRV	Hosea	2	5	Their mother hasn ’ t been faithful to me . She who became pregnant with them has brought shame on herself . She said , ‘ I will chase after my lovers . They give me my food and water . They provide me with wool and linen . They give me olive oil and wine. ’
NIRV	Hosea	2	6	So I will block her path with bushes that have thorns . I ’ ll build a wall around her . Then she can ’ t go to her lovers .
NIRV	Hosea	2	7	She will still chase after her lovers . But she won ’ t catch them . She ’ ll look for them . But she won ’ t find them . Then she ’ ll say , ‘ I ’ ll go back to my husband . That ’ s where I was at first . I was better off then than I am now. ’
NIRV	Hosea	2	8	She wouldn ’ t admit that I was the one who gave her everything she had . I provided her with grain , olive oil and fresh wine . I gave her plenty of silver and gold . But she used it to make statues of Baal .
NIRV	Hosea	2	9	“ So I will take away my grain when it gets ripe . I ’ ll take my fresh wine when it ’ s ready . I ’ ll take back my wool and my linen . I gave them to her to cover her naked body .
NIRV	Hosea	2	10	So now I ’ ll uncover her body . All her lovers will see it . No one can stop me from punishing her .
NIRV	Hosea	2	11	I will put a stop to the special times she celebrates . I ’ ll bring an end to the feasts she celebrates each year . I ’ ll stop her New Moon feasts and her Sabbath days . I ’ ll bring all her appointed feasts to an end .
NIRV	Hosea	2	12	I will destroy her vines and her fig trees . She said they were her pay from her lovers . I ’ ll make them like clumps of bushes and weeds . Wild animals will eat them up .
NIRV	Hosea	2	13	Israel burned incense to the gods that were named Baal . I will punish her for all the times she did that . She decorated herself with rings and jewelry . Then she went after her lovers . But she forgot all about me , ” declares the Lord .
NIRV	Hosea	2	14	“ So now I am going to draw her back to me . I will lead her into the desert . There I will speak tenderly to her .
NIRV	Hosea	2	15	I will give her back her vineyards . I will make the Valley of Achor a door of hope for her . Then she will love me , as she did when she was young . She will love me just as she did when she came up out of Egypt .
NIRV	Hosea	2	16	“ A new day is coming , ” announces the Lord . “ Israel will call me ‘ my husband. ’ She will no longer call me ‘ my master. ’
NIRV	Hosea	2	17	She will no longer speak about the gods that are named Baal . She will not pray to them for help anymore .
NIRV	Hosea	2	18	At that time I will make a covenant for the good of my people . I will make it with the wild animals and the birds in the sky . It will also be made with the creatures that move along the ground . I will remove bows and swords and other weapons of war from the land . Then my people can lie down in safety .
NIRV	Hosea	2	19	I will make Israel my own . She will belong to me forever . I will do to her what is right and fair . I will love her tenderly .
NIRV	Hosea	2	20	I will be faithful to her . And she will recognize me as the Lord .
NIRV	Hosea	2	21	“ So at that time I will answer her , ” announces the Lord . “ I will command the skies to send rain on the earth .
NIRV	Hosea	2	22	Then the earth will produce grain , olive oil and fresh wine . And Israel will be called Jezreel . That ’ s because I will answer her prayers .
NIRV	Hosea	2	23	I will plant her in the land for myself . I will show my love to the one I called Not My Loved One . I will say , ‘ You are my people ’ to those who were called Not My People . And they will say , ‘ You are my God. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Hosea	3	3	Then I told her , “ You must wait for me for a long time . You must not be a prostitute . You must not have sex with any man . And I will be faithful to you too. ”
NIRV	Hosea	3	2	So I bought Gomer for six ounces of silver and
NIRV	Hosea	3	430	pounds of barley .
NIRV	Hosea	3	4	So the people of Israel will live for a long time without a king or prince . They won ’ t have sacrifices or sacred stones . They won ’ t have sacred linen aprons or statues of family gods .
NIRV	Hosea	3	5	After that , the people of Israel will return to the Lord their God . They will look to him and to a king from the family line of David . In the last days , they will tremble with fear as they come to the Lord . And they will receive his full blessing . Copyright ©

NIRV	Hosea	4	4	“ But you priests should not blame the people . You should not find fault with one another . After all , your people could also bring charges against you .
NIRV	Hosea	4	2	People curse one another . They tell lies and commit murder . They steal and commit adultery . They break all my laws . They keep spilling the blood of other people .
NIRV	Hosea	4	3	That is why the land is drying up . All those who live in it are getting weaker and weaker . The wild animals and the birds in the sky are dying . So are the fish in the ocean .
NIRV	Hosea	4	5	You trip and fall day and night . And the prophets fall down along with you . So I will destroy your nation . She is the one who gave birth to you .
NIRV	Hosea	4	6	My people are destroyed because they do not know me . “ You priests have refused to obey me . So I will refuse to accept you as my priests . You have not paid any attention to my law . So I will not let your children be my priests .
NIRV	Hosea	4	7	The more priests there were , the more they sinned against me . They have traded their glorious God for that shameful god named Baal .
NIRV	Hosea	4	8	They live off the sins of my people . And they want them to keep on sinning .
NIRV	Hosea	4	9	So here is what I will do . I will punish people and priests alike . I will judge them because of their sinful lives . I will pay them back for the evil things they have done .
NIRV	Hosea	4	10	“ My people will eat . But they will not have enough . They will have sex with prostitutes . But they will not have any children . That ’ s because they have deserted me . They have sex
NIRV	Hosea	4	11	with prostitutes . They drink old wine and fresh wine . Their drinking has destroyed their ability to understand .
NIRV	Hosea	4	12	My people ask a wooden statue of a god for advice . They get answers from a stick of wood . They are as unfaithful as prostitutes . They are not faithful to their God .
NIRV	Hosea	4	13	They offer sacrifices on the mountaintops . They burn offerings on the hills . They worship under oak , poplar and terebinth trees . The trees provide plenty of shade . So your daughters become prostitutes . And your daughters-in-law commit adultery .
NIRV	Hosea	4	14	“ I will not punish your daughters when they become prostitutes . I will not judge your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery . After all , the men themselves have sex with sinful women . They offer sacrifices where temple prostitutes earn their living . People who can ’ t understand will be destroyed !
NIRV	Hosea	4	15	“ Israel , you are not faithful to me . But I do not want Judah to become guilty too . “ My people , do not go to Gilgal to offer sacrifices . Do not go up to Bethel to worship other gods . When you make a promise , do not say , ‘ You can be sure that the Lord is alive. ’
NIRV	Hosea	4	16	The people of Israel are stubborn . They are as stubborn as a young cow . So how can I take care of them like lambs in a meadow ?
NIRV	Hosea	4	17	The people of Ephraim have joined themselves to other gods . And nothing can be done to help them .
NIRV	Hosea	4	18	They continue to be unfaithful to me even when their drinks are gone . And their rulers love to do shameful things .
NIRV	Hosea	4	19	A windstorm will blow all of them away . And their sacrifices will bring shame on them . Copyright ©

NIRV	Hosea	5	5	Israel ’ s pride proves that they are guilty . The people of Ephraim trip and fall because they have sinned . Judah falls down along with them .
NIRV	Hosea	5	2	You refuse to obey me . You are knee-deep in killing . So I will punish all of you .
NIRV	Hosea	5	3	I know all about the people of Ephraim . What Israel is doing is not hidden from me . Now they have joined themselves to other gods . They have made themselves ‘ unclean. ’
NIRV	Hosea	5	4	“ They can ’ t return to me because they have done so many evil things . In their hearts they long to act like prostitutes . They do not recognize me as the Lord .
NIRV	Hosea	5	6	Israel will come to worship the Lord . They will bring their animals to offer as sacrifices . But they will not find him . He has turned away from them .
NIRV	Hosea	5	7	They are not faithful to the Lord . Their children are not his . When they celebrate their New Moon feasts , he will destroy their fields .
NIRV	Hosea	5	8	“ My people , blow trumpets in Gibeah ! Blow horns in Ramah ! Shout the battle cry in Bethel ! Say to the people of Benjamin , ‘ Lead on into battle ! ’
NIRV	Hosea	5	9	The people of Ephraim will be completely destroyed when it is time for me to punish them . They can be sure it will happen . I am announcing it among their tribes .
NIRV	Hosea	5	10	Judah ’ s leaders have stolen some land . They have moved their borders farther north . So I will pour out my anger on them like a flood of water .
NIRV	Hosea	5	11	Ephraim will soon be crushed . The Assyrians will stomp all over them . It will happen because they have made up their minds to chase after other gods .
NIRV	Hosea	5	12	I will be like a moth to Ephraim . I will cause Judah to rot away .
NIRV	Hosea	5	13	“ The people of Ephraim saw how sick they were . The people of Judah saw that they were wounded . Then Ephraim turned to Assyria for help . They sent gifts to the great King Tiglath-Pileser . But he is not able to make you well . He can ’ t heal your wounds .
NIRV	Hosea	5	14	I will be like a lion to Ephraim . I will attack Judah like a powerful lion . I will tear them to pieces . I will drag them off . Then I will leave them . No one will be able to save them .
NIRV	Hosea	5	15	I will go back to my lion ’ s den . I will stay there until they pay the price for their sin . Then they will turn to me . They will suffer so much that they will really want me to help them. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Hosea	6	2	After two days he will give us new life . On the third day he ’ ll make us like new again . Then we will enjoy his blessing .
NIRV	Hosea	6	3	Let ’ s recognize him as the Lord . Let ’ s keep trying to know him . You can be sure the sun will rise . And you can be just as sure the Lord will appear . He will come to renew us like the winter rains . He will be like the spring rains that water the earth. ”
NIRV	Hosea	6	4	The Lord says , “ Ephraim , what can I do with you ? And what can I do with you , Judah ? Your love for me vanishes like the morning mist . It soon disappears like the early dew .
NIRV	Hosea	6	5	So I used the words of my prophets to cut you in pieces . I used my words to put you to death . Then my judgments blazed out like the sun .
NIRV	Hosea	6	7	Just as at the city of Adam , they disobeyed me , they have broken the covenant I made with them . They were not faithful to me there .
NIRV	Hosea	6	8	Ramoth Gilead is a city where sinful people live . It is stained with footprints of blood .
NIRV	Hosea	6	9	On the road to Shechem , groups of priests act like robbers . They hide and wait to attack people . They murder them . So they carry out their evil plans .
NIRV	Hosea	6	10	I have seen a horrible thing in Israel . The people of Ephraim are unfaithful to their own God . The people of Israel are ‘ unclean. ’

NIRV	Hosea	7	7	All of them are as hot as an oven . They destroy their rulers . All their kings fall from power . But none of them calls on the Lord for help .
NIRV	Hosea	7	2	But they do not realize that I remember all the evil things they do . Their sins pile up and cover them . I am always aware of their sins .
NIRV	Hosea	7	3	“ Their evil conduct even makes the king glad . Their lies make the princes happy .
NIRV	Hosea	7	4	But all the people are unfaithful to the king . Their anger against him burns like the coals in an oven . The baker does not even need to stir up the fire until the dough is ready. ”
NIRV	Hosea	7	5	On special days to honor our king , the princes get drunk with wine . And the king enjoys the party . He joins hands with those who pretend to be faithful to him .
NIRV	Hosea	7	6	Their hearts are as hot as an oven . They make evil plans to get rid of him . Their anger burns like a slow fire all night . In the morning it blazes out like a flaming fire .
NIRV	Hosea	7	8	The people of Ephraim mix with the nations . They are like a thin loaf of bread that is baked on only one side .
NIRV	Hosea	7	9	People from other lands make them weaker and weaker . But they don ’ t realize it . Their hair is becoming gray . But they don ’ t even notice it .
NIRV	Hosea	7	10	The pride of Israel proves that they are guilty . But in spite of everything , they don ’ t return to the Lord their God . They don ’ t go to him for help .
NIRV	Hosea	7	11	The Lord says , “ The people of Ephraim are like a dove . They are easily tricked . They do not have any sense at all . First they call out to Egypt for help . Then they turn to Assyria .
NIRV	Hosea	7	12	When they send for help , I will throw my net over them . I will capture them like the birds in the sky . When I hear them gathering like birds , I will catch them .
NIRV	Hosea	7	13	How terrible it will be for them ! They have wandered away from me . So they will be destroyed . That ’ s because they have refused to obey me . I long to save them . But they tell lies about me .
NIRV	Hosea	7	14	They do not cry out to me from their hearts . Instead , they just lie on their beds and sob . They cut themselves when they pray to their gods for grain and fresh wine . But they turn away from me .
NIRV	Hosea	7	15	I brought them up and made them strong . But they make evil plans against me .
NIRV	Hosea	7	16	I am the Most High God . But they do not turn to me . They are like a bow that does not shoot straight . Their leaders will be killed by swords . They will die because they have spoken too proudly . The people of Egypt will make fun of them. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Hosea	8	8	So the people of Israel are swallowed up . Now they are among the nations like something no one wants .
NIRV	Hosea	8	2	Israel shouts to me , ‘ We recognize you as our God ! ’
NIRV	Hosea	8	3	But they have turned away from what is good . So an enemy will chase them .
NIRV	Hosea	8	4	My people appoint kings I do not want . They choose princes without my permission . They use their silver and gold to make statues of gods . That is how they destroy themselves. ”
NIRV	Hosea	8	5	The Lord says , “ People of Samaria , throw out your god that looks like a calf ! I am very angry with them . How long will it be until they are able to remain faithful to me ?
NIRV	Hosea	8	6	Their calf is not God . A skilled worker from Israel made it . But that calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces. ”
NIRV	Hosea	8	7	The Lord says , “ Worshiping other gods is like worshiping the wind . It is like planting worthless seeds . Assyria is like a windstorm . That is all my people will harvest . There are no heads of grain on the stems that will come up . So they will not produce any flour . Even if they did produce grain , the Assyrians would eat all of it up .
NIRV	Hosea	8	9	They have gone up to Assyria for help . They are like a wild donkey that wanders around by itself . Ephraim ’ s people have sold themselves to their Assyrian lovers .
NIRV	Hosea	8	10	They have sold themselves to the nations to get their help . But now I will gather them together . They will get weaker and weaker . The mighty kings of Assyria will crush them .
NIRV	Hosea	8	11	“ Ephraim built many altars where they sacrificed sin offerings to other gods . So their altars have become places where they commit sin .
NIRV	Hosea	8	12	In my law I wrote down many things for their good . But they considered those things as something strange .
NIRV	Hosea	8	13	They offer sacrifices as gifts to me . They eat the meat of the animals they bring . But the Lord is not pleased with any of this . He will remember the evil things they have done . He will punish them for their sins . And they will return to Egypt .
NIRV	Hosea	8	14	Israel has forgotten the God who made them . They have built palaces for themselves . Judah has built forts in many towns . But I will send down fire on their cities . It will burn up their forts. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Hosea	9	9	You have sunk very deep into sin , just as your people did at Gibeah long ago . God will remember the evil things they have done . He will punish them for their sins .
NIRV	Hosea	9	2	But soon there won ’ t be any grain or wine to feed you . There won ’ t even be any fresh wine .
NIRV	Hosea	9	3	You won ’ t remain in the Lord ’ s land . Ephraim , you will return to Egypt . You will eat “ unclean ” food in Assyria .
NIRV	Hosea	9	4	You won ’ t pour out wine offerings to the Lord . Your sacrifices won ’ t please him . They ’ ll be like the bread people eat when someone dies . Everyone who eats those sacrifices will be “ unclean. ” They themselves will have to eat that kind of food . They can ’ t bring it into the Lord ’ s temple .
NIRV	Hosea	9	5	What will you do when your appointed feasts come ? What will you do on the Lord ’ s special days ?
NIRV	Hosea	9	6	Some of you will escape without being destroyed . But you will die in Egypt . Your bodies will be buried at Memphis . Weeds will cover your treasures of silver . Thorns will grow up in your tents .
NIRV	Hosea	9	7	The time when God will punish you is coming . The day when he will judge you is near . I want Israel to know this . You have committed many sins . And you hate me very much . That ’ s why you think the prophet is foolish . You think the person the Lord speaks through is crazy .
NIRV	Hosea	9	8	People of Ephraim , the prophet , along with my God , is warning you of danger . But you set traps for him everywhere he goes . You hate him so much you even wait for him in God ’ s house .
NIRV	Hosea	9	10	The Lord says , “ When I first found Israel , it was like finding grapes in the desert . When I saw your people of long ago , it was like seeing the early fruit on a fig tree . But then they went to Baal Peor . There they gave themselves to that shameful god named Baal . They became as evil as the god they loved .
NIRV	Hosea	9	11	Ephraim ’ s greatness and glory will be gone . It will fly away like a bird . Women will no longer have children . They will not be able to get pregnant .
NIRV	Hosea	9	12	But suppose they do have children . Then I will kill every one of them . How terrible it will be for them when I turn away from them !
NIRV	Hosea	9	13	Tyre is planted in a pleasant place . And so is Ephraim . But the Assyrians will kill Ephraim ’ s children. ”
NIRV	Hosea	9	14	Lord , what should you do to Ephraim ’ s people ? Give them women whose babies die before they are born . Give them women whose breasts have no milk .
NIRV	Hosea	9	15	The Lord says , “ My people did many evil things in Gilgal . That is why I hated them there . They committed many sins . So I will drive them out of my land . I will not love them anymore . All their leaders refuse to obey me .
NIRV	Hosea	9	16	Ephraim is like a worthless plant . Its roots are dried up . It does not produce any fruit . Suppose Ephraim ’ s people have children . Then I will kill the children they love so much. ”

NIRV	Hosea	10	2	Their hearts are dishonest . So now they must pay for their sins . The Lord will tear down their altars . He ’ ll destroy their sacred stones .
NIRV	Hosea	10	3	Then they ’ ll say , “ We don ’ t have a king . That ’ s because we didn ’ t have any respect for the Lord . But suppose we did have a king . What could he do for us ? ”
NIRV	Hosea	10	4	They make a lot of promises . They make agreements among themselves . They make promises they don ’ t mean to keep . So court cases spring up like poisonous weeds in a plowed field .
NIRV	Hosea	10	5	The people who live in Samaria are filled with fear . They are afraid for their god that looks like a calf . They ’ re afraid it will be carried off from Beth Aven , that evil town . They will mourn over it . So will the priests who led them to worship it . The priests were full of joy because their statue was so glorious . But it will be captured and taken far away from them .
NIRV	Hosea	10	6	It will be carried off to Assyria . The people of Ephraim will be forced to give it to the great king . They will be dishonored . Israel will be ashamed of its agreements with other nations .
NIRV	Hosea	10	7	Samaria ’ s king will be destroyed . He will be like a twig swept away by a river .
NIRV	Hosea	10	8	The high places where Israel worshiped other gods will be destroyed . That ’ s where they sinned against the Lord . Thorns and weeds will grow up there . They will cover the altars . Then the people will say to the mountains , “ Cover us ! ” They ’ ll say to the hills , “ Fall on us ! ”
NIRV	Hosea	10	9	The Lord says , “ Israel , you have done evil things ever since your people sinned at Gibeah long ago . And you are still doing what is evil . War will come again to those who sinned at Gibeah .
NIRV	Hosea	10	11	Ephraim was like a well-trained young cow . It loved to thresh grain . So I will put a yoke on its pretty neck . I will make Ephraim do hard work . Judah also must plow . So all the people of Jacob must break up the ground .
NIRV	Hosea	10	12	Your hearts are as hard as a field that has not been plowed . If you change your ways , you will produce good crops . So plant the seeds of doing what is right . Then you will harvest the fruit of your faithful love . It is time to seek the Lord . When you do , he will come and shower his blessings on you .
NIRV	Hosea	10	13	But you have planted the seeds of doing what is wrong . So you have harvested the fruit of your evil conduct . You have had to eat the fruit of your lies . You have trusted in your own strength . You have depended on your many soldiers .
NIRV	Hosea	10	14	But the roar of battle will come against you . All your forts will be completely destroyed . It will happen just as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in a battle . Mothers and their children were smashed on the ground .

NIRV	Hosea	11	2	But the more I called out to Israel , the more they went away from me . They brought sacrifices to the statues of the gods that were named Baal . And they burned incense to them .
NIRV	Hosea	11	3	I taught Ephraim to walk . I took them up in my arms . But they did not realize I was the one who took care of them .

NIRV	Hosea	12	3	Even before Jacob was born , he was holding on to his brother ’ s heel . When he became a man , he struggled with God .
NIRV	Hosea	12	4	At Peniel he struggled with the angel and won . Jacob wept and begged for his blessing . God also met with him at Bethel . He talked with him there .
NIRV	Hosea	12	5	He is the Lord God who rules over all . His name is the Lord .

NIRV	Hosea	12	13	The prophet Moses brought Israel up from Egypt . The Lord used him to take care of them .

NIRV	Hosea	13	2	Now they sin more and more . They use their silver to make statues of gods for themselves . The statues come from their own clever ideas . Skilled workers make all of them . The people pray to these gods . They offer human sacrifices to them . They kiss the gods that look like calves .

NIRV	Hosea	13	7	So I will leap on them like a lion . I will hide and wait beside the road like a leopard .
NIRV	Hosea	13	8	I will attack them like a bear that is robbed of her cubs . I will rip them wide open . Like a lion I will eat them up . Like a wild animal I will tear them apart .
NIRV	Hosea	13	9	“ Israel , you will be destroyed . I helped you . But you turned against me .
NIRV	Hosea	13	10	Where is your king ? Wasn ’ t he supposed to save you ? Where are the rulers in all your towns ? You said , ‘ Give us a king and princes. ’
NIRV	Hosea	13	11	So I became angry and gave you a king . Then I took him away from you .
NIRV	Hosea	13	12	Ephraim ’ s guilt is piling up . I am keeping a record of all their sins .
NIRV	Hosea	13	14	“ I will set these people free from the power of the grave . I will save them from death . Death , where are your plagues ? Grave , where is your power to destroy ? “ I will no longer pity Ephraim .
NIRV	Hosea	13	15	Even though they are doing well among the other tribes , trouble will come to them . I will send a hot and dry wind from the east . It will blow in from the desert . Their springs will not have any water . Their wells will dry up . All their treasures will be taken out of their storerooms .
NIRV	Hosea	13	16	The people of Samaria must pay for their sins . They have refused to obey me . They will be killed by swords . Their little children will be smashed on the ground . Their pregnant women will be ripped wide open. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Hosea	14	14	Israel , return to the Lord your God . Your sins have destroyed you !
NIRV	Hosea	14	2	Tell the Lord you are turning away from your sins . Return to him . Say to him , “ Forgive us for all our sins . Please be kind to us . Welcome us back to you . Then our lips will offer you our praise .
NIRV	Hosea	14	3	Assyria can ’ t save us . We won ’ t trust in our war horses . Our own hands have made statues of gods . But we will never call them our gods again . We are like children whose fathers have died . But you show us your tender love. ”
NIRV	Hosea	14	4	Then the Lord will answer , “ My people always wander away from me . But I will put an end to that . My anger has turned away from them . Now I will love them freely .
NIRV	Hosea	14	5	I will be like the dew to Israel . They will bloom like a lily . They will send their roots down deep like a cedar tree in Lebanon .

NIRV	Joel	1	1	A message from the Lord came to Joel , the son of Pethuel . Here is what Joel said . Locusts Attack the Land
NIRV	Joel	1	2	Elders , listen to me . Pay attention , all you who live in the land . Has anything like this ever happened in your whole life ? Did it ever happen to your people who lived long ago ?
NIRV	Joel	1	3	Tell your children about it . Let them tell their children . And let their children tell it to those who live after them .
NIRV	Joel	1	4	The giant locusts have eaten what the common locusts have left . The young locusts have eaten what the giant locusts have left . And other locusts have eaten what the young locusts have left .
NIRV	Joel	1	5	Get up and weep , you people who drink too much ! Cry , all you who drink wine ! Cry because the fresh wine has been taken away from you .
NIRV	Joel	1	6	The locusts are like a mighty army that has marched into our land . There are so many of them they can ’ t even be counted . Their teeth are as sharp as a lion ’ s teeth . They are like the fangs of a female lion .
NIRV	Joel	1	7	The locusts have completely destroyed our vines . They have wiped out our fig trees . They ’ ve stripped off the bark and thrown it away . They ’ ve left the branches bare .
NIRV	Joel	1	8	My people , mourn like a virgin who is dressed in the clothes of sadness . She is sad because she has lost the young man she was going to marry .
NIRV	Joel	1	9	No one brings grain offerings and drink offerings to the Lord ’ s house anymore . So the priests who serve the Lord are filled with sorrow .
NIRV	Joel	1	10	Our fields are wiped out . The ground is dried up . The grain is destroyed . The fresh wine is gone . And there isn ’ t any more olive oil .
NIRV	Joel	1	11	Farmers , be sad . Cry , you who grow vines . Mourn because the wheat and barley are gone . The crops in the fields are destroyed .
NIRV	Joel	1	12	The vines and fig trees are dried up . The pomegranate , palm and apple trees don ’ t have any fruit on them . In fact , all the trees in the fields are dried up . And my people ’ s joy has faded away . A Call to Mourn
NIRV	Joel	1	13	Priests , put on the clothing of sadness and mourn . Cry , you who serve at the altar . Come , you who serve my God in the temple . Spend the night dressed in the clothes of sadness . Weep because no one brings grain offerings and drink offerings to the house of your God anymore .
NIRV	Joel	1	14	Announce a holy fast . Tell the people not to eat anything . Gather them together for a special service . Send for the elders and all who live in the land . Have them come to the house of the Lord your God . And pray to him .
NIRV	Joel	1	15	The day of the Lord is near . How sad it will be on that day ! The Mighty One is coming to destroy you .
NIRV	Joel	1	16	Our food has been taken away right in front of our eyes . There isn ’ t any joy or gladness in the house of our God .
NIRV	Joel	1	17	The seeds have dried up in the ground . The grain is also gone . The storerooms have been destroyed . The barns are broken down .
NIRV	Joel	1	18	Listen to the cattle groan ! The herds wander around . They don ’ t have any grass to eat . The flocks of sheep are also suffering .
NIRV	Joel	1	19	Lord , I call out to you . Fire has burned up the desert grasslands . Flames have destroyed all the trees in the fields .
NIRV	Joel	1	20	Even the wild animals cry out to you for help . The streams of water have dried up . Fire has burned up the desert grasslands . Copyright ©

NIRV	Joel	2	2	That day will be dark and sad . It will be black and cloudy . A huge army of locusts is coming . They will spread across the mountains like the sun when it rises . There has never been an army like it . And there will never be another for all time to come .
NIRV	Joel	2	3	Like fire they eat up everything in their path . Behind them it looks as if flames have burned the land . In front of them the land is like the Garden of Eden . Behind them it is a dry and empty desert . Nothing escapes them .
NIRV	Joel	2	4	They look like horses . Like war horses they charge ahead .
NIRV	Joel	2	5	They sound like chariots as they leap over the mountaintops . They crackle like fire burning up dry weeds . They are like a mighty army that is ready for battle .
NIRV	Joel	2	6	When people see them , they tremble with fear . All their faces turn pale .
NIRV	Joel	2	7	The locusts charge ahead like warriors . They climb over walls like soldiers . All of them march in line . They don ’ t turn to the right or the left .
NIRV	Joel	2	8	They don ’ t bump into one another . Each of them marches straight ahead . They charge through everything that tries to stop them . But they still stay in line .
NIRV	Joel	2	9	They attack a city . They run along its wall . They climb into houses . They enter through windows like robbers .
NIRV	Joel	2	10	As they march forward , the earth shakes . The heavens tremble as they approach . The sun and moon grow dark . And the stars stop shining .
NIRV	Joel	2	11	The Lord thunders with his mighty voice as he leads his army . He has so many forces they can ’ t even be counted . The army that obeys his commands is mighty . The day of the Lord is great and terrifying . Who can live through it ? Let Your Hearts Be Broken
NIRV	Joel	2	12	The Lord announces to his people , “ Return to me with all your heart . There is still time . Do not eat any food . Weep and mourn. ”
NIRV	Joel	2	13	Don ’ t just tear your clothes to show how sad you are . Let your hearts be broken . Return to the Lord your God . He is gracious . He is tender and kind . He is slow to get angry . He is full of love . He won ’ t bring his judgment . He won ’ t destroy you .
NIRV	Joel	2	14	Who knows ? He might turn toward you and not bring his judgment . He might even give you his blessing . Then you can bring grain offerings and drink offerings to the Lord your God .
NIRV	Joel	2	15	Priests , blow the trumpets in Zion . Announce a holy fast . Tell the people not to eat anything . Gather them together for a special service .
NIRV	Joel	2	16	Bring them together . Set all of them apart to me . Bring together the elders . Gather the children and the babies who are still nursing . Let the groom leave his bedroom . Let the bride leave their marriage bed .
NIRV	Joel	2	17	Let the priests who serve the Lord weep . Let them cry between the temple porch and the altar . Let them say , “ Lord , spare your people . Don ’ t let others make fun of them . Don ’ t let the nations laugh at them . Don ’ t let them tease your people and say , ‘ Where is their God ? ’ ” The Lord Answers the Prayer of His People
NIRV	Joel	2	18	Then the Lord was concerned for his land . He took pity on his people .
NIRV	Joel	2	19	He replied , “ I am sending you grain , olive oil and fresh wine . It will be enough to satisfy you completely . I will never allow other nations to make fun of you again .
NIRV	Joel	2	20	“ I will drive far away from you the army that comes from the north . I will send some of its forces into a dry and empty land . Its eastern troops will drown in the Dead Sea . Its western troops will drown in the Mediterranean Sea . Their dead bodies will stink. ” The Lord has done great things .
NIRV	Joel	2	21	Land of Judah , don ’ t be afraid . Be glad and full of joy . The Lord has done great things .
NIRV	Joel	2	22	Wild animals , don ’ t be afraid . The desert grasslands are turning green again . The trees are bearing their fruit . The vines and fig trees are producing rich crops .
NIRV	Joel	2	23	People of Zion , be glad . Be joyful because of what the Lord your God has done . He has given you the right amount of rain in the fall . That ’ s because he is faithful . He has sent you plenty of showers . He has sent fall and spring rains alike , just as he did before .
NIRV	Joel	2	24	Your threshing floors will be covered with grain . Olive oil and fresh wine will spill over from the places where they are stored .
NIRV	Joel	2	25	The Lord says , “ I sent a great army of locusts to attack you . They included common locusts , giant locusts , young locusts and other locusts . I will make up for the years they ate your crops .
NIRV	Joel	2	26	You will have plenty to eat . It will satisfy you completely . Then you will praise me . I am the Lord your God . I have done wonderful things for you . My people will never again be put to shame .
NIRV	Joel	2	27	You will know that I am with you in Israel . I am the Lord your God . There is no other God . So my people will never again be put to shame . The Day of the Lord Is Coming
NIRV	Joel	2	28	“ After that , I will pour out my Spirit on all people . Your sons and daughters will prophesy . Your old men will have dreams . Your young men will have visions .
NIRV	Joel	2	29	In those days I will pour out my Spirit on those who serve me , men and women alike .
NIRV	Joel	2	30	I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth . There will be blood and fire and clouds of smoke .
NIRV	Joel	2	31	The sun will become dark . The moon will turn red like blood . It will happen before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes .
NIRV	Joel	2	32	Everyone who calls out to me will be saved . On Mount Zion and in Jerusalem some of my people will be left alive . I have chosen them . That is what I have promised . Copyright ©

NIRV	Joel	3	3	They cast lots for my people . They sold boys into slavery to get prostitutes . They sold girls to buy some wine to drink .
NIRV	Joel	3	2	I will gather together all the nations . I will bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat . There I will put them on trial . I will judge them for what they have done to my people Israel . They scattered them among the nations . They divided up my land among themselves .
NIRV	Joel	3	4	“ Tyre and Sidon , why are you doing things like that to me ? And why are you doing them , all you people in Philistia ? Are you trying to get even with me for something I have done ? If you are , I will pay you back for it in a quick and speedy way .
NIRV	Joel	3	5	You took my silver and gold . You carried off my finest treasures to your temples .
NIRV	Joel	3	6	You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks . You wanted to send them far away from their own country .
NIRV	Joel	3	7	“ But now I will stir them up into action . I will bring them back from the places you sold them to . And I will do to you what you did to them .
NIRV	Joel	3	8	I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah . And they will sell them to the Sabeans . The Sabeans are a nation that is far away. ” The Lord has spoken .
NIRV	Joel	3	9	Announce this among the nations . Tell them to prepare for battle . Nations , get your soldiers ready ! Bring all your fighting men together and march out to attack .
NIRV	Joel	3	10	Hammer your plows into swords . Hammer your pruning tools into spears . Let anyone who is weak say , “ I am strong ! ”
NIRV	Joel	3	11	Come quickly , all you surrounding nations . Gather together in the Valley of Jehoshaphat . Lord , send down your soldiers from heaven !
NIRV	Joel	3	12	The Lord says , “ Stir up the nations into action ! Let them march into the valley where I will judge them . I will take my seat in court . I will judge all the surrounding nations .
NIRV	Joel	3	13	My soldiers , swing your blades . The nations are ripe for harvest . Come and stomp on them as if they were grapes . Crush them until the winepress of my anger is full . Do it until the wine spills over from the places where it is stored . The nations have committed far too many sins ! ”
NIRV	Joel	3	14	Huge numbers of soldiers are gathered in the valley where the Lord will hand down his sentence . The day of the Lord is near in that valley .
NIRV	Joel	3	15	The sun and moon will become dark . The stars won ’ t shine anymore .
NIRV	Joel	3	16	The Lord will roar like a lion from Jerusalem . His voice will sound like thunder from Zion . The earth and the heavens will tremble . But the Lord will keep the people of Israel safe . He will be a place of safety for them . The Lord Blesses His People
NIRV	Joel	3	17	The Lord says , “ You will know that I am the Lord your God . I live in Zion . It is my holy mountain . Jerusalem will be my holy city . People from other lands will never again attack it .
NIRV	Joel	3	18	“ At that time fresh wine will drip from the mountains . Milk will flow down from the hills . Water will run through all Judah ’ s valleys . A fountain will flow out of my temple . It will water the places where acacia trees grow .
NIRV	Joel	3	19	But Egypt will be deserted . Edom will become a dry and empty desert . They did terrible harm to the people of Judah . My people were not guilty of doing anything wrong . But Egypt and Edom spilled their blood anyway .
NIRV	Joel	3	20	My people will live in Judah and Jerusalem forever . The land will be their home for all time to come .
NIRV	Joel	3	21	Egypt and Edom have spilled my people ’ s blood . Should I let them escape my judgment ? No , I will not. ” The Lord lives in Zion ! Copyright ©

NIRV	Amos	5	8	The Lord made the Pleiades and Orion . He turns midnight into sunrise . He makes the day fade into night . He sends for the waters in the clouds . Then he pours them out on the surface of the land . His name is the Lord .
NIRV	Amos	5	9	With a flash of light he destroys places of safety . He tears down cities that have high walls around them .
NIRV	Amos	5	10	There are people among you who hate anyone who stands for justice in court . They hate those who tell the truth .
NIRV	Amos	5	11	You make poor people pay tax on their straw . You also tax their grain . So , even though you have built stone houses , you won ’ t live in them . You have planted fruitful vineyards . But you won ’ t drink the wine they produce .
NIRV	Amos	5	12	I know how many crimes you have committed . You have sinned far too much . Among you are people who crush those who have done no wrong . They accept money from people who want special favors . They take away the rights of poor people in the courts .
NIRV	Amos	5	13	So those who are wise keep quiet in times like these . That ’ s because the times are evil .
NIRV	Amos	5	14	Look to what is good , not to what is evil . Then you will live . And the Lord God who rules over all will be with you , just as you say he is .
NIRV	Amos	5	15	Hate evil and love good . Do what is fair in the courts . Perhaps the Lord God who rules over all will have mercy on you . After all , you are the only ones left in the family line of Joseph .
NIRV	Amos	5	16	The Lord God rules over all . The Lord says , “ People will weep in all the streets . They will be very sad in every market place . Even farmers will be told to cry loudly . People will mourn for the dead .
NIRV	Amos	5	17	Workers will cry in all the vineyards . That ’ s because I will punish you , ” says the Lord . The Day of the Lord Is Coming
NIRV	Amos	5	18	How terrible it will be for you who long for the day of the Lord ! Why do you want it to come ? That day will be dark , not light .
NIRV	Amos	5	19	It will be like a man running away from a lion only to meet a bear . He enters his house and rests his hand on a wall only to be bitten by a snake .
NIRV	Amos	5	20	The day of the Lord will be dark , not light . It will be very black . There won ’ t be a ray of sunlight anywhere .
NIRV	Amos	5	21	The Lord says , “ I hate your holy feasts . I can ’ t stand them . Your gatherings stink .
NIRV	Amos	5	22	You bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings . But I will not accept them . You bring your best friendship offerings . But I will not even look at them .
NIRV	Amos	5	23	Take the noise of your songs away ! I will not listen to the music of your harps .
NIRV	Amos	5	24	I want you to treat others fairly . So let fair treatment roll on just as a river does ! Always do what is right . Let right living flow along like a stream that never runs dry !
NIRV	Amos	5	25	“ People of Israel , did you bring me sacrifices and offerings for
NIRV	Amos	5	40	years in the desert ?
NIRV	Amos	5	26	Yes . But you have honored the place where your king worshiped other gods . You have carried the stands the statues of your gods were on . You have lifted up the banners of the stars you worship as gods . You made all those things for yourselves .
NIRV	Amos	5	27	So I will send you away as prisoners beyond Damascus , ” says the Lord . His name is God Who Rules Over All . Copyright ©

NIRV	Amos	6	6	You drink wine by the bowlful . You use the finest lotions . But Joseph ’ s people will soon be destroyed . And you aren ’ t even sad about it .
NIRV	Amos	6	2	Go and look at the city of Kalneh . Go from there to the great city of Hamath . Then go down to Gath in Philistia . Are those places better off than your two kingdoms ? Is their land larger than yours ?
NIRV	Amos	6	3	You are trying to avoid the time when trouble will come . But you are only bringing closer the Assyrian rule of terror .
NIRV	Amos	6	4	You lie down on beds that are decorated with ivory . You rest on your couches . You eat the best lambs and the fattest calves .
NIRV	Amos	6	5	You pluck away on your harps as David did . You play new songs on musical instruments .
NIRV	Amos	6	7	So you will be among the first to be taken away as prisoners . You won ’ t be able to enjoy good food . You won ’ t lie around on couches anymore . The Lord Hates the Pride of Israel
NIRV	Amos	6	8	The Lord and King has made a promise in his own name . He is the Lord God who rules over all . He announces , “ I hate the pride of Jacob ’ s people . I can ’ t stand their forts . I will hand the city of Samaria and everything in it over to their enemies. ”
NIRV	Amos	6	9	Ten people might be left in one house . If they are , they will die there .
NIRV	Amos	6	10	Relatives might come to burn the dead bodies . If they do , they ’ ll have to carry them out of the house first . They might ask someone still hiding there , “ Is anyone else here with you ? ” If the answer is no , the relatives will go on to say , “ Be quiet ! We must not pray in the Lord ’ s name. ”
NIRV	Amos	6	11	That ’ s because the Lord has already given an order . He will smash large houses to pieces . He will crush small houses to bits .
NIRV	Amos	6	12	Horses don ’ t run on rocky ground . People don ’ t plow the sea with oxen . But you have turned fair treatment into poison . You have turned the fruit of right living into bitterness .
NIRV	Amos	6	13	You are happy because you captured the town of Lo Debar . You say , “ We were strong enough to take Karnaim too. ”
NIRV	Amos	6	14	But the Lord God rules over all . He announces , “ People of Israel , I will stir up a nation against you . They will crush you from Lebo Hamath all the way down to the Arabah Valley. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Amos	7	7	Then the Lord gave me a third vision . He was standing by a wall . It had been built very straight , all the way up and down . He was holding a plumb line .
NIRV	Amos	7	2	The locusts stripped the land clean . Then I cried out , “ Lord and King , forgive Israel ! How can Jacob ’ s people continue ? They are such a weak nation ! ”
NIRV	Amos	7	3	So the Lord had pity on them . “ I will let them continue for now , ” he said .
NIRV	Amos	7	4	The Lord and King gave me a second vision . He was using fire to punish his people . It dried up the deep waters . It burned the land up .
NIRV	Amos	7	5	Then I cried out , “ Lord and King , please stop ! How can Jacob ’ s people continue ? They are such a weak nation ! ”
NIRV	Amos	7	6	So the Lord had pity on them . “ I will let them continue for now , ” the Lord and King said .
NIRV	Amos	7	8	The Lord asked me , “ What do you see , Amos ? ” “ A plumb line , ” I replied . Then the Lord said , “ Look at what I am doing . I am hanging a plumb line next to my people Israel . It will show how crooked they are . I will no longer spare them .
NIRV	Amos	7	9	“ The high places where Isaac ’ s people worship other gods will be destroyed . The other places of worship in Israel will also be torn down . I will use my sword to attack Jeroboam ’ s royal family. ” Amaziah Tells Amos to Stop Prophesying
NIRV	Amos	7	10	Amaziah was priest of Bethel . He sent a message to Jeroboam , the king of Israel . He said , “ Amos is making evil plans against you right here in Israel . The people in the land can ’ t stand to listen to what he ’ s saying .
NIRV	Amos	7	11	Amos is telling them , “ ‘ Jeroboam will be killed by a sword . The people of Israel will be taken away as prisoners . They will be carried off from their own land. ’ ”
NIRV	Amos	7	12	Then Amaziah said to Amos , “ Get out of Israel , you prophet ! Go back to the land of Judah . Earn your living there . Do your prophesying there .
NIRV	Amos	7	13	Don ’ t prophesy here at Bethel anymore . This is where the king worships . The main temple in the kingdom is located here. ”
NIRV	Amos	7	14	Amos answered Amaziah , “ I was not a prophet . I wasn ’ t even the son of a prophet . I was a shepherd . I also took care of sycamore-fig trees .
NIRV	Amos	7	15	But the Lord took me away from taking care of the flock . He said to me , ‘ Go . Prophesy to my people Israel. ’
NIRV	Amos	7	16	Now then , listen to the Lord ’ s message . You say , “ ‘ Don ’ t prophesy against Israel . Stop preaching against the people of Isaac. ’
NIRV	Amos	7	17	“ But the Lord says , “ ‘ Your wife will become a prostitute in the city of Bethel . Your sons and daughters will be killed by swords . Your land will be measured and divided up . And you yourself will die in another country . The people of Israel will surely be taken away as prisoners . They will be carried off from their own land. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Amos	8	2	“ What do you see , Amos ? ” he asked . “ A basket of ripe fruit , ” I replied . Then the Lord said to me , “ The time is ripe for my people Israel . I will no longer spare them .
NIRV	Amos	8	3	“ The time is coming when the songs in the temple will turn to weeping , ” announces the Lord and King . “ Many , many bodies will be thrown everywhere ! So be quiet ! ”
NIRV	Amos	8	4	Listen to me , you who walk all over needy people . You crush those who are poor in the land .
NIRV	Amos	8	5	You say , “ When will the New Moon feast be over ? Then we can sell our grain . When will the Sabbath day come to an end ? Then people can buy our wheat. ” But you measure out less than the right amount . You raise your prices . You cheat others by using dishonest scales .
NIRV	Amos	8	6	You buy poor people to make slaves out of them . You buy those who are in need for a mere pair of sandals . You even sell the worthless parts of your wheat .
NIRV	Amos	8	7	People of Jacob , you are proud that the Lord is your God . But he has made a promise in his own name . He says , “ I will never forget anything Israel has done .
NIRV	Amos	8	9	The Lord and King announces , “ At that time I will make the sun go down at noon . The earth will become dark in the middle of the day .
NIRV	Amos	8	10	I will turn your holy feasts into times for mourning . I will turn all your songs into weeping . You will have to wear the clothing of sadness . You will shave your heads . I will make you mourn as if your only son had died . The end of that time will be like a bitter day. ”
NIRV	Amos	8	11	The Lord and King announces , “ The days are coming when I will send hunger through the land . But people will not be hungry for food . They will not be thirsty for water . Instead , they will be hungry to hear a message from me .
NIRV	Amos	8	12	People will wander from the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean . They will travel from north to east . They will look for a message from me . But they will not find it .
NIRV	Amos	8	13	“ At that time “ the lovely young women and strong young men will faint because they are so thirsty .
NIRV	Amos	8	14	Some people make promises in the name of Samaria ’ s god . That god has led them astray . Others say , ‘ People of Dan , you can be sure that your god is alive. ’ Still others say , ‘ You can be sure that Beersheba ’ s god is alive. ’ But all these people will fall dead . They will never get up again. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Obadiah	1	1	This is the vision about Edom that Obadiah had . Here is what the Lord and King says about Edom . We ’ ve heard a message from the Lord . A messenger was sent to the nations . The Lord told him to say , “ Get up ! Let us go and make war against Edom. ”
NIRV	Obadiah	1	2	The Lord says to Edom , “ I will make you weak among the nations . They will look down on you .
NIRV	Obadiah	1	3	You live in the safety of the rocks . You make your home high up in the mountains . But your proud heart has tricked you . So you say to yourself , ‘ No one can bring me down to the ground. ’
NIRV	Obadiah	1	4	You have built your home as high as an eagle does . You have made your nest among the stars . But I will bring you down from there , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Obadiah	1	5	“ Edom , suppose robbers came to you at night . They would steal only as much as they wanted . Suppose grape pickers came to harvest your vines . They would still leave a few grapes . But you are facing horrible trouble !
NIRV	Obadiah	1	6	People of Esau , everything will be taken away from you . Your hidden treasures will be stolen .
NIRV	Obadiah	1	7	All those who are helping you will force you to leave your country . Your friends will trick you and overpower you . Those who eat bread with you will set a trap for you . But you will not see it. ”
NIRV	Obadiah	1	8	Here is what the Lord announces . “ At that time I will destroy the wise men of Edom . I will wipe out the men of understanding in the mountains of Esau .
NIRV	Obadiah	1	9	People of Teman , your soldiers will be terrified . Everyone in Esau ’ s mountains will be cut down by swords .
NIRV	Obadiah	1	10	You did harmful things to the people of Jacob . They are your relatives . So you will be covered with shame . You will be destroyed forever .
NIRV	Obadiah	1	11	Outsiders entered the gates of Jerusalem . They cast lots to see what each one would get . Strangers carried off its wealth . When that happened , you just stood there and did nothing . You were like one of them .
NIRV	Obadiah	1	12	That was a time of trouble for your relatives . So you shouldn ’ t have been happy about what happened to them . The people of Judah were destroyed . So you should not have been happy about it . You should not have laughed at them so much when they were in trouble .
NIRV	Obadiah	1	13	You should not have marched through the gates of my people ’ s city when they were in trouble . You shouldn ’ t have been happy about what happened to them . You should not have stolen their wealth when they were in trouble .
NIRV	Obadiah	1	14	You waited where the roads cross . You wanted to cut down those who were running away . You should not have done that . You handed over to their enemies those who were still left alive . You should not have done that . They were in trouble .
NIRV	Obadiah	1	15	“ The day of the Lord is near for all the nations . Others will do to you what you have done to them . You will be paid back for what you have done .
NIRV	Obadiah	1	16	You Edomites made my holy mountain of Zion impure by drinking and celebrating there . So all the nations will drink from the cup of my anger . And they will keep on drinking from it . They will vanish . It will be as if they had never existed .
NIRV	Obadiah	1	17	But on Mount Zion some of my people will be left alive . I will save them . Zion will be my holy mountain once again . And the people of Jacob will again receive the land as their own .
NIRV	Obadiah	1	18	They will be like a fire . Joseph ’ s people will be like a flame . The nation of Edom will be like straw . Jacob ’ s people will set Edom on fire and burn it up . No one will be left alive among Esau ’ s people. ” The Lord has spoken .
NIRV	Obadiah	1	19	Israelites from the Negev Desert will take over Esau ’ s mountains . Israelites from the western hills will possess the land of the Philistines . They ’ ll take over the territories of Ephraim and Samaria . Israelites from the tribe of Benjamin will possess the land of Gilead .
NIRV	Obadiah	1	20	Some Israelites were forced to leave their homes . They ’ ll come back to Canaan and possess it all the way to the town of Zarephath . Some people from Jerusalem were taken to the city of Sepharad . They ’ ll return and possess the towns of the Negev Desert .

NIRV	Jonah	1	1	A message from the Lord came to Jonah , the son of Amittai . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Jonah	1	2	“ Go to the great city of Nineveh . Preach against it . The sins of its people have come to my attention. ”
NIRV	Jonah	1	3	But Jonah ran away from the Lord . He headed for Tarshish . So he went down to the port of Joppa . There he found a ship that was going to Tarshish . He paid the fare and went on board . Then he sailed for Tarshish . He was running away from the Lord .
NIRV	Jonah	1	4	But the Lord sent a strong wind over the Mediterranean Sea . A wild storm came up . It was so wild that the ship was in danger of breaking apart .
NIRV	Jonah	1	5	All the sailors were afraid . Each one cried out to his own god for help . They threw the ship ’ s contents into the sea . They were trying to make the ship lighter . But Jonah had gone below deck . There he lay down and fell into a deep sleep .
NIRV	Jonah	1	6	The captain went down to him and said , “ How can you sleep ? Get up and call out to your god for help ! Maybe he ’ ll pay attention to what ’ s happening to us . Then we won ’ t die. ”
NIRV	Jonah	1	7	Here is what the sailors said to one another . “ Someone is to blame for getting us into all this trouble . Come . Let ’ s cast lots to find out who it is. ” So they did . And Jonah was picked .
NIRV	Jonah	1	8	They asked him , “ What terrible thing have you done to bring all this trouble on us ? Tell us . What do you do for a living ? Where do you come from ? What is your country ? What people do you belong to ? ”
NIRV	Jonah	1	9	He answered , “ I ’ m a Hebrew . I worship the Lord . He is the God of heaven . He made the sea and the dry land. ”
NIRV	Jonah	1	10	They found out he was running away from the Lord . That ’ s because he had told them . Then they became terrified . So they asked him , “ How could you do a thing like that ? ”
NIRV	Jonah	1	11	The sea was getting rougher and rougher . So they asked him , “ What should we do to you to make the sea calm down ? ”
NIRV	Jonah	1	12	“ Pick me up and throw me into the sea , ” he replied . “ Then it will become calm . I know it ’ s my fault that this terrible storm has come on you. ”
NIRV	Jonah	1	13	But the men didn ’ t do what he said . Instead , they did their best to row back to land . But they couldn ’ t . The sea got even rougher than before .
NIRV	Jonah	1	14	Then they cried out to the Lord . They prayed , “ Please , Lord , don ’ t let us die for taking this man ’ s life . After all , he might not be guilty of doing anything wrong . So don ’ t hold us responsible for killing him . Lord , you always do what you want to. ”
NIRV	Jonah	1	15	Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard . And the stormy sea became calm .
NIRV	Jonah	1	16	The men saw what had happened . Then they began to have great respect for the Lord . They offered a sacrifice to him . And they made promises to him . Jonah Prays to the Lord
NIRV	Jonah	1	17	Now the Lord sent a huge fish to swallow Jonah . And Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jonah	2	2	He said , “ When I was in trouble , I called out to the Lord . And he answered me . When I was deep in the place of the dead , I called out for help . And you listened to my cry .
NIRV	Jonah	2	1	From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the Lord his God .
NIRV	Jonah	2	3	You threw me deep into the Mediterranean Sea . I was deep down in its waters . They were all around me . All your rolling waves were sweeping over me .
NIRV	Jonah	2	4	I said , ‘ I have been driven away from you . But I will look again toward your holy temple in Jerusalem. ’
NIRV	Jonah	2	5	I had almost drowned in the waves . The deep waters were all around me . Seaweed was wrapped around my head .
NIRV	Jonah	2	6	I sank down to the bottom of the mountains . I thought I had died and gone down into the grave forever . But you are the Lord my God . You brought my life up from the very edge of the pit of death .
NIRV	Jonah	2	7	“ When my life was nearly over , I remembered you , Lord . My prayer rose up to you . It reached you in your holy temple in heaven .
NIRV	Jonah	2	8	“ Some people worship the worthless statues of their gods . They turn away from God ’ s love for them .
NIRV	Jonah	2	9	But I will sacrifice a thank offering to you . And I will shout with thankful praise . I will do what I have promised . I will say , ‘ Lord , you are the one who saves. ’ ”

NIRV	Jonah	3	3	Jonah obeyed the Lord . He went to Nineveh . It was a very large city . In fact , it took about three days to go through it .
NIRV	Jonah	3	2	“ Go to the great city of Nineveh . Announce to its people the message I give you. ”
NIRV	Jonah	3	4	Jonah began by going one whole day into the city . As he went , he announced , “ In
NIRV	Jonah	3	40	days Nineveh will be destroyed. ”
NIRV	Jonah	3	5	The people of Nineveh believed God ’ s warning . So they decided not to eat any food for a while . And all of them put on the rough clothing people wear when they ’ re sad . That ’ s what everyone did , from the least important of them to the most important .
NIRV	Jonah	3	6	Jonah ’ s warning reached the king of Nineveh . He got up from his throne . He took off his royal robes . He also dressed himself in the clothing of sadness . And then he sat down in the dust .
NIRV	Jonah	3	7	Here is the message he sent out to the people of Nineveh . “ I and my nobles give this order . Don ’ t let people or animals taste anything . That includes your herds and flocks . People and animals must not eat or drink anything .
NIRV	Jonah	3	8	Let people and animals alike be covered with the clothing of sadness . All of you must call out to God with all your hearts . Stop doing what is evil . Don ’ t harm others .
NIRV	Jonah	3	9	Who knows ? God might take pity on us . He might not be angry with us anymore . Then we won ’ t die. ”
NIRV	Jonah	3	10	God saw what they did . He saw that they stopped doing what was evil . So he took pity on them . He didn ’ t destroy them as he had said he would . Copyright ©

NIRV	Jonah	4	4	But the Lord replied , “ Is it right for you to be angry ? ”
NIRV	Jonah	4	2	He prayed to the Lord . Here is what Jonah said to him . “ Lord , isn ’ t this exactly what I thought would happen when I was still at home ? That is what I tried to prevent by running away to Tarshish . I knew that you are gracious . You are tender and kind . You are slow to get angry . You are full of love . You are a God who takes pity on people . You don ’ t want to destroy them .
NIRV	Jonah	4	3	Lord , take away my life . I ’ d rather die than live. ”
NIRV	Jonah	4	5	Jonah had left the city . He had sat down at a place east of it . There he put some branches over his head . He sat in their shade . He waited to see what would happen to the city .
NIRV	Jonah	4	6	Then the Lord God sent a leafy plant and made it grow up over Jonah . It gave him more shade for his head . It made him more comfortable . Jonah was very happy he had the leafy plant .
NIRV	Jonah	4	7	But before sunrise the next day , God sent a worm . It chewed the plant so much that it dried up .
NIRV	Jonah	4	8	When the sun rose , God sent a burning east wind . The sun beat down on Jonah ’ s head . It made him very weak . He wanted to die . So he said , “ I ’ d rather die than live. ”
NIRV	Jonah	4	9	But God spoke to Jonah . God said , “ Is it right for you to be angry about the plant ? ” “ It is , ” Jonah said . “ In fact , I ’ m so angry I wish I were dead. ”
NIRV	Jonah	4	10	But the Lord said , “ You have been concerned about this plant . But you did not take care of it . You did not make it grow . It grew up in one night and died the next .
NIRV	Jonah	4	11	And shouldn ’ t I show concern for the great city of Nineveh ? It has more than 120,000 people . They can ’ t tell right from wrong . Nineveh also has a lot of animals. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Micah	1	1	A message from the Lord came to Micah . He was from the town of Moresheth . The message came while Jotham , Ahaz and Hezekiah were kings of Judah . This is the vision Micah saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem . Here is what he said .
NIRV	Micah	1	2	Listen to me , all you nations ! Earth and everyone who lives in it , pay attention ! The Lord and King will be a witness against you . The Lord will speak from his holy temple in heaven . The Lord Will Judge Samaria and Jerusalem
NIRV	Micah	1	3	The Lord is about to come down from his home in heaven . He rules over even the highest places on earth .
NIRV	Micah	1	4	The mountains will melt under him like wax near a fire . The valleys will be broken apart by water rushing down a slope .
NIRV	Micah	1	5	All this will happen because Jacob ’ s people have done what is wrong . The people of Israel have committed many sins . Who is to blame for the wrong things Jacob has done ? Samaria ! Who is to blame for the high places where Judah ’ s people worship other gods ? Jerusalem !
NIRV	Micah	1	6	So the Lord says , “ I will turn Samaria into a pile of trash . It will become a place for planting vineyards . I will dump its stones down into the valley . And I will destroy it down to its very foundations .
NIRV	Micah	1	7	All the statues of Samaria ’ s gods will be broken to pieces . All the gifts its people gave to temple prostitutes will be burned with fire . I will destroy all the statues of its gods . Samaria collected gifts that were paid to temple prostitutes . So the Assyrians will use the gifts to pay their own temple prostitutes. ” Micah Weeps Over His People
NIRV	Micah	1	8	I will weep and mourn because Samaria will be destroyed . I ’ ll walk around barefoot and naked . I ’ ll bark like a wild dog . I ’ ll hoot like an owl .
NIRV	Micah	1	9	Samaria ’ s plague can ’ t be healed . The plague has spread to Judah . It has spread right up to the gate of my people . It has spread to Jerusalem itself .
NIRV	Micah	1	10	Don ’ t tell the people of Gath about it . Don ’ t let them see you weep . People in Beth Ophrah , roll in the dust .
NIRV	Micah	1	11	You who live in the town of Shaphir , leave naked and in shame . Those who live in Zaanan won ’ t come out to help you . The people in Beth Ezel will mourn . They won ’ t be able to help keep you safe any longer .
NIRV	Micah	1	12	Those who live in Maroth will groan with pain as they wait for help . That ’ s because the Lord will bring trouble on them . It will reach the very gate of Jerusalem .
NIRV	Micah	1	13	You who live in Lachish , get your fast horses ready to pull their chariots . You trust in military power . Lachish was where sin began for the people of Zion . The wrong things Israel did were also done by you .
NIRV	Micah	1	14	People of Judah , you might as well say goodbye to Moresheth near Gath . The town of Akzib won ’ t give any help to the kings of Israel .
NIRV	Micah	1	15	An enemy will attack you who live in Mareshah . Israel ’ s nobles will have to run away and hide in the cave of Adullam .
NIRV	Micah	1	16	The children you enjoy so much will be taken away as prisoners . So shave your heads and mourn . Make them as bare as the head of a vulture . Copyright ©

NIRV	Micah	2	2	If they want fields or houses , they take them . They cheat people out of their homes . They rob them of their property .
NIRV	Micah	2	3	So the Lord says to them , “ I am planning to send trouble on you . You will not be able to save yourselves from it . You will not live so proudly anymore . It will be a time of trouble .
NIRV	Micah	2	4	At that time people will make fun of you . They will tease you by singing a song of sadness . They will pretend to be you and say , ‘ We are totally destroyed . Our enemies have divided up our land . The Lord has taken it away from us ! He has given our fields to those who turned against us. ’ ”
NIRV	Micah	2	5	So you won ’ t even have anyone left in the Lord ’ s community who can divide up the land for you . Some Prophets Aren ’ t Really Prophets at All
NIRV	Micah	2	6	“ Don ’ t prophesy , ” the people ’ s prophets say . “ Don ’ t prophesy about bad things . Nothing shameful is going to happen to us. ”
NIRV	Micah	2	7	People of Jacob , should anyone say , “ The Lord is patient , so he wouldn ’ t do things like that ” ? The Lord replies , “ What I promise brings good things to those who lead honest lives .
NIRV	Micah	2	8	But lately my people have attacked one another as if they were enemies . You strip off the rich robes from those who happen to pass by . They thought they were as safe as men returning from a battle they had won .
NIRV	Micah	2	9	You drive the women among my people out of their pleasant homes . You take away my blessing from their children forever .
NIRV	Micah	2	10	Get up ! Leave this land ! It is no longer your resting place . You have made it ‘ unclean. ’ You have completely destroyed it .
NIRV	Micah	2	11	Suppose a prophet goes around telling lies . And he prophesies that you will have plenty of wine and beer . Then that kind of prophet would be just right for this nation ! The Lord Promises to Save His People
NIRV	Micah	2	12	“ People of Jacob , I will gather all of you . I will bring together you who are still left alive in Israel . I will gather you together like sheep in a pen . You will be like a flock in its grasslands . Your country will be filled with people .
NIRV	Micah	2	13	I will open the way for you to return . I will march in front of you . You will break through the city gates and go free . I am your King . I will pass through the gates in front of you . I , the Lord , will lead the way. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Micah	3	3	You eat my people ’ s bodies . You strip off their skin . You break their bones in pieces . You chop them up like meat . You put them in a cooking pot. ”
NIRV	Micah	3	2	But you hate what is good . And you love what is evil . You are like someone who tears the skin off my people . You pull the meat off their bones .
NIRV	Micah	3	4	The time will come when Israel will cry out to the Lord . But he won ’ t answer them . In fact , he ’ ll turn his face away from them . They have done what is evil .
NIRV	Micah	3	5	The Lord says , “ The prophets are those who lead my people astray . If my people feed them , the prophets promise them peace . If my people do not feed them , the prophets prepare to go to war against them .
NIRV	Micah	3	6	So night will come on the prophets . But they will not have any visions . Darkness will cover them . But they will not be able to figure out what is going to happen . The sun will set on the prophets . The day will become dark for them .
NIRV	Micah	3	7	Those who see visions will be put to shame . Those who try to figure out what is going to happen will be dishonored . All of them will cover their faces . I will not answer them. ”
NIRV	Micah	3	8	The Spirit of the Lord has filled me with power . He helps me do what is fair . He makes me brave . Now I ’ m prepared to tell Jacob ’ s people what they ’ ve done wrong . I ’ m ready to tell Israel they ’ ve sinned .
NIRV	Micah	3	9	Listen to me , you leaders of Jacob ’ s people ! Pay attention , you rulers of Israel ! You hate to do what is fair . You twist everything that is right .
NIRV	Micah	3	10	You build up Zion by spilling the blood of others . You build Jerusalem by doing what is evil .
NIRV	Micah	3	11	Your judges take money from people who want special favors . Your priests teach only if they get paid for it . Your prophets won ’ t tell fortunes unless they receive money . But you still look for the Lord ’ s help . You say , “ The Lord is with us . No trouble will come on us. ”
NIRV	Micah	3	12	So because of what you have done , Zion will be plowed up like a field . Jerusalem will be turned into a pile of trash . The temple hill will be covered with bushes and weeds . Copyright ©

NIRV	Micah	4	4	Everyone will have their own vine and fig tree . And no one will make them afraid . That ’ s what the Lord who rules over all has promised .
NIRV	Micah	4	2	People from many nations will go there . They will say , “ Come , let us go up to the Lord ’ s mountain . Let ’ s go to the temple of Jacob ’ s God . He will teach us how we should live . Then we will live the way he wants us to. ” The law of the Lord will be taught at Zion . His message will go out from Jerusalem .
NIRV	Micah	4	3	He will judge between people from many nations . He ’ ll settle problems among strong nations everywhere . They will hammer their swords into plows . They ’ ll hammer their spears into pruning tools . Nations will not go to war against one another . They won ’ t even train to fight anymore .
NIRV	Micah	4	5	Other nations worship and trust in their gods . But we will worship and obey the Lord . He will be our God for ever and ever . The Lord ’ s Plan
NIRV	Micah	4	6	“ The time is coming when I will gather those who are disabled , ” announces the Lord . “ I will bring together those who were taken away as prisoners . I will gather those I have allowed to suffer .
NIRV	Micah	4	7	I will make the disabled my faithful people . I will make into a strong nation those driven away from their homes . I will rule over them on Mount Zion . I will be their King from that time on and forever .
NIRV	Micah	4	8	Jerusalem , you used to be like a guard tower for my flock . City of Zion , you used to be a place of safety for my people . The glorious kingdom you had before will be given back to you . Once again a king will rule over your people. ”
NIRV	Micah	4	9	Why are you crying out so loudly now ? Don ’ t you have a king ? Has your ruler died ? Is that why pain comes on you like the pain of a woman having a baby ?
NIRV	Micah	4	10	People of Zion , groan with pain . Cry out like a woman having a baby . Soon you must leave your city . You must camp in the open fields . You will have to go to the land of Babylon . But that ’ s where the Lord will save you . There he will set you free from the power of your enemies .
NIRV	Micah	4	11	But now many nations have gathered together to attack you . They say , “ Let Jerusalem be made ‘ unclean. ’ We want to laugh when Zion suffers ! ”
NIRV	Micah	4	12	But those nations don ’ t know what the Lord has in mind . They don ’ t understand his plan . He has planned to gather them up like bundles of grain . He has planned to take them to his threshing floor .
NIRV	Micah	4	13	The Lord says , “ People of Zion , get up and crush your enemies . I will make you like a threshing ox . I will give you iron horns and bronze hooves . So you will crush many nations. ” They got their money in the wrong way . But you will set it apart to the Lord . You will give their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth . Copyright ©

NIRV	Micah	5	5	And he will be our peace when the Assyrians attack our land . They will march through our forts . But we will raise up against them many shepherds . We ’ ll send out against them as many commanders as we need to .
NIRV	Micah	5	2	The Lord says , “ Bethlehem Ephrathah , you might not be an important town in the nation of Judah . But out of you will come for me a ruler over Israel . His family line goes back to the early years of your nation . It goes all the way back to days of long ago. ”
NIRV	Micah	5	3	The Lord will hand over his people to their enemies . That will last until the pregnant woman bears her promised son . Then the rest of his relatives in Judah will return to their land .
NIRV	Micah	5	4	That promised son will stand firm and be a shepherd for his flock . The Lord will give him the strength to do it . The Lord his God will give him the authority to rule . His people will live safely . His greatness will reach from one end of the earth to the other .
NIRV	Micah	5	6	They will use their swords to rule over Assyria . They ’ ll rule the land of Nimrod with swords that are ready to strike . The Assyrians will march across our borders and attack our land . But the promised ruler will save us from them .
NIRV	Micah	5	7	Jacob ’ s people who are still left alive will be scattered among many nations . They will be like dew the Lord has sent . Dew doesn ’ t depend on any human being . They will be like rain that falls on the grass . Rain doesn ’ t wait for someone to give it orders .
NIRV	Micah	5	8	So Jacob ’ s people will be scattered among many nations . They will be like a lion among the animals in the forest . They ’ ll be like a young lion among flocks of sheep . Lions attack and tear apart their prey as they move along . No one can keep them from killing what they want .
NIRV	Micah	5	9	Lord , your power will win the battle over your enemies . All of them will be destroyed .
NIRV	Micah	5	10	“ At that time I will destroy your war horses , ” announces the Lord . “ I will smash your chariots .
NIRV	Micah	5	11	I will destroy the cities in your land . I will tear down all your forts .
NIRV	Micah	5	12	I will destroy your worship of evil powers . You will no longer be able to put a spell on anyone .
NIRV	Micah	5	13	I will destroy the statues of your gods . I will take your sacred stones away from you . You will no longer bow down to the gods your hands have made .
NIRV	Micah	5	14	I will pull down the poles you used to worship the female god named Asherah . That will happen when I completely destroy your cities .
NIRV	Micah	5	15	I will pay back the nations that have not obeyed me . I will direct my anger against them. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Micah	6	6	The people of Israel say , “ What should we bring with us when we go to worship the Lord ? What should we offer the God of heaven when we bow down to him ? Should we take burnt offerings to him ? Should we sacrifice calves that are a year old ?
NIRV	Micah	6	2	Hear the Lord ’ s case , you mountains . Listen , you age-old foundations of the earth . The Lord has a case against his people Israel . He is bringing charges against them .
NIRV	Micah	6	3	The Lord says , “ My people , what have I done to you ? Have I made things too hard for you ? Answer me .
NIRV	Micah	6	4	I brought your people up out of Egypt . I set them free from the land where they were slaves . I sent Moses to lead them . Aaron and Miriam helped him .
NIRV	Micah	6	5	Remember how Balak , the king of Moab , planned to put a curse on your people . But Balaam , the son of Beor , gave them a blessing instead . Remember their journey from Shittim to Gilgal . I want you to know that I always do what is right. ”
NIRV	Micah	6	7	Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams ? Will he take delight in 10,000 rivers of olive oil ? Should we offer our oldest sons for the wrong things we ’ ve done ? Should we sacrifice our own children to pay for our sins ? ”
NIRV	Micah	6	8	The Lord has shown you what is good . He has told you what he requires of you . You must act with justice . You must love to show mercy . And you must be humble as you live in the sight of your God . The Lord Will Punish His Guilty People
NIRV	Micah	6	9	The Lord is calling out to Jerusalem . And it would be wise to pay attention to him . He says , “ Listen , tribe of Judah and you people who are gathered in the city .
NIRV	Micah	6	10	You sinful people , should I forget that you got your treasures by stealing them ? You use dishonest measures to cheat others . I have placed a curse on that practice .
NIRV	Micah	6	11	Should I forgive anyone who uses dishonest scales ? They use weights that weigh things heavier or lighter than they really are .
NIRV	Micah	6	12	The rich people among you harm others . You are always telling lies . You try to fool others by what you say .
NIRV	Micah	6	13	So I have begun to strike you down . I have begun to destroy you because you have sinned so much .
NIRV	Micah	6	14	You will eat . But you will not be satisfied . Your stomachs will still be empty . You will try to save what you can . But you will not be able to . If you do save something , it will be destroyed in battle .
NIRV	Micah	6	15	You will plant seeds . But you will not harvest any crops . You will press olives . But you will not use the oil . You will crush grapes . But you will not drink the wine that is made from them .
NIRV	Micah	6	16	You have followed the evil practices of King Omri of Israel . You have done what the family of King Ahab did . You have followed their bad example . So I will let you be destroyed . Others will make fun of you . The nations will laugh at you. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Micah	7	7	But I will look to the Lord . I ’ ll put my trust in God my Savior . He will hear me . Jerusalem Will Be Rebuilt
NIRV	Micah	7	2	Faithful people have disappeared from the land . Those who are honest are gone . Everyone hides and waits to spill the blood of others . They use nets to try and trap one another .
NIRV	Micah	7	3	They are very good at doing what is evil . Rulers require gifts . Judges accept money from people who want special favors . Those who are powerful always get what they want . All of them make evil plans together .
NIRV	Micah	7	4	The best of these people are as harmful as thorns . The most honest of them are even worse . God has come to punish you . The time your prophets warned you about has come . Panic has taken hold of you .
NIRV	Micah	7	5	Don ’ t trust your neighbors . Don ’ t put your faith in your friends . Be careful what you say even to your own wife .
NIRV	Micah	7	6	Sons don ’ t honor their fathers . Daughters refuse to obey their mothers . Daughters-in-law are against their mothers-in-law . A man ’ s enemies are the members of his own family .
NIRV	Micah	7	8	The people of Jerusalem say , “ Don ’ t laugh when we suffer , you enemies of ours ! We have fallen . But we ’ ll get up . Even though we sit in the dark , the Lord will give us light .
NIRV	Micah	7	9	We ’ ve sinned against the Lord . So he is angry with us . His anger will continue until he takes up our case . Then he ’ ll do what is right for us . He ’ ll bring us out into the light . Then we ’ ll see him save us .
NIRV	Micah	7	10	Our enemies will see it too . And they will be put to shame . After all , they said to us , ‘ Where is the Lord your God ? ’ But we will see them destroyed . Soon they will be stomped on like mud in the streets. ”
NIRV	Micah	7	11	People of Jerusalem , the time will come when your walls will be rebuilt . Land will be added to your territory .
NIRV	Micah	7	12	At that time your people will come back to you . They ’ ll return from Assyria and the cities of Egypt . They ’ ll come from the countries between Egypt and the Euphrates River . They ’ ll return from the lands between the seas . They ’ ll come back from the countries between the mountains .
NIRV	Micah	7	13	But the rest of the earth will be deserted . The people who live in it have done many evil things . Prayer and Praise
NIRV	Micah	7	14	Lord , be like a shepherd to your people . Take good care of them . They are your flock . They live by themselves in the safety of a forest . Rich grasslands are all around them . Let them eat grass in Bashan and Gilead just as they did long ago .
NIRV	Micah	7	15	The Lord says to his people , “ I showed you my wonders when you came out of Egypt long ago . In the same way , I will show them to you again. ”
NIRV	Micah	7	16	When the nations see those wonders , they will be put to shame . All their power will be taken away from them . They will be so amazed that they won ’ t be able to speak or hear .
NIRV	Micah	7	17	They ’ ll be forced to eat dust like a snake . They ’ ll be like creatures that have to crawl on the ground . They ’ ll come out of their dens trembling with fear . They ’ ll show respect for the Lord our God . They will also have respect for his people .
NIRV	Micah	7	18	Lord , who is a God like you ? You forgive sin . You forgive your people when they do what is wrong . You don ’ t stay angry forever . Instead , you take delight in showing your faithful love to them .
NIRV	Micah	7	19	Once again you will show loving concern for us . You will completely wipe out the evil things we ’ ve done . You will throw all our sins into the bottom of the sea .
NIRV	Micah	7	20	You will be faithful to Jacob ’ s people . You will show your love to Abraham ’ s children . You will do what you promised to do for our people . You made that promise long ago . Copyright ©

NIRV	Nahum	1	1	Here is a prophecy the Lord gave Nahum , who was from the town of Elkosh . The prophecy came in a vision and is written in a book . The prophecy is about Nineveh . The Lord Is Angry With Nineveh
NIRV	Nahum	1	2	The Lord is a jealous God who punishes people . He pays them back for the evil things they do . He directs his anger against them . The Lord punishes his enemies . He holds his anger back until the right time to use it .
NIRV	Nahum	1	3	The Lord is slow to get angry . But he is very powerful . The Lord will not let guilty people go without punishing them . When he marches out , he stirs up winds and storms . Clouds are the dust kicked up by his feet .
NIRV	Nahum	1	4	He controls the seas . He dries them up . He makes all the rivers run dry . Bashan and Mount Carmel dry up . The flowers in Lebanon fade .
NIRV	Nahum	1	5	He causes the mountains to shake . The hills melt away . The earth trembles because he is there . The world and all those who live in it also tremble .
NIRV	Nahum	1	6	Who can stand firm when his anger burns ? Who can live when he is angry ? His anger blazes out like fire . He smashes the rocks to pieces .
NIRV	Nahum	1	7	The Lord is good . When people are in trouble , they can go to him for safety . He takes good care of those who trust in him .
NIRV	Nahum	1	8	But he will destroy Nineveh with a powerful flood . He will chase his enemies into the place of darkness .
NIRV	Nahum	1	9	The Lord will put an end to anything they plan against him . He won ’ t allow Assyria to win the battle over his people a second time .
NIRV	Nahum	1	10	His enemies will be tangled up among thorns . Their wine will make them drunk . They ’ ll be burned up like dry straw .
NIRV	Nahum	1	11	Nineveh , a king has marched out from you . He makes evil plans against the Lord . He thinks about how he can do what is wrong .
NIRV	Nahum	1	12	The Lord says , “ His army has many soldiers . Other nations are helping them . But they will be destroyed and pass away . Judah , I punished you . But I will not do it anymore .
NIRV	Nahum	1	13	Now I will break Assyria ’ s yoke off your neck . I will tear off the ropes that hold you. ”
NIRV	Nahum	1	14	Nineveh , the Lord has given an order concerning you . He has said , “ You will not have any children to carry on your name . I will destroy the wooden and metal statues that are in the temple of your gods . I will get your grave ready for you . You are worthless. ”
NIRV	Nahum	1	15	Look at the mountains of Judah ! I see a messenger running to bring good news ! He ’ s telling us that peace has come ! People of Judah , celebrate your feasts . Carry out your promises . The evil Assyrians won ’ t attack you again . They ’ ll be completely destroyed . Copyright ©

NIRV	Nahum	2	2	Assyria once took everything of value from God ’ s people . Its army destroyed all their vines . But the Lord will bring back the glory of Jacob ’ s people . He ’ ll make Israel glorious again .
NIRV	Nahum	2	3	The shields of the soldiers are red . The warriors are dressed in bright red uniforms . The metal on their chariots flashes when they are prepared for war . Their spears made out of juniper are ready to use .
NIRV	Nahum	2	4	The chariots race through the main streets . They rush back and forth through them . They look like flaming torches . They dart around like lightning .
NIRV	Nahum	2	5	Nineveh sends for their special troops . But they trip and fall on their way . They run toward the city wall . They keep their shield in front of them .
NIRV	Nahum	2	6	The attackers open the gates that hold back the waters of the river . And the palace falls down .
NIRV	Nahum	2	7	The attackers order that Nineveh ’ s people be taken away as prisoners . The female slaves sound like doves as they mourn . They beat their chests .
NIRV	Nahum	2	8	Nineveh is like a pool whose water is draining away . “ Stop running away ! ” someone cries out . But no one turns back .
NIRV	Nahum	2	9	“ Steal the silver ! ” the attackers shout . “ Grab the gold ! ” The supply is endless . There is plenty of wealth among all the city ’ s treasures .
NIRV	Nahum	2	10	Nineveh is destroyed , robbed and stripped ! Hearts melt away in fear . Knees give way . Bodies tremble with fear . Everyone ’ s face turns pale .
NIRV	Nahum	2	11	Assyria is like a lion . Where is the lions ’ den now ? Where did they feed their cubs ? Where did all the lions go ? In their den they had nothing to fear .
NIRV	Nahum	2	12	The lion killed enough for his cubs to eat . He choked what he caught for his mate . He filled his home with what he had killed . He brought to his dens what he had caught .
NIRV	Nahum	2	13	“ Nineveh , I am against you , ” announces the Lord who rules over all . “ I will burn up your chariots with fire . Your young lions will be killed by swords . I will leave you nothing on earth to catch . The voices of your messengers will no longer be heard. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Nahum	3	3	Horsemen attack ! Swords flash ! Spears gleam ! Many people die . Dead bodies pile up . They can ’ t even be counted . People trip over them .
NIRV	Nahum	3	2	Whips crack ! Wheels clack ! Horses charge ! Chariots rumble !
NIRV	Nahum	3	4	All of that was caused by the evil desires of the prostitute Nineveh . That woman who practiced evil magic was very beautiful . She used her sinful charms to make slaves out of the nations . She worshiped evil powers in order to trap others .
NIRV	Nahum	3	5	“ Nineveh , I am against you , ” announces the Lord who rules over all . “ I will pull your skirts up over your face . I will show the nations your naked body . Kingdoms will make fun of your shame .
NIRV	Nahum	3	6	I will throw garbage at you . I will look down on you . I will make an example out of you .
NIRV	Nahum	3	7	All those who see you will run away from you . They will say , ‘ Nineveh is destroyed . Who will mourn over it ? ’ Where can I find someone to comfort your people ? ”
NIRV	Nahum	3	8	Nineveh , are you better than Thebes on the Nile River ? There was water all around that city . The river helped to keep it safe . The waters were like a wall around it .
NIRV	Nahum	3	9	Cush and Egypt gave it all the strength it needed . Put and Libya also helped it .
NIRV	Nahum	3	10	But Thebes was captured anyway . Its people were taken away as prisoners . Its babies were smashed to pieces at every street corner . The Assyrian soldiers cast lots for all its nobles . They put them in chains and made slaves out of them .
NIRV	Nahum	3	11	People of Nineveh , you too will get drunk . You will try to hide from your enemies . You will look for a place of safety .
NIRV	Nahum	3	12	All your forts are like fig trees that have their first ripe fruit on them . When the trees are shaken , the figs fall into the mouths of those who eat them .
NIRV	Nahum	3	13	Look at your troops . All of them are weak . The gates of your forts are wide open to your enemies . Fire has destroyed the bars that lock your gates .
NIRV	Nahum	3	14	Prepare for the attack by storing up water ! Make your walls as strong as you can ! Make some bricks out of clay ! Mix the mud to hold them together ! Use them to repair the walls !
NIRV	Nahum	3	15	In spite of all your hard work , fire will burn you up inside your city . Your enemies will cut you down with their swords . They will destroy you just as a swarm of locusts eats up crops . Multiply like grasshoppers ! Increase your numbers like locusts !
NIRV	Nahum	3	16	You have more traders than the number of stars in the sky . But like locusts they strip the land . Then they fly away .
NIRV	Nahum	3	17	Your guards are like grasshoppers . Your officials are like swarms of locusts . They settle in the walls on a cold day . But when the sun appears , they fly away . And no one knows where they go .
NIRV	Nahum	3	18	King of Assyria , your leaders are asleep . Your nobles lie down to rest . Your people are scattered on the mountains . No one is left to gather them together .
NIRV	Nahum	3	19	Nothing can heal your wounds . You will die of them . All those who hear the news about you clap their hands . That ’ s because you have fallen from power . Is there anyone who has not suffered because of how badly you treated them ? Copyright ©

NIRV	Habakkuk	1	1	This is a prophecy that Habakkuk the prophet received from the Lord . Here is what Habakkuk said . Habakkuk Complains to the Lord
NIRV	Habakkuk	1	2	Lord , how long do I have to call out for help ? Why don ’ t you listen to me ? How long must I keep telling you that things are terrible ? Why don ’ t you save us ?
NIRV	Habakkuk	1	3	Why do you make me watch while people treat others so unfairly ? Why do you put up with the wrong things they are doing ? I have to look at death . People are harming others . They are arguing and fighting all the time .
NIRV	Habakkuk	1	4	The law can ’ t do what it ’ s supposed to do . Fairness never comes out on top . Sinful people surround those who do what is right . So people are never treated fairly . The Lord Replies to Habakkuk
NIRV	Habakkuk	1	5	The Lord replies , “ Look at the nations . Watch them . Be totally amazed at what you see . I am going to do something in your days that you would never believe . You would not believe it even if someone told you about it .
NIRV	Habakkuk	1	6	I am going to send the armies of Babylon to attack you . They are very mean . They move quickly . They sweep across the whole earth . They take over homes that do not belong to them .
NIRV	Habakkuk	1	7	They terrify others . They do not recognize any laws but their own . That is how proud they are .
NIRV	Habakkuk	1	8	Their horses are faster than leopards . They are meaner than wolves at sunset . Their horsemen charge straight into battle . They ride in from far away . They come down like an eagle diving for its food .
NIRV	Habakkuk	1	9	All of them are ready and willing to destroy others . Their huge armies advance like a wind out of the desert . They gather prisoners like sand .
NIRV	Habakkuk	1	10	They mock kings and make fun of rulers . They laugh at all the cities that have high walls around them . They build dirt ramps against the walls and capture the cities .
NIRV	Habakkuk	1	11	They sweep past like the wind . Then they go on their way . They are guilty . They worship their own strength. ” Habakkuk Complains to the Lord Again
NIRV	Habakkuk	1	12	Lord , haven ’ t you existed forever ? You are my holy God . You will never die . Lord , you have appointed the Babylonians to punish your people . My Rock , you have chosen them to judge us .
NIRV	Habakkuk	1	13	Your eyes are too pure to look at what is evil . You can ’ t put up with the wrong things people do . So why do you put up with those who can ’ t be trusted ? The evil Babylonians swallow up those who are more godly than themselves . So why are you silent ?
NIRV	Habakkuk	1	14	You have made people to be like the fish in the sea . They are like the sea creatures that don ’ t have a ruler .
NIRV	Habakkuk	1	15	The evil Babylonians pull all of them up with hooks . They catch them in their nets . They gather them up . So they celebrate . They are glad .
NIRV	Habakkuk	1	16	They offer sacrifices to their nets . They burn incense to them . Their nets allow them to live in great comfort . They enjoy the finest food .
NIRV	Habakkuk	1	17	Are you going to let them keep on emptying their nets ? Will they go on destroying nations without showing them any mercy ? Copyright ©

NIRV	Habakkuk	2	2	The Lord replies , “ Write down the message I am giving you . Write it clearly on the tablets you use . Then a messenger can read it and run to announce it .
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	3	The message I give you waits for the time I have appointed . It speaks about what is going to happen . And all of it will come true . It might take a while . But wait for it . You can be sure it will come . It will happen when I want it to .
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	4	“ The Babylonians are very proud . What they want is not good . “ But the person who is godly will live by his faithfulness .
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	5	“ Wine makes the Babylonians do foolish things . They are proud . They never rest . Like the grave , they are always hungry for more . Like death , they are never satisfied . They gather all the nations to themselves . They take all those people away as prisoners .
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	6	“ Won ’ t those people laugh at the Babylonians ? Won ’ t they make fun of them ? They will say to them , “ ‘ How terrible it will be for you who pile up stolen goods ! You get rich by cheating others . How long will this go on ? ’
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	7	Those you owe money to will suddenly rise up . They will wake up and make you tremble with fear . Then they will take away everything you have .
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	8	You have robbed many nations . So the nations that are left will rob you . You have spilled human blood . You have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them .
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	9	“ How terrible it will be for the Babylonians ! They build their kingdom with money that they gained by cheating others . They have tried to make the kingdom as secure as possible . After all , they did not want to be destroyed .
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	10	They have planned to wipe out many nations . But they have brought shame on their own kingdom . So they must pay with their own lives .
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	11	The stones in the walls of their homes will cry out . And the wooden beams will echo that cry .
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	12	“ How terrible it will be for the Babylonians ! They build cities by spilling the blood of others . They establish towns by doing what is wrong .
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	13	I am the Lord who rules over all . Human effort is no better than wood that feeds a fire . So the nations wear themselves out for nothing .
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	14	The oceans are full of water . In the same way , the earth will be filled with the knowledge of my glory .
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	15	“ How terrible it will be for the Babylonians ! They give drinks to their neighbors . They pour the drinks from wineskins until their neighbors are drunk . They want to look at their naked bodies .
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	16	But the Babylonians will be filled with shame instead of glory . So now it is their turn to drink and be stripped of their clothes . The cup of anger in my powerful right hand is going to punish them . They will be covered with shame instead of glory .
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	17	The harm they have done to Lebanon will bring them down . Because they have killed so many animals , animals will terrify them . They have spilled human blood . They have destroyed lands and cities and everyone in them .
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	18	“ If someone carves a statue of a god , what is it worth ? What value is there in a god that teaches lies ? The one who trusts in this kind of god worships his own creation . He makes statues of gods that can ’ t speak .
NIRV	Habakkuk	2	19	How terrible it will be for the Babylonians ! They say to a wooden god , ‘ Come to life ! ’ They say to a stone god , ‘ Wake up ! ’ Can those gods give advice ? They are covered with gold and silver . They can ’ t even breathe. ”

NIRV	Habakkuk	3	3	God came from Teman . The Holy One came from Mount Paran . His glory covered the heavens . His praise filled the earth .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	2	Lord , I know how famous you are . I have great respect for you because of your mighty acts . Do them again for us . Make them known in our time . When you are angry , please have mercy on us .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	4	His glory was like the sunrise . Rays of light flashed from his mighty hand . His power was hidden there .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	5	He sent plagues ahead of him . Sickness followed behind him .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	6	When he stood up , the earth shook . When he looked at the nations , they trembled with fear . The age-old mountains crumbled . The ancient hills fell down . But he marches on forever .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	7	I saw the tents of Cushan in trouble . The people of Midian were suffering greatly .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	8	Lord , were you angry with the rivers ? Were you angry with the streams ? Were you angry with the Red Sea ? You rode your horses and chariots to overcome it .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	9	You got your bow ready to use . You asked for many arrows . You broke up the surface of the earth with rivers .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	10	The mountains saw you and shook . Floods of water swept by . The sea roared . It lifted its waves high .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	11	The sun and moon stood still in the sky . They stopped because your flying arrows flashed by . Your gleaming spear shone like lightning .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	12	When you were angry , you marched across the earth . Because of your anger you destroyed the nations .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	13	You came out to set your people free . You saved your chosen ones . You crushed Pharaoh , the leader of that evil land of Egypt . You stripped him from head to foot .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	14	His soldiers rushed out to scatter us . They were laughing at us . They thought they would easily destroy us . They saw us as weak people who were trying to hide . So you wounded Pharaoh ’ s head with his own spear .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	15	Your horses charged into the Red Sea . They stirred up the great waters .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	16	I listened and my heart pounded . My lips trembled at the sound . My bones seemed to rot . And my legs shook . But I will be patient . I ’ ll wait for the day of trouble to come on Babylon . It ’ s the nation that is attacking us .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	17	The fig trees might not bud . The vines might not produce any grapes . The olive crop might fail . The fields might not produce any food . There might not be any sheep in the pens . There might not be any cattle in the barns .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	18	But I will still be glad because of what the Lord has done . God my Savior fills me with joy .
NIRV	Habakkuk	3	19	The Lord and King gives me strength . He makes my feet like the feet of a deer . He helps me walk on the highest places . This prayer is for the director of music . It should be sung while being accompanied by stringed instruments . Copyright ©

The Lord spoke to Zephaniah during the rule of Josiah . He was king of Judah and the son of Amon . The Lord Will Judge the Whole World
NIRV	Zephaniah	1	2	“ I will sweep away everything from the face of the earth , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Zephaniah	1	3	“ I will destroy people and animals alike . I will wipe out the birds in the sky and the fish in the waters . I will destroy the statues of gods that cause evil people to sin . That will happen when I destroy all human beings on the face of the earth , ” announces the Lord .

NIRV	Zephaniah	1	7	Be silent in front of him . He is the Lord and King . The day of the Lord is near . The Lord has prepared a sacrifice . He has set apart for himself the people he has invited .
NIRV	Zephaniah	1	8	When the Lord ’ s sacrifice is ready to be offered , I will punish the officials and the king ’ s sons . I will also judge all those who follow the practices of other nations .
NIRV	Zephaniah	1	9	At that time I will punish all those who worship other gods . They fill the temples of their gods with lies and other harmful things .

NIRV	Zephaniah	1	11	Cry out , you who live in the market places . All your merchants will be wiped out . Those who trade in silver will be destroyed .
NIRV	Zephaniah	1	12	At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps . I will punish those who are so contented . They are like wine that has not been shaken up . They think , ‘ The Lord won ’ t do anything . He won ’ t do anything good or bad. ’
NIRV	Zephaniah	1	13	Their wealth will be stolen . Their houses will be destroyed . They will build houses . But they will not live in them . They will plant vineyards . But they will not drink the wine they produce .
NIRV	Zephaniah	1	14	The great day of the Lord is near . In fact , it is coming quickly . The cries on that day are bitter . The Mighty Warrior shouts his battle cry .

NIRV	Zephaniah	1	16	Trumpet blasts and battle cries will be heard . Soldiers will attack cities that have forts and corner towers .
NIRV	Zephaniah	1	17	I will bring great trouble on all people . So they will feel their way around like blind people . They have sinned against the Lord . Their blood will be poured out like dust . Their bodies will lie rotting on the ground .

NIRV	Zephaniah	3	4	Their prophets care about nothing . They can ’ t be trusted . Their priests make the temple “ unclean. ” They break the law they teach others to obey .

NIRV	Zephaniah	3	7	Here is what I thought about Jerusalem . ‘ Surely you will have respect for me . Surely you will accept my warning. ’ Then the city you think is safe would not be destroyed . And I would not have to punish you so much . But they still wanted to go on sinning in every way they could .

NIRV	Zephaniah	3	11	Jerusalem , you have done many wrong things to me . But at that time you will not be put to shame anymore . That ’ s because I will remove from this city those who think so highly of themselves . You will never be proud again on my holy mountain of Zion .
NIRV	Zephaniah	3	12	But inside your city I will leave those who are not proud at all . Those who are still left alive will trust in the Lord .
NIRV	Zephaniah	3	13	They will not do anything wrong . They will not tell any lies . They will not say anything to fool other people . They will eat and lie down in peace . And no one will make them afraid. ”
NIRV	Zephaniah	3	14	People of Zion , sing ! Israel , shout loudly ! People of Jerusalem , be glad ! Let your hearts be full of joy .

NIRV	Zephaniah	3	16	The time is coming when people will say to Jerusalem , “ Zion , don ’ t be afraid . Don ’ t give up .
NIRV	Zephaniah	3	17	The Lord your God is with you . He is the Mighty Warrior who saves . He will take great delight in you . In his love he will no longer punish you . Instead , he will sing for joy because of you. ”
NIRV	Zephaniah	3	18	The Lord says to his people , “ You used to celebrate my appointed feasts in Jerusalem . You are sad because you can ’ t do that anymore . Other people make fun of you because of that . That sadness was a heavy load for you to carry . But I will remove that load from you .
NIRV	Zephaniah	3	19	At that time I will punish all those who crushed you . I will save those among you who are disabled . I will gather those who have been taken away . I will give them praise and honor in every land where they have been put to shame .
NIRV	Zephaniah	3	20	At that time I will gather you together . And I will bring you home . I will give you honor and praise among all the nations on earth . I will bless you with great success again , ” says the Lord . Copyright ©

NIRV	Haggai	1	1	A message from the Lord came to Haggai the prophet . Haggai gave it to Zerubbabel and Joshua . Zerubbabel was governor of Judah and the son of Shealtiel . Joshua was high priest and the son of Jozadak . The message came on the first day of the sixth month of the second year that Darius was king of Persia . Here is what Haggai said .
NIRV	Haggai	1	2	Here is what the Lord who rules over all says . “ The people of Judah say , ‘ It ’ s not yet time to rebuild the Lord ’ s temple. ’ ”
NIRV	Haggai	1	3	So the message from the Lord came to me . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Haggai	1	4	“ My temple is still destroyed . But you are living in your houses that have beautiful wooden walls. ”
NIRV	Haggai	1	5	The Lord who rules over all says , “ Think carefully about how you are living .
NIRV	Haggai	1	6	You have planted many seeds . But the crops you have gathered are small . So you eat . But you never have enough . You drink . But you are never full . You put on your clothes . But you are not warm . You earn your pay . But it will not buy everything you need. ”
NIRV	Haggai	1	7	He continues , “ Think carefully about how you are living .
NIRV	Haggai	1	8	Go up into the mountains . Bring logs down . Use them to rebuild the temple , my house . Then I will enjoy it . And you will honor me , ” says the Lord .
NIRV	Haggai	1	9	“ You expected a lot . But you can see what a small amount it turned out to be . I blew away what you brought home . I ’ ll tell you why , ” announces the Lord who rules over all . “ Because my temple is still destroyed . In spite of that , each one of you is busy with your own house .
NIRV	Haggai	1	10	So because of what you have done , the heavens have held back the dew . And the earth has not produced its crops .
NIRV	Haggai	1	11	I ordered the rain not to fall on the fields and mountains . Then the ground did not produce any grain . There were not enough grapes to make fresh wine . The trees did not bear enough olives to make oil . People and cattle suffered . All your hard work failed. ”
NIRV	Haggai	1	12	Zerubbabel was the son of Shealtiel . Joshua the high priest was the son of Jozadak . They obeyed the Lord their God . So did all the Lord ’ s people who were still left alive . The Lord had given his message to them through me . He had sent me to speak to them . And the people had respect for him .
NIRV	Haggai	1	13	Haggai was the Lord ’ s messenger . So Haggai gave the Lord ’ s message to the people . He told them , “ The Lord announces , ‘ I am with you. ’ ”
NIRV	Haggai	1	14	So the Lord stirred up the spirits of Zerubbabel , the governor of Judah , and Joshua the high priest . The Lord also stirred up the rest of the people to help them . Then everyone began to work on the temple of the Lord who rules over all . He is their God .

NIRV	Haggai	2	1	a second message came from the Lord . It came to Haggai the prophet . The message came on the 21st day of the seventh month . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Haggai	2	3	‘ Did any of you who are here see how beautiful this temple used to be ? How does it look to you now ? It doesn ’ t look so good , does it ?
NIRV	Haggai	2	4	But be strong , Zerubbabel , ’ announces the Lord . ‘ Be strong , Joshua . Be strong , all of you people in the land , ’ announces the Lord . ‘ Start rebuilding . I am with you , ’ announces the Lord who rules over all .
NIRV	Haggai	2	5	‘ That is what I promised you when you came out of Egypt . My Spirit continues to be with you . So do not be afraid. ’ ”
NIRV	Haggai	2	6	The Lord says , “ In a little while I will shake the heavens and the earth once more . I will also shake the ocean and the dry land .

NIRV	Haggai	2	11	The Lord who rules over all speaks . He says , “ Ask the priests what the law says .
NIRV	Haggai	2	12	Suppose someone carries holy meat in the clothes they are wearing . And the clothes touch some bread or stew . Or they touch some wine , olive oil or other food . Then do these things also become holy ? ” The priests answered , “ No. ”
NIRV	Haggai	2	13	So Haggai said , “ Suppose someone is made ‘ unclean ’ by touching a dead body . And then they touch one of these things . Does it become ‘ unclean ’ too ? ” “ Yes , ” the priests replied . “ It does. ”
NIRV	Haggai	2	14	Then here is what Haggai said . “ The Lord announces , ‘ That is how I look at these people and this nation . Anything they do and anything they sacrifice on the altar is “ unclean. ”
NIRV	Haggai	2	15	“ ‘ Think carefully about this from now on . Think about how things were before the Lord ’ s temple was built . This was before one stone was laid on top of another .
NIRV	Haggai	2	16	People went to get
NIRV	Haggai	2	20	A final message from the Lord came to Haggai . This message also came on the 24th day of the ninth month . The Lord said ,
NIRV	Haggai	2	50	measures . But only
NIRV	Haggai	2	17	You worked very hard to produce all those things . But I struck them with rot , mold and hail . And you still did not return to me , ’ announces the Lord .
NIRV	Haggai	2	18	It is the 24th day of the ninth month . From this day on , here is what you should think carefully about . Think about the day when the foundation of my temple was laid .

NIRV	Zechariah	1	1	A message from the Lord came to Zechariah the prophet . Zechariah was the son of Berekiah . Berekiah was the son of Iddo . It was the eighth month of the second year that Darius was king of Persia . Here is what Zechariah said .
NIRV	Zechariah	1	2	The Lord who rules over all was very angry with your people of long ago .
NIRV	Zechariah	1	3	And now he says to us , “ Return to me . Then I will return to you , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Zechariah	1	4	“ Do not be like your people of long ago . The earlier prophets gave them my message . I said , ‘ Stop doing what is evil . Turn away from your sinful practices. ’ But they would not listen to me . They would not pay any attention , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Zechariah	1	5	“ Where are those people now ? And what about my prophets ? Do they live forever ?
NIRV	Zechariah	1	6	I commanded my servants the prophets what to say . I told them what I planned to do . But your people refused to obey me . So I had to punish them . “ Then they had a change of heart . They said , ‘ The Lord who rules over all has punished us because of how we have lived . He was fair and right to do that . He has done to us just what he decided to do. ’ ” A Vision of a Horseman Among Some Myrtle Trees
NIRV	Zechariah	1	7	A message from the Lord came to Zechariah the prophet . Zechariah was the son of Berekiah . Berekiah was the son of Iddo . The message came during the second year that Darius was king . It was the 24th day of the 11th month . That ’ s the month of Shebat .
NIRV	Zechariah	1	8	I had a vision at night . I saw a man sitting on a red horse . He was standing among the myrtle trees in a valley . Behind him were red , brown and white horses .
NIRV	Zechariah	1	9	An angel was talking with me . I asked him , “ Sir , what are these ? ” He answered , “ I will show you what they are. ”
NIRV	Zechariah	1	10	Then the man standing among the myrtle trees spoke . He said , “ They are the messengers the Lord has sent out . He told them to go all through the earth. ”
NIRV	Zechariah	1	11	They brought a report to the angel of the Lord . He was standing among the myrtle trees . They said to him , “ We have gone all through the earth . We ’ ve found the whole world enjoying peace and rest. ”
NIRV	Zechariah	1	12	Then the angel of the Lord spoke up . He said , “ Lord , you rule over all . How long will you keep from showing your tender love to Jerusalem ? How long will you keep it from the towns of Judah ? You have been angry with them for
NIRV	Zechariah	1	70	years. ”
NIRV	Zechariah	1	13	So the Lord replied with kind and comforting words . He spoke them to the angel who talked with me .
NIRV	Zechariah	1	14	Then the angel said , “ Announce this message . Say , ‘ The Lord who rules over all says , “ I am very jealous for my people in Jerusalem and Zion .
NIRV	Zechariah	1	15	And I am very angry with the nations that feel secure . I was only a little angry with my people . But the nations went too far and tried to wipe them out. ”
NIRV	Zechariah	1	16	“ ‘ So the Lord says , “ I will return to Jerusalem . I will show its people my tender love . My temple will be rebuilt there . Workers will use a measuring line when they rebuild Jerusalem , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Zechariah	1	17	“ ‘ He says , “ My towns will be filled with good things once more . I will comfort Zion . And I will choose Jerusalem again. ” ’ ” A Vision of Four Horns and Four Skilled Workers
NIRV	Zechariah	1	18	Then I looked up and saw four animal horns .
NIRV	Zechariah	1	19	I spoke to the angel who was talking with me . “ What are these horns ? ” I asked . He said , “ They are the powerful nations that scattered Judah , Israel and Jerusalem. ”
NIRV	Zechariah	1	20	Then the Lord showed me four skilled workers .
NIRV	Zechariah	1	21	I asked , “ What are they coming to do ? ” He answered , “ The horns are the powerful nations that scattered the people of Judah . That made Judah helpless . But these four skilled workers have come to terrify the horns . The workers will destroy the power of those nations . Those nations had used their power to scatter Judah ’ s people. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Zechariah	2	2	“ Where are you going ? ” I asked . “ To measure Jerusalem , ” he answered . “ I want to find out how wide and how long it is. ”
NIRV	Zechariah	2	3	The angel who was talking with me was leaving . At that time , another angel came over to him .
NIRV	Zechariah	2	4	He said to him , “ Run ! Tell that young man Zechariah , ‘ Jerusalem will be a city that does not have any walls around it . It will have huge numbers of people and animals in it .
NIRV	Zechariah	2	5	And I myself will be like a wall of fire around it , ’ announces the Lord . ‘ I will be the city ’ s glory. ’
NIRV	Zechariah	2	6	“ Israel , I have scattered you , ” announces the Lord . “ I have used the power of the four winds of heaven to do it . Come quickly ! Run away from the land of the north , ” announces the Lord .
NIRV	Zechariah	2	7	“ Come , people of Zion ! Escape , you who live in Babylon ! ”
NIRV	Zechariah	2	8	The Lord rules over all . His angel says to Israel , “ The Glorious One has sent me to punish the nations that have robbed you of everything . That ’ s because anyone who hurts you hurts those the Lord loves and guards .
NIRV	Zechariah	2	9	So I will raise my powerful hand to strike down your enemies . Their own slaves will rob them of everything . Then you will know that the Lord who rules over all has sent me .
NIRV	Zechariah	2	10	“ ‘ People of Zion , shout and be glad ! I am coming to live among you , ’ announces the Lord .
NIRV	Zechariah	2	11	‘ At that time many nations will join themselves to me . And they will become my people . I will live among you , ’ says the Lord . Then you will know that the Lord who rules over all has sent me to you .
NIRV	Zechariah	2	12	He will receive Judah as his share in the holy land . And he will choose Jerusalem again .

NIRV	Zechariah	3	3	Joshua stood in front of the angel . He was wearing clothes that were very dirty .
NIRV	Zechariah	3	2	The Lord said to Satan , “ May the Lord correct you ! He has chosen Jerusalem . So may he correct you ! Isn ’ t this man Joshua like a burning stick pulled out of the fire ? ”
NIRV	Zechariah	3	4	The angel spoke to those who were standing near him . He said , “ Take his dirty clothes off. ” He said to Joshua , “ I have taken your sin away . I will put fine clothes on you. ”
NIRV	Zechariah	3	5	I added , “ Put a clean turban on his head. ” So they did . And they dressed him while the angel of the Lord stood by .

NIRV	Zechariah	4	4	I asked the angel who was talking with me , “ Sir , what are these ? ”
NIRV	Zechariah	4	2	“ What do you see ? ” he asked me . “ I see a solid gold lampstand , ” I answered . “ It has a bowl on top of it . There are seven lamps on it . Seven tubes lead to the lamps .
NIRV	Zechariah	4	3	There are two olive trees by the lampstand . One is on its right side . The other is on its left. ”
NIRV	Zechariah	4	5	He answered , “ Don ’ t you know what they are ? ” “ No , sir , ” I replied .
NIRV	Zechariah	4	6	So he said to me , “ A message from the Lord came to Zerubbabel . The Lord said , ‘ Your strength will not get my temple rebuilt . Your power will not do it either . Only the power of my Spirit will do it , ’ says the Lord who rules over all .
NIRV	Zechariah	4	7	“ So nothing can stop Zerubbabel from completing the temple . Even a mountain of problems will be smoothed out by him . When the temple is finished , he will put its most important stone in place . Then the people will shout , ‘ God bless it ! God bless it ! ’ ”
NIRV	Zechariah	4	8	Then a message from the Lord came to me . His angel said ,
NIRV	Zechariah	4	9	“ The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple . His hands will also complete it . Then you will know that the Lord who rules over all has sent me to you .

NIRV	Zechariah	4	11	Then I said to the angel , “ I see two olive trees . One is on the right side of the lampstand . The other is on the left . What are these trees ? ”
NIRV	Zechariah	4	12	I continued , “ I also see two olive branches . They are next to the two gold pipes that pour out golden olive oil . What are these branches ? ”
NIRV	Zechariah	4	13	He answered , “ Don ’ t you know what they are ? ” “ No , sir , ” I said .

NIRV	Zechariah	5	2	“ What do you see ? ” the angel asked me . “ A scroll flying in the air , ” I replied . “ It ’ s
NIRV	Zechariah	5	30	feet long and
NIRV	Zechariah	5	15	feet wide. ”
NIRV	Zechariah	5	3	He said to me , “ A curse sent by the Lord is written on it . It is going out over the whole land . Every thief will be driven out of the land .

NIRV	Zechariah	5	4	The Lord who rules over all announces , ‘ I will send the curse out . It will enter the house of the thief . It will also enter the house of anyone who lies when making a promise in my name . It will remain in that house and destroy it completely .

NIRV	Zechariah	5	6	“ What is it ? ” I asked . “ A basket , ” he replied . “ The sins of the people all through the land are in it. ”
NIRV	Zechariah	5	7	Then the basket ’ s cover was lifted up . It was made out of lead . A woman was sitting in the basket !
NIRV	Zechariah	5	8	The angel said , “ She stands for everything that is evil. ” Then he pushed her down into the basket . He put the lead cover back over it .
NIRV	Zechariah	5	9	I looked up and saw two other women . They had wings like the wings of a stork . A wind sent by the Lord carried them along . They lifted the basket up between heaven and earth .
NIRV	Zechariah	5	10	“ Where are they taking the basket ? ” I asked the angel .

NIRV	Zechariah	6	7	The powerful horses went out . They were in a hurry to go all over the earth . The angel said , “ Go all through the earth ! ” So they did .

NIRV	Zechariah	7	2	The people of Bethel wanted to ask the Lord for his blessing . So they sent Sharezer and Regem-Melek and their men .
NIRV	Zechariah	7	3	They went to the prophets and priests at the Lord ’ s temple . They asked them , “ Should we mourn and go without eating in the fifth month ? That ’ s what we ’ ve done for many years. ”
NIRV	Zechariah	7	4	Then the message came to me from the Lord who rules over all . He said ,
NIRV	Zechariah	7	5	“ Ask the priests and all the people in the land a question for me . Say to them , ‘ You mourned and fasted in the fifth and seventh months . You did it for the past
NIRV	Zechariah	7	70	years . But did you really do it for me ?
NIRV	Zechariah	7	6	And when you were eating and drinking , weren ’ t you just enjoying good food for yourselves ?
NIRV	Zechariah	7	8	Another message from the Lord came to me .
NIRV	Zechariah	7	9	Here is what the Lord who rules over all said to his people . “ Treat everyone with justice . Show mercy and tender concern to one another .
NIRV	Zechariah	7	10	Do not take advantage of widows . Do not mistreat children whose fathers have died . Do not be mean to outsiders or poor people . Do not make evil plans against one another. ”
NIRV	Zechariah	7	11	But they refused to pay attention to the Lord . They were stubborn . They turned their backs and covered their ears .
NIRV	Zechariah	7	12	They made their hearts as hard as the hardest stone . They wouldn ’ t listen to the law . They wouldn ’ t pay attention to the Lord ’ s messages . So the Lord who rules over all was very angry . After all , his Spirit had spoken to his people through the earlier prophets .
NIRV	Zechariah	7	13	“ When I called , they did not listen , ” says the Lord . “ So when they called , I would not listen .
NIRV	Zechariah	7	14	I used a windstorm to scatter them among all the nations . They were strangers there . The land they left behind became dry and empty . No one could even travel through it . This is how they turned the pleasant land into a dry and empty desert. ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Zechariah	8	7	He continued , “ I will save my people . I will gather them from the countries of the east and the west .
NIRV	Zechariah	8	9	The Lord who rules over all says to his people , “ Now listen to these words , ‘ Let your hands be strong so that you can rebuild the temple. ’ This also was said by the prophets Haggai and Zechariah . They spoke to you when the work on my temple began again .
NIRV	Zechariah	8	10	Before the work was started again , there was no pay for the people . And there was no money to rent animals . People could not go about their business safely because of their enemies . I had turned all of them against one another .

NIRV	Zechariah	8	19	“ You have established special times to go without eating . They are your fasts in the fourth , fifth , seventh and tenth months . They will become days of joy . They will be happy times for Judah . It will happen if you take delight in telling the truth and bringing about peace. ”
NIRV	Zechariah	8	20	He continued , “ Many nations will still come to you . And those who live in many cities will also come .
NIRV	Zechariah	8	21	The people who live in one city will go to another city . They will say , ‘ Let ’ s go right away to ask the Lord for his blessing . Let ’ s look to him as our God . We ourselves are going. ’

NIRV	Zechariah	10	7	The people of Ephraim will become like warriors . Their hearts will be glad as if they were drinking wine . Their children will see it and be filled with joy . I will make their hearts glad .
NIRV	Zechariah	10	8	I will signal for my people to come , and I will gather them in . I will set them free . There will be as many of them as before .
NIRV	Zechariah	10	9	I have scattered them among the nations . But in lands far away they will remember me . They and their children will be kept alive . And they will return .
NIRV	Zechariah	10	11	They will pass through a sea of trouble . The stormy sea will calm down . All the deep places in the Nile River will dry up . Assyria ’ s pride will be brought down . Egypt ’ s right to rule will disappear .

NIRV	Zechariah	11	11	It happened that day . The sheep that had been treated badly were watching me . They knew it was the Lord ’ s message .
NIRV	Zechariah	11	2	Juniper trees , cry out ! The cedar trees have fallen down . The majestic trees are destroyed . Cry out , you oak trees of Bashan ! The thick forest has been cut down .
NIRV	Zechariah	11	3	Listen to the shepherds cry out ! Their rich grasslands are destroyed . Listen to the lions roar ! The trees and bushes along the Jordan River are gone . The Two Shepherds
NIRV	Zechariah	11	4	The Lord my God says , “ Take care of the sheep that are set apart to be sacrificed .
NIRV	Zechariah	11	5	Those who buy them kill them . And they are not punished for it . Those who sell them say , ‘ Praise the Lord ! We ’ re rich ! ’ And their own shepherds do not spare them .
NIRV	Zechariah	11	6	I will no longer have pity on the people in the land , ” announces the Lord . “ I will hand all of them over to their neighbors and their king . They will destroy the land . And I will not save anyone from their power. ”
NIRV	Zechariah	11	7	So I took care of the sheep set apart to be sacrificed . I took special care of those that had been treated badly . Then I got two shepherd ’ s staffs . I called one of them Favor . I called the other one Union . And I took care of the flock .
NIRV	Zechariah	11	8	In one month I got rid of three worthless shepherds . The sheep hated me , and I got tired of them .
NIRV	Zechariah	11	9	So I said , “ I won ’ t be your shepherd anymore . Let those of you who are dying die . Let those who are passing away pass away . Let those who are left eat one another up. ”
NIRV	Zechariah	11	10	Then I got my staff called Favor . I broke it . That meant the covenant the Lord had made with all the nations was broken .
NIRV	Zechariah	11	12	I told them , “ If you think it is best , give me my pay . But if you don ’ t think so , keep it. ” So they paid me
NIRV	Zechariah	11	30	silver coins to the potter at the Lord ’ s temple .
NIRV	Zechariah	11	13	The Lord said to me , “ Throw those coins to the potter. ” That amount shows how little they valued me ! So I threw the
NIRV	Zechariah	11	14	Then I broke my second staff called Union . That broke the family connection between Judah and Israel .
NIRV	Zechariah	11	15	The Lord said to me , “ Now pretend to be a foolish shepherd . Get the things you need .
NIRV	Zechariah	11	16	I am going to raise up a shepherd over the land . He will not take care of those that are wounded . He will not look for the young ones . He will not heal those that are hurt . He will not feed the healthy ones . Instead , he will eat the best sheep . He will even tear their hooves off .
NIRV	Zechariah	11	17	“ How terrible it will be for that worthless shepherd ! He deserts the flock . May a sword strike his arm and his right eye ! May his powerful arm become weak ! May his right eye be totally blinded ! ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Zechariah	12	12	Everyone in the land will mourn . Each family will mourn by themselves and their wives by themselves . That will include the family lines of David , Nathan ,
NIRV	Zechariah	12	2	“ Jerusalem will be like a cup in my hand . It will make all the surrounding nations drunk from the wine of my anger . Judah will be attacked by its enemies . So will Jerusalem .
NIRV	Zechariah	12	3	At that time all the nations on earth will gather together against Jerusalem . Then it will become like a rock that can ’ t be moved . All the nations that try to move it will only hurt themselves .
NIRV	Zechariah	12	4	On that day I will fill every horse with panic . I will make every rider crazy , ” announces the Lord . “ I will watch over the people of Judah . But I will make all the horses of the nations blind .
NIRV	Zechariah	12	5	Then the family groups of Judah will say in their hearts , ‘ The people of Jerusalem are strong . That ’ s because the Lord who rules over all is their God. ’
NIRV	Zechariah	12	6	“ At that time Judah ’ s family groups will be like a fire pot in a pile of wood . They will be like a burning torch among bundles of grain . They will destroy all the surrounding nations on every side . But Jerusalem will remain unharmed in its place .
NIRV	Zechariah	12	7	“ I will save the houses in Judah first . The honor of David ’ s family line is great . So is the honor of those who live in Jerusalem . But their honor will not be greater than the honor of the rest of Judah .
NIRV	Zechariah	12	8	At that time I will be like a shield to those who live in Jerusalem . Then even the weakest among them will be great warriors like David . And David ’ s family line will be like the angel of the Lord who leads them .
NIRV	Zechariah	12	9	On that day I will begin to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem . Israel ’ s People Will Mourn Over the One They Pierced
NIRV	Zechariah	12	10	“ I will pour out a spirit of grace and prayer on David ’ s family line . I will also send it on those who live in Jerusalem . They will look to me . I am the one they have pierced . They will mourn over me as someone mourns over an only child who has died . They will be full of sorrow over me . Their sorrow will be just like someone ’ s sorrow over an oldest son .
NIRV	Zechariah	12	11	At that time there will be a lot of weeping in Jerusalem . It will be as great as the weeping of the people at Hadad Rimmon . Hadad Rimmon is in the valley of Megiddo . They were weeping over Josiah ’ s death .

NIRV	Zechariah	13	13	“ At that time a fountain will be opened for the benefit of David ’ s family line . It will also bless the others who live in Jerusalem . It will wash away their sins . It will make them pure and ‘ clean. ’
NIRV	Zechariah	13	2	“ On that day I will remove the names of other gods from the land . They will not even be remembered anymore , ” announces the Lord who rules over all . “ I will drive the evil prophets out of the land . I will get rid of the spirit that put lies in their mouths .
NIRV	Zechariah	13	3	Some people might still prophesy . But their own fathers and mothers will speak to them . They will tell them , ‘ You must die . You have told lies in the Lord ’ s name. ’ When they prophesy , their own parents will stab them .
NIRV	Zechariah	13	4	“ At that time every prophet will be ashamed of the vision they see . They will no longer pretend to be a true prophet . They will not put on clothes that are made out of hair in order to trick people .
NIRV	Zechariah	13	5	In fact , each one will say , ‘ I ’ m not really a prophet . I ’ m a farmer . I ’ ve farmed the land since I was young. ’
NIRV	Zechariah	13	6	Suppose someone asks , ‘ What are these wounds on your body ? ’ Then they will answer , ‘ I was given these wounds at the house of my friends. ’ The Good Shepherd Is Killed and the Sheep Are Scattered
NIRV	Zechariah	13	7	“ My sword , wake up ! Attack my shepherd ! Attack the man who is close to me , ” announces the Lord who rules over all . “ Strike down the shepherd . Then the sheep will be scattered . And I will turn my hand against their little ones .
NIRV	Zechariah	13	8	Here is what will happen in the whole land , ” announces the Lord . “ Two-thirds of the people will be struck down and die . But one-third will be left .
NIRV	Zechariah	13	9	I will put this third in the fire . I will make them as pure as silver . I will test them like gold . They will call out to me . And I will answer them . I will say , ‘ They are my people. ’ And they will say , ‘ The Lord is our God. ’ ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Zechariah	14	14	Judah will also fight at Jerusalem . The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected . Huge amounts of gold , silver and clothes will be gathered up .
NIRV	Zechariah	14	2	The Lord will gather all the nations together . They will fight against Jerusalem . They ’ ll capture the city . Its houses will be robbed . Its women will be raped . Half of the people will be taken away as prisoners . But the rest of them won ’ t be taken .
NIRV	Zechariah	14	3	Then the Lord will march out and fight against those nations . He will fight as on a day of battle .
NIRV	Zechariah	14	4	On that day he will stand on the Mount of Olives . It ’ s east of Jerusalem . It will be split in two from east to west . Half of the mountain will move north . The other half will move south . A large valley will be formed .
NIRV	Zechariah	14	5	The people will run away through that mountain valley . It will reach all the way to Azel . They ’ ll run away just as they ran from the earthquake when Uzziah was king of Judah . Then the Lord my God will come . All the holy ones will come with him .

NIRV	Zechariah	14	7	It will be a day unlike any other . It will be a day known only to the Lord . It won ’ t be separated into day and night . After that day is over , there will be light again .
NIRV	Zechariah	14	8	At that time water that gives life will flow out from Jerusalem . Half of it will run east into the Dead Sea . The other half will go west to the Mediterranean Sea . The water will flow in summer and winter .
NIRV	Zechariah	14	9	The Lord will be king over the whole earth . On that day there will be one Lord . His name will be the only name .
NIRV	Zechariah	14	10	The whole land south of Jerusalem will be changed . From Geba to Rimmon it will become like the Arabah Valley . But Jerusalem will be raised up high . It will be raised from the Benjamin Gate to the First Gate to the Corner Gate . It will be raised from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses . And it will remain in its place .
NIRV	Zechariah	14	11	People will live in it . Jerusalem will never be destroyed again . It will be secure .
NIRV	Zechariah	14	12	The Lord will punish all the nations that fought against Jerusalem . He ’ ll strike them with a plague . It will make their bodies rot while they are still standing on their feet . Their eyes will rot in their heads . Their tongues will rot in their mouths .
NIRV	Zechariah	14	13	On that day the Lord will fill people with great panic . They will grab one another by the hand . And they ’ ll attack one another .
NIRV	Zechariah	14	15	The same kind of plague will strike the horses , mules , camels and donkeys . In fact , it will strike all the animals in the army camps .
NIRV	Zechariah	14	16	But some people from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem will still be left alive . All of them will go up there to worship the King . He is the Lord who rules over all . Year after year these people will celebrate the Feast of Booths .
NIRV	Zechariah	14	17	Some nations might not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King . If they don ’ t , they won ’ t have any rain .
NIRV	Zechariah	14	18	The people of Egypt might not go up there to take part . Then they won ’ t have any rain either . That ’ s the plague the Lord will send on the nations that don ’ t go to celebrate the Feast of Booths .
NIRV	Zechariah	14	19	Egypt will be punished . So will all the other nations that don ’ t celebrate the feast .
NIRV	Zechariah	14	20	On that day “ Holy to the Lord ” will be carved on the bells of the horses . The cooking pots in the Lord ’ s temple will be just like the sacred bowls in front of the altar for burnt offerings .

NIRV	Malachi	1	1	This is a prophecy . It is the Lord ’ s message to Israel through Malachi . Israel Doubts God ’ s Love
NIRV	Malachi	1	2	“ Israel , I have loved you , ” says the Lord . “ But you ask , ‘ How have you loved us ? ’ “ Wasn ’ t Esau Jacob ’ s brother ? ” says the Lord . “ But I chose Jacob
NIRV	Malachi	1	3	instead of Esau . I have turned Esau ’ s hill country into a dry and empty land . I left that land of Edom to the wild dogs in the desert. ”
NIRV	Malachi	1	4	Edom might say , “ We have been crushed . But we ’ ll rebuild our cities. ” The Lord who rules over all says , “ They might rebuild their cities . But I will destroy them . They will be called the Evil Land . My anger will always remain on them .
NIRV	Malachi	1	5	You will see it with your own eyes . You will say , ‘ The Lord is great ! He rules even beyond the borders of Israel ! ’ Give Your Best to the Lord
NIRV	Malachi	1	6	“ A son honors his father . A slave honors his master . If I am a father , where is the honor I should have ? If I am a master , where is the respect you should give me ? ” says the Lord who rules over all . “ You priests look down on me . “ But you ask , ‘ How have we looked down on you ? ’
NIRV	Malachi	1	7	“ You sacrifice ‘ unclean ’ food on my altar . “ But you ask , ‘ How have we made you “ unclean ” ? ’ “ You do it by looking down on my altar .
NIRV	Malachi	1	8	You sacrifice blind animals to me . Isn ’ t that wrong ? You sacrifice disabled or sick animals . Isn ’ t that wrong ? Try offering them to your governor ! Would he be pleased with you ? Would he accept you ? ” says the Lord who rules over all .
NIRV	Malachi	1	9	“ Now plead with God to be gracious to us ! But as long as you give offerings like those , how can he accept you ? ” says the Lord .
NIRV	Malachi	1	10	“ You might as well shut the temple doors ! Then you would not light useless fires on my altar . I am not pleased with you , ” says the Lord . “ I will not accept any of the offerings you bring .
NIRV	Malachi	1	11	My name will be great among the nations . They will worship me from where the sun rises in the east to where it sets in the west . In every place , incense and pure offerings will be brought to me . That ’ s because my name will be great among the nations , ” says the Lord .
NIRV	Malachi	1	12	“ But you treat my name as if it were not holy . You say the Lord ’ s altar is ‘ unclean. ’ And you look down on its food .
NIRV	Malachi	1	13	You say , ‘ What a heavy load our work is ! ’ And you turn up your nose . You act as if you hate working for me , ” says the Lord who rules over all . “ You bring animals that have been hurt . Or you bring disabled or sick animals . Then you dare to offer them to me as sacrifices ! Should I accept them from you ? ” says the Lord .
NIRV	Malachi	1	14	“ Suppose you have a male sheep or goat that does not have any flaws . And you promise to offer it to me . But then you sacrifice an animal that has flaws . When you do that , you cheat me . And anyone who cheats me is under my curse . After all , I am a great king , ” says the Lord who rules over all . “ The other nations have respect for my name .

NIRV	Malachi	2	2	Listen to it . Honor me with all your heart , ” says the Lord who rules over all . “ If you do not , I will send a curse on you . I will turn your blessings into curses . In fact , I have already done that because you have not honored me with all your heart .
NIRV	Malachi	2	3	“ Because of what you have done , I will punish your children . I will smear the waste from your sacrifices on your faces . And you will be carried off to the dump along with it .
NIRV	Malachi	2	4	You will know that I have given you this warning . I have warned you so that my covenant with Levi will continue , ” says the Lord who rules over all .
NIRV	Malachi	2	5	“ My covenant promised Levi life and peace . So I gave them to him . I required him to respect me . And he had great respect for my name .
NIRV	Malachi	2	6	True teaching came from his mouth . Nothing but the truth came from his lips . He walked with me in peace . He did what was right . He turned many people away from their sins .
NIRV	Malachi	2	7	“ The lips of a priest should guard knowledge . After all , he is the messenger of the Lord who rules over all . And people seek instruction from his mouth .
NIRV	Malachi	2	8	But you have turned away from the right path . Your teaching has caused many people to trip and fall . You have broken my covenant with Levi , ” says the Lord who rules over all .
NIRV	Malachi	2	9	“ So I have caused all the people to hate you . They have lost respect for you . You have not done what I told you to do . Instead , you have favored one person over another in matters of the law. ” Breaking the Covenant Through Divorce
NIRV	Malachi	2	10	People of Judah , all of us have one Father . One God created us . So why do we break the covenant the Lord made with our people of long ago ? We do this by being unfaithful to one another .
NIRV	Malachi	2	11	And Judah has been unfaithful . A hateful thing has been done in Israel and Jerusalem . The Lord loves his temple . But Judah has made it impure . Their men have married women who worship other gods .
NIRV	Malachi	2	12	May the Lord punish the man who marries a woman like this . It doesn ’ t matter who that man is . May the Lord who rules over all remove him from the tents of Jacob ’ s people . May the Lord remove him even if he brings an offering to him .
NIRV	Malachi	2	13	Here ’ s something else you do . You flood the Lord ’ s altar with your tears . You weep and cry because your offerings don ’ t please him anymore . He doesn ’ t accept them with pleasure from your hands .
NIRV	Malachi	2	14	You ask , “ Why ? ” It ’ s because the Lord is holding you responsible . He watches how you treat the wife you married when you were young . You have been unfaithful to her . You did it even though she ’ s your partner . You promised to stay married to her . And the Lord was a witness to it .
NIRV	Malachi	2	15	Hasn ’ t the one God made the two of you one also ? Both of you belong to him in body and spirit . And why has the one God made you one ? Because he wants his children to be like him . So be careful . Don ’ t be unfaithful to the wife you married when you were young .
NIRV	Malachi	2	16	“ Suppose a man hates and divorces his wife , ” says the Lord God of Israel . “ Then he is harming the one he should protect , ” says the Lord who rules over all . So be careful . And don ’ t be unfaithful . Breaking the Covenant by Treating Others Unfairly
NIRV	Malachi	2	17	You have worn out the Lord by what you keep saying . “ How have we worn him out ? ” you ask . You have done it by saying , “ All those who do evil things are good in the Lord ’ s sight . And he is pleased with them. ” Or you ask , “ Is God really fair ? ” Copyright ©

NIRV	Malachi	3	3	He will act like one who makes silver pure . And he will purify the Levites , just as gold and silver are purified with fire . Then these men will bring proper offerings to the Lord .
NIRV	Malachi	3	2	But who can live through the day when he comes ? Who will be left standing when he appears ? He will be like a fire that makes things pure . He will be like soap that makes things clean .
NIRV	Malachi	3	4	And the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable to him . It will be as it was in days and years gone by .
NIRV	Malachi	3	5	“ So I will come and put you on trial . I will be quick to bring charges against all of you , ” says the Lord who rules over all . “ I will bring charges against you sinful people who do not have any respect for me . That includes those who practice evil magic . It includes those who commit adultery and those who tell lies in court . It includes those who cheat workers out of their pay . It includes those who treat widows badly . It also includes those who mistreat children whose fathers have died . And it includes those who take away the rights of outsiders in the courts . Breaking the Covenant by Stealing From God
NIRV	Malachi	3	6	“ I am the Lord . I do not change . That is why I have not destroyed you members of Jacob ’ s family .
NIRV	Malachi	3	7	You have turned away from my rules . You have not obeyed them . You have lived that way ever since the days of your people of long ago . Return to me . Then I will return to you , ” says the Lord who rules over all . “ But you ask , ‘ How can we return ? ’
NIRV	Malachi	3	8	“ Will a mere human being dare to steal from God ? But you rob me ! “ You ask , ‘ How are we robbing you ? ’ “ By holding back your offerings . You also steal from me when you do not bring me a tenth of everything you produce .
NIRV	Malachi	3	9	So you are under my curse . In fact , your whole nation is under my curse . That is because you are robbing me .
NIRV	Malachi	3	10	Bring the entire tenth to the storerooms in my temple . Then there will be plenty of food . Test me this way , ” says the Lord . “ Then you will see that I will throw open the windows of heaven . I will pour out so many blessings that you will not have enough room to store them .
NIRV	Malachi	3	11	I will keep bugs from eating up your crops . And your grapes will not drop from the vines before they are ripe , ” says the Lord .
NIRV	Malachi	3	12	“ Then all the nations will call you blessed . Your land will be delightful , ” says the Lord who rules over all . Israel Speaks With Pride Against the Lord
NIRV	Malachi	3	13	“ You have spoken with pride against me , ” says the Lord . “ But you ask , ‘ What have we spoken against you ? ’
NIRV	Malachi	3	14	“ You have said , ‘ It is useless to serve God . What do we gain by obeying his laws ? And what do we get by pretending to be sad in front of the Lord ?
NIRV	Malachi	3	15	But now we call proud people blessed . Things go well with those who do what is evil . And God doesn ’ t even punish those who test him. ’ ” Those Who Respect the Lord
NIRV	Malachi	3	16	Those who had respect for the Lord talked with one another . And the Lord heard them . A list of people and what they did was written in a book in front of him . It included the names of those who respected the Lord and honored him .
NIRV	Malachi	3	17	“ The day is coming when I will judge , ” says the Lord who rules over all . “ On that day they will be my special treasure . I will spare them just as a father loves and spares his son who serves him .
NIRV	Malachi	3	18	Then once again you will see the difference between godly people and sinful people . And you will see the difference between those who serve me and those who do not . Copyright ©
