KJV	Matthew	1	1	The book of the generation of Jesus Christ , the son of David , the son of Abraham .
KJV	Matthew	1	2	Abraham begat Isaac ; and Isaac begat Jacob ; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren ;
KJV	Matthew	1	3	And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar ; and Phares begat Esrom ; and Esrom begat Aram ;
KJV	Matthew	1	4	And Aram begat Aminadab ; and Aminadab begat Naasson ; and Naasson begat Salmon ;
KJV	Matthew	1	5	And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab ; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth ; and Obed begat Jesse ;
KJV	Matthew	1	6	And Jesse begat David the king ; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias ;
KJV	Matthew	1	7	And Solomon begat Roboam ; and Roboam begat Abia ; and Abia begat Asa ;
KJV	Matthew	1	8	And Asa begat Josaphat ; and Josaphat begat Joram ; and Joram begat Ozias ;
KJV	Matthew	1	9	And Ozias begat Joatham ; and Joatham begat Achaz ; and Achaz begat Ezekias ;
KJV	Matthew	1	10	And Ezekias begat Manasses ; and Manasses begat Amon ; and Amon begat Josias ;
KJV	Matthew	1	11	And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren , about the time they were carried away to Babylon :
KJV	Matthew	1	12	And after they were brought to Babylon , Jechonias begat Salathiel ; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel ;
KJV	Matthew	1	13	And Zorobabel begat Abiud ; and Abiud begat Eliakim ; and Eliakim begat Azor ;
KJV	Matthew	1	14	And Azor begat Sadoc ; and Sadoc begat Achim ; and Achim begat Eliud ;
KJV	Matthew	1	15	And Eliud begat Eleazar ; and Eleazar begat Matthan ; and Matthan begat Jacob ;
KJV	Matthew	1	16	And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
KJV	Matthew	1	17	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations .
KJV	Matthew	1	18	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise : When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph , before they came together , she was found with child of the Holy Ghost .
KJV	Matthew	1	19	Then Joseph her husband , being a just man , and not willing to make her a public example , was minded to put her away privily .
KJV	Matthew	1	20	But while he thought on these things , behold , the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream , saying , Joseph , thou son of David , fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife : for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost .
KJV	Matthew	1	21	And she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name Jesus : for he shall save his people from their sins .
KJV	Matthew	1	22	Now all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying ,
KJV	Matthew	1	23	Behold , a virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , and they shall call his name Emmanuel , which being interpreted is , God with us .
KJV	Matthew	1	24	Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him , and took unto him his wife :
KJV	Matthew	1	25	And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son : and he called his name Jesus .
KJV	Matthew	2	2	Saying , Where is he that is born King of the Jews ? for we have seen his star in the east , and are come to worship him .
KJV	Matthew	2	3	When Herod the king had heard these things , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
KJV	Matthew	2	4	And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together , he demanded of them where Christ should be born .
KJV	Matthew	2	5	And they said unto him , In Bethlehem of Judaea : for thus it is written by the prophet ,
KJV	Matthew	2	6	And thou Bethlehem , in the land of Juda , art not the least among the princes of Juda : for out of thee shall come a Governor , that shall rule my people Israel .
KJV	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod , when he had privily called the wise men , enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared .
KJV	Matthew	2	8	And he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , Go and search diligently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also .
KJV	Matthew	2	9	When they had heard the king , they departed ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was .
KJV	Matthew	2	10	When they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
KJV	Matthew	2	11	And when they were come into the house , they saw the young child with Mary his mother , and fell down , and worshipped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented unto him gifts ; gold , and frankincense and myrrh .
KJV	Matthew	2	12	And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod , they departed into their own country another way .
KJV	Matthew	2	13	And when they were departed , behold , the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream , saying , Arise , and take the young child and his mother , and flee into Egypt , and be thou there until I bring thee word : for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him .
KJV	Matthew	2	14	When he arose , he took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt :
KJV	Matthew	2	15	And was there until the death of Herod : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying , Out of Egypt have I called my son .
KJV	Matthew	2	16	Then Herod , when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men , was exceeding wroth , and sent forth , and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem , and in all the coasts thereof , from two years old and under , according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men .
KJV	Matthew	2	17	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet , saying ,
KJV	Matthew	2	18	In Rama was there a voice heard , lamentation , and weeping , and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children , and would not be comforted , because they are not .
KJV	Matthew	2	19	But when Herod was dead , behold , an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt ,
KJV	Matthew	2	20	Saying , Arise , and take the young child and his mother , and go into the land of Israel : for they are dead which sought the young child 's life .
KJV	Matthew	2	21	And he arose , and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
KJV	Matthew	2	22	But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod , he was afraid to go thither : notwithstanding , being warned of God in a dream , he turned aside into the parts of Galilee :
KJV	Matthew	2	23	And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets , He shall be called a Nazarene .
KJV	Matthew	3	3	For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias , saying , The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight .
KJV	Matthew	3	2	And saying , Repent ye : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
KJV	Matthew	3	4	And the same John had his raiment of camel 's hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins ; and his meat was locusts and wild honey .
KJV	Matthew	3	5	Then went out to him Jerusalem , and all Judaea , and all the region round about Jordan ,
KJV	Matthew	3	6	And were baptized of him in Jordan , confessing their sins .
KJV	Matthew	3	7	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism , he said unto them , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
KJV	Matthew	3	8	Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance :
KJV	Matthew	3	9	And think not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
KJV	Matthew	3	10	And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
KJV	Matthew	3	11	I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance . but he that cometh after me is mightier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to bear : he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost , and with fire :
KJV	Matthew	3	12	Whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and gather his wheat into the garner ; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire .
KJV	Matthew	3	13	Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John , to be baptized of him .
KJV	Matthew	3	14	But John forbad him , saying , I have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me ?
KJV	Matthew	3	15	And Jesus answering said unto him , Suffer it to be so now : for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . Then he suffered him .
KJV	Matthew	3	16	And Jesus , when he was baptized , went up straightway out of the water : and , lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove , and lighting upon him :
KJV	Matthew	3	17	And lo a voice from heaven , saying , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
KJV	Matthew	4	4	But he answered and said , It is written , Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God .
KJV	Matthew	4	2	And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights , he was afterward an hungred .
KJV	Matthew	4	3	And when the tempter came to him , he said , If thou be the Son of God , command that these stones be made bread .
KJV	Matthew	4	5	Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city , and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple ,
KJV	Matthew	4	6	And saith unto him , If thou be the Son of God , cast thyself down : for it is written , He shall give his angels charge concerning thee : and in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone .
KJV	Matthew	4	7	Jesus said unto him , It is written again , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
KJV	Matthew	4	8	Again , the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain , and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of them ;
KJV	Matthew	4	9	And saith unto him , All these things will I give thee , if thou wilt fall down and worship me .
KJV	Matthew	4	10	Then saith Jesus unto him , Get thee hence , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
KJV	Matthew	4	11	Then the devil leaveth him , and , behold , angels came and ministered unto him .
KJV	Matthew	4	12	Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison , he departed into Galilee ;
KJV	Matthew	4	13	And leaving Nazareth , he came and dwelt in Capernaum , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim :
KJV	Matthew	4	14	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet , saying ,
KJV	Matthew	4	15	The land of Zabulon , and the land of Nephthalim , by the way of the sea , beyond Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles ;
KJV	Matthew	4	16	The people which sat in darkness saw great light ; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up .
KJV	Matthew	4	17	From that time Jesus began to preach , and to say , Repent : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
KJV	Matthew	4	18	And Jesus , walking by the sea of Galilee , saw two brethren , Simon called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
KJV	Matthew	4	19	And he saith unto them , Follow me , and I will make you fishers of men .
KJV	Matthew	4	20	And they straightway left their nets , and followed him .
KJV	Matthew	4	21	And going on from thence , he saw other two brethren , James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , in a ship with Zebedee their father , mending their nets ; and he called them .
KJV	Matthew	4	22	And they immediately left the ship and their father , and followed him .
KJV	Matthew	4	23	And Jesus went about all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people .
KJV	Matthew	4	24	And his fame went throughout all Syria : and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments , and those which were possessed with devils , and those which were lunatick , and those that had the palsy ; and he healed them .
KJV	Matthew	4	25	And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee , and from Decapolis , and from Jerusalem , and from Judaea , and from beyond Jordan .
KJV	Matthew	5	5	Blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth .
KJV	Matthew	5	2	And he opened his mouth , and taught them , saying ,
KJV	Matthew	5	3	Blessed are the poor in spirit : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
KJV	Matthew	5	4	Blessed are they that mourn : for they shall be comforted .
KJV	Matthew	5	6	Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled .
KJV	Matthew	5	7	Blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy .
KJV	Matthew	5	8	Blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see God .
KJV	Matthew	5	9	Blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be called the children of God .
KJV	Matthew	5	10	Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness ' sake : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
KJV	Matthew	5	11	Blessed are ye , when men shall revile you , and persecute you , and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my sake .
KJV	Matthew	5	12	Rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you .
KJV	Matthew	5	13	Ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be salted ? it is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be trodden under foot of men .
KJV	Matthew	5	14	Ye are the light of the world . A city that is set on an hill can not be hid .
KJV	Matthew	5	15	Neither do men light a candle , and put it under a bushel , but on a candlestick ; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house .
KJV	Matthew	5	16	Let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father which is in heaven .
KJV	Matthew	5	17	Think not that I am come to destroy the law , or the prophets : I am not come to destroy , but to fulfil .
KJV	Matthew	5	18	For verily I say unto you , Till heaven and earth pass , one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law , till all be fulfilled .
KJV	Matthew	5	19	Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments , and shall teach men so , he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven : but whosoever shall do and teach them , the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
KJV	Matthew	5	20	For I say unto you , That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven .
KJV	Matthew	5	21	Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time , Thou shalt not kill ; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment :
KJV	Matthew	5	22	But I say unto you , That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment : and whosoever shall say to his brother , Raca , shall be in danger of the council : but whosoever shall say , Thou fool , shall be in danger of hell fire .
KJV	Matthew	5	23	Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar , and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee ;
KJV	Matthew	5	24	Leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way ; first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift .
KJV	Matthew	5	25	Agree with thine adversary quickly , whiles thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
KJV	Matthew	5	26	Verily I say unto thee , Thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing .
KJV	Matthew	5	27	Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time , Thou shalt not commit adultery :
KJV	Matthew	5	28	But I say unto you , That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart .
KJV	Matthew	5	29	And if thy right eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
KJV	Matthew	5	30	And if thy right hand offend thee , cut it off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
KJV	Matthew	5	31	It hath been said , Whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorcement :
KJV	Matthew	5	32	But I say unto you , That whosoever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of fornication , causeth her to commit adultery : and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery .
KJV	Matthew	5	33	Again , ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time , Thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths :
KJV	Matthew	5	34	But I say unto you , Swear not at all ; neither by heaven ; for it is God 's throne :
KJV	Matthew	5	35	Nor by the earth ; for it is his footstool : neither by Jerusalem ; for it is the city of the great King .
KJV	Matthew	5	36	Neither shalt thou swear by thy head , because thou canst not make one hair white or black .
KJV	Matthew	5	37	But let your communication be , Yea , yea ; Nay , nay : for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil .
KJV	Matthew	5	38	Ye have heard that it hath been said , An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth :
KJV	Matthew	5	39	But I say unto you , That ye resist not evil : but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also .
KJV	Matthew	5	40	And if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away thy coat , let him have thy cloak also .
KJV	Matthew	5	41	And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile , go with him twain .
KJV	Matthew	5	42	Give to him that asketh thee , and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away .
KJV	Matthew	5	43	Ye have heard that it hath been said , Thou shalt love thy neighbour , and hate thine enemy .
KJV	Matthew	5	44	But I say unto you , Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you , and persecute you ;
KJV	Matthew	5	45	That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven : for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust .
KJV	Matthew	5	46	For if ye love them which love you , what reward have ye ? do not even the publicans the same ?
KJV	Matthew	5	47	And if ye salute your brethren only , what do ye more than others ? do not even the publicans so ?
KJV	Matthew	5	48	Be ye therefore perfect , even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect .
KJV	Matthew	6	6	But thou , when thou prayest , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy door , pray to thy Father which is in secret ; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly .
KJV	Matthew	6	2	Therefore when thou doest thine alms , do not sound a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may have glory of men . Verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
KJV	Matthew	6	3	But when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth :
KJV	Matthew	6	4	That thine alms may be in secret : and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly .
KJV	Matthew	6	5	And when thou prayest , thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are : for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen of men . Verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
KJV	Matthew	6	7	But when ye pray , use not vain repetitions , as the heathen do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
KJV	Matthew	6	8	Be not ye therefore like unto them : for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of , before ye ask him .
KJV	Matthew	6	9	After this manner therefore pray ye : Our Father which art in heaven , Hallowed be thy name .
KJV	Matthew	6	10	Thy kingdom come , Thy will be done in earth , as it is in heaven .
KJV	Matthew	6	11	Give us this day our daily bread .
KJV	Matthew	6	12	And forgive us our debts , as we forgive our debtors .
KJV	Matthew	6	13	And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil : For thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever . Amen .
KJV	Matthew	6	14	For if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you :
KJV	Matthew	6	15	But if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses .
KJV	Matthew	6	16	Moreover when ye fast , be not , as the hypocrites , of a sad countenance : for they disfigure their faces , that they may appear unto men to fast . Verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
KJV	Matthew	6	17	But thou , when thou fastest , anoint thine head , and wash thy face ;
KJV	Matthew	6	18	That thou appear not unto men to fast , but unto thy Father which is in secret : and thy Father , which seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly .
KJV	Matthew	6	19	Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth , where moth and rust doth corrupt , and where thieves break through and steal :
KJV	Matthew	6	20	But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt , and where thieves do not break through nor steal :
KJV	Matthew	6	21	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
KJV	Matthew	6	22	The light of the body is the eye : if therefore thine eye be single , thy whole body shall be full of light .
KJV	Matthew	6	23	But if thine eye be evil , thy whole body shall be full of darkness . If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness , how great is that darkness !
KJV	Matthew	6	24	No man can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon .
KJV	Matthew	6	25	Therefore I say unto you , Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink ; nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on . Is not the life more than meat , and the body than raiment ?
KJV	Matthew	6	26	Behold the fowls of the air : for they sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns ; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them . Are ye not much better than they ?
KJV	Matthew	6	27	Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature ?
KJV	Matthew	6	28	And why take ye thought for raiment ? Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they toil not , neither do they spin :
KJV	Matthew	6	29	And yet I say unto you , That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
KJV	Matthew	6	30	Wherefore , if God so clothe the grass of the field , which to day is , and to morrow is cast into the oven , shall he not much more clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
KJV	Matthew	6	31	Therefore take no thought , saying , What shall we eat ? or , What shall we drink ? or , Wherewithal shall we be clothed ?
KJV	Matthew	6	32	( For after all these things do the Gentiles seek : ) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things .
KJV	Matthew	6	33	But seek ye first the kingdom of God , and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
KJV	Matthew	6	34	Take therefore no thought for the morrow : for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself . Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
KJV	Matthew	7	7	Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you :
KJV	Matthew	7	2	For with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you again .
KJV	Matthew	7	3	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
KJV	Matthew	7	4	Or how wilt thou say to thy brother , Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye ; and , behold , a beam is in thine own eye ?
KJV	Matthew	7	5	Thou hypocrite , first cast out the beam out of thine own eye ; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother 's eye .
KJV	Matthew	7	6	Give not that which is holy unto the dogs , neither cast ye your pearls before swine , lest they trample them under their feet , and turn again and rend you .
KJV	Matthew	7	8	For every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
KJV	Matthew	7	9	Or what man is there of you , whom if his son ask bread , will he give him a stone ?
KJV	Matthew	7	10	Or if he ask a fish , will he give him a serpent ?
KJV	Matthew	7	11	If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?
KJV	Matthew	7	12	Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them : for this is the law and the prophets .
KJV	Matthew	7	13	Enter ye in at the strait gate : for wide is the gate , and broad is the way , that leadeth to destruction , and many there be which go in thereat :
KJV	Matthew	7	14	Because strait is the gate , and narrow is the way , which leadeth unto life , and few there be that find it .
KJV	Matthew	7	15	Beware of false prophets , which come to you in sheep 's clothing , but inwardly they are ravening wolves .
KJV	Matthew	7	16	Ye shall know them by their fruits . Do men gather grapes of thorns , or figs of thistles ?
KJV	Matthew	7	17	Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit ; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit .
KJV	Matthew	7	18	A good tree can not bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
KJV	Matthew	7	19	Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
KJV	Matthew	7	20	Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them .
KJV	Matthew	7	21	Not every one that saith unto me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven .
KJV	Matthew	7	22	Many will say to me in that day , Lord , Lord , have we not prophesied in thy name ? and in thy name have cast out devils ? and in thy name done many wonderful works ?
KJV	Matthew	7	23	And then will I profess unto them , I never knew you : depart from me , ye that work iniquity .
KJV	Matthew	7	24	Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them , I will liken him unto a wise man , which built his house upon a rock :
KJV	Matthew	7	25	And the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell not : for it was founded upon a rock .
KJV	Matthew	7	26	And every one that heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them not , shall be likened unto a foolish man , which built his house upon the sand :
KJV	Matthew	7	27	And the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell : and great was the fall of it .
KJV	Matthew	7	28	And it came to pass , when Jesus had ended these sayings , the people were astonished at his doctrine :
KJV	Matthew	7	29	For he taught them as one having authority , and not as the scribes .
KJV	Matthew	8	8	The centurion answered and said , Lord , I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof : but speak the word only , and my servant shall be healed .
KJV	Matthew	8	2	And , behold , there came a leper and worshipped him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
KJV	Matthew	8	3	And Jesus put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will ; be thou clean . And immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
KJV	Matthew	8	4	And Jesus saith unto him , See thou tell no man ; but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
KJV	Matthew	8	5	And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum , there came unto him a centurion , beseeching him ,
KJV	Matthew	8	6	And saying , Lord , my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy , grievously tormented .
KJV	Matthew	8	7	And Jesus saith unto him , I will come and heal him .
KJV	Matthew	8	9	For I am a man under authority , having soldiers under me : and I say to this man , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doeth it .
KJV	Matthew	8	10	When Jesus heard it , he marvelled , and said to them that followed , Verily I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
KJV	Matthew	8	11	And I say unto you , That many shall come from the east and west , and shall sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , in the kingdom of heaven .
KJV	Matthew	8	12	But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
KJV	Matthew	8	13	And Jesus said unto the centurion , Go thy way ; and as thou hast believed , so be it done unto thee . And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour .
KJV	Matthew	8	14	And when Jesus was come into Peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother laid , and sick of a fever .
KJV	Matthew	8	15	And he touched her hand , and the fever left her : and she arose , and ministered unto them .
KJV	Matthew	8	16	When the even was come , they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils : and he cast out the spirits with his word , and healed all that were sick :
KJV	Matthew	8	17	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet , saying , Himself took our infirmities , and bare our sicknesses .
KJV	Matthew	8	18	Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him , he gave commandment to depart unto the other side .
KJV	Matthew	8	19	And a certain scribe came , and said unto him , Master , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
KJV	Matthew	8	20	And Jesus saith unto him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
KJV	Matthew	8	21	And another of his disciples said unto him , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
KJV	Matthew	8	22	But Jesus said unto him , Follow me ; and let the dead bury their dead .
KJV	Matthew	8	23	And when he was entered into a ship , his disciples followed him .
KJV	Matthew	8	24	And , behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves : but he was asleep .
KJV	Matthew	8	25	And his disciples came to him , and awoke him , saying , Lord , save us : we perish .
KJV	Matthew	8	26	And he saith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? Then he arose , and rebuked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm .
KJV	Matthew	8	27	But the men marvelled , saying , What manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him !
KJV	Matthew	8	28	And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes , there met him two possessed with devils , coming out of the tombs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way .
KJV	Matthew	8	29	And , behold , they cried out , saying , What have we to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God ? art thou come hither to torment us before the time ?
KJV	Matthew	8	30	And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding .
KJV	Matthew	8	31	So the devils besought him , saying , If thou cast us out , suffer us to go away into the herd of swine .
KJV	Matthew	8	32	And he said unto them , Go . And when they were come out , they went into the herd of swine : and , behold , the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea , and perished in the waters .
KJV	Matthew	8	33	And they that kept them fled , and went their ways into the city , and told every thing , and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils .
KJV	Matthew	8	34	And , behold , the whole city came out to meet Jesus : and when they saw him , they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts .
KJV	Matthew	9	9	And as Jesus passed forth from thence , he saw a man , named Matthew , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he saith unto him , Follow me . And he arose , and followed him .
KJV	Matthew	9	2	And , behold , they brought to him a man sick of the palsy , lying on a bed : and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy ; Son , be of good cheer ; thy sins be forgiven thee .
KJV	Matthew	9	3	And , behold , certain of the scribes said within themselves , This man blasphemeth .
KJV	Matthew	9	4	And Jesus knowing their thoughts said , Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts ?
KJV	Matthew	9	5	For whether is easier , to say , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Arise , and walk ?
KJV	Matthew	9	6	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( then saith he to the sick of the palsy , ) Arise , take up thy bed , and go unto thine house .
KJV	Matthew	9	7	And he arose , and departed to his house .
KJV	Matthew	9	8	But when the multitudes saw it , they marvelled , and glorified God , which had given such power unto men .
KJV	Matthew	9	10	And it came to pass , as Jesus sat at meat in the house , behold , many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples .
KJV	Matthew	9	11	And when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto his disciples , Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners ?
KJV	Matthew	9	12	But when Jesus heard that , he said unto them , They that be whole need not a physician , but they that are sick .
KJV	Matthew	9	13	But go ye and learn what that meaneth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice : for I am not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
KJV	Matthew	9	14	Then came to him the disciples of John , saying , Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft , but thy disciples fast not ?
KJV	Matthew	9	15	And Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bridechamber mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken from them , and then shall they fast .
KJV	Matthew	9	16	No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment , for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment , and the rent is made worse .
KJV	Matthew	9	17	Neither do men put new wine into old bottles : else the bottles break , and the wine runneth out , and the bottles perish : but they put new wine into new bottles , and both are preserved .
KJV	Matthew	9	18	While he spake these things unto them , behold , there came a certain ruler , and worshipped him , saying , My daughter is even now dead : but come and lay thy hand upon her , and she shall live .
KJV	Matthew	9	19	And Jesus arose , and followed him , and so did his disciples .
KJV	Matthew	9	20	And , behold , a woman , which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the hem of his garment :
KJV	Matthew	9	21	For she said within herself , If I may but touch his garment , I shall be whole .
KJV	Matthew	9	22	But Jesus turned him about , and when he saw her , he said , Daughter , be of good comfort ; thy faith hath made thee whole . And the woman was made whole from that hour .
KJV	Matthew	9	23	And when Jesus came into the ruler 's house , and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise ,
KJV	Matthew	9	24	He said unto them , Give place : for the maid is not dead , but sleepeth . And they laughed him to scorn .
KJV	Matthew	9	25	But when the people were put forth , he went in , and took her by the hand , and the maid arose .
KJV	Matthew	9	26	And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land .
KJV	Matthew	9	27	And when Jesus departed thence , two blind men followed him , crying , and saying , Thou son of David , have mercy on us .
KJV	Matthew	9	28	And when he was come into the house , the blind men came to him : and Jesus saith unto them , Believe ye that I am able to do this ? They said unto him , Yea , Lord .
KJV	Matthew	9	29	Then touched he their eyes , saying , According to your faith be it unto you .
KJV	Matthew	9	30	And their eyes were opened ; and Jesus straitly charged them , saying , See that no man know it .
KJV	Matthew	9	31	But they , when they were departed , spread abroad his fame in all that country .
KJV	Matthew	9	32	As they went out , behold , they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil .
KJV	Matthew	9	33	And when the devil was cast out , the dumb spake : and the multitudes marvelled , saying , It was never so seen in Israel .
KJV	Matthew	9	34	But the Pharisees said , He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils .
KJV	Matthew	9	35	And Jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every sickness and every disease among the people .
KJV	Matthew	9	36	But when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion on them , because they fainted , and were scattered abroad , as sheep having no shepherd .
KJV	Matthew	9	37	Then saith he unto his disciples , The harvest truly is plenteous , but the labourers are few ;
KJV	Matthew	9	38	Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he will send forth labourers into his harvest .
KJV	Matthew	10	10	Nor scrip for your journey , neither two coats , neither shoes , nor yet staves : for the workman is worthy of his meat .
KJV	Matthew	10	2	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these ; The first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother ;
KJV	Matthew	10	3	Philip , and Bartholomew ; Thomas , and Matthew the publican ; James the son of Alphaeus , and Lebbaeus , whose surname was Thaddaeus ;
KJV	Matthew	10	4	Simon the Canaanite , and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him .
KJV	Matthew	10	5	These twelve Jesus sent forth , and commanded them , saying , Go not into the way of the Gentiles , and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not :
KJV	Matthew	10	6	But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
KJV	Matthew	10	7	And as ye go , preach , saying , The kingdom of heaven is at hand .
KJV	Matthew	10	8	Heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out devils : freely ye have received , freely give .
KJV	Matthew	10	9	Provide neither gold , nor silver , nor brass in your purses ,
KJV	Matthew	10	11	And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter , enquire who in it is worthy ; and there abide till ye go thence .
KJV	Matthew	10	12	And when ye come into an house , salute it .
KJV	Matthew	10	13	And if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you .
KJV	Matthew	10	14	And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , when ye depart out of that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet .
KJV	Matthew	10	15	Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
KJV	Matthew	10	16	Behold , I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves : be ye therefore wise as serpents , and harmless as doves .
KJV	Matthew	10	17	But beware of men : for they will deliver you up to the councils , and they will scourge you in their synagogues ;
KJV	Matthew	10	18	And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them and the Gentiles .
KJV	Matthew	10	19	But when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
KJV	Matthew	10	20	For it is not ye that speak , but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you .
KJV	Matthew	10	21	And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death , and the father the child : and the children shall rise up against their parents , and cause them to be put to death .
KJV	Matthew	10	22	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake : but he that endureth to the end shall be saved .
KJV	Matthew	10	23	But when they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily I say unto you , Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come .
KJV	Matthew	10	24	The disciple is not above his master , nor the servant above his lord .
KJV	Matthew	10	25	It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master , and the servant as his lord . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
KJV	Matthew	10	26	Fear them not therefore : for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known .
KJV	Matthew	10	27	What I tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear , that preach ye upon the housetops .
KJV	Matthew	10	28	And fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
KJV	Matthew	10	29	Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father .
KJV	Matthew	10	30	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
KJV	Matthew	10	31	Fear ye not therefore , ye are of more value than many sparrows .
KJV	Matthew	10	32	Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men , him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven .
KJV	Matthew	10	33	But whosoever shall deny me before men , him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven .
KJV	Matthew	10	34	Think not that I am come to send peace on earth : I came not to send peace , but a sword .
KJV	Matthew	10	35	For I am come to set a man at variance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
KJV	Matthew	10	36	And a man 's foes shall be they of his own household .
KJV	Matthew	10	37	He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me : and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
KJV	Matthew	10	38	And he that taketh not his cross , and followeth after me , is not worthy of me .
KJV	Matthew	10	39	He that findeth his life shall lose it : and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it .
KJV	Matthew	10	40	He that receiveth you receiveth me , and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
KJV	Matthew	10	41	He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet 's reward ; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man 's reward .
KJV	Matthew	10	42	And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple , verily I say unto you , he shall in no wise lose his reward .
KJV	Matthew	11	11	Verily I say unto you , Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist : notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
KJV	Matthew	11	2	Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ , he sent two of his disciples ,
KJV	Matthew	11	3	And said unto him , Art thou he that should come , or do we look for another ?
KJV	Matthew	11	4	Jesus answered and said unto them , Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see :
KJV	Matthew	11	5	The blind receive their sight , and the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have the gospel preached to them .
KJV	Matthew	11	6	And blessed is he , whosoever shall not be offended in me .
KJV	Matthew	11	7	And as they departed , Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken with the wind ?
KJV	Matthew	11	8	But what went ye out for to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they that wear soft clothing are in kings ' houses .
KJV	Matthew	11	9	But what went ye out for to see ? A prophet ? yea , I say unto you , and more than a prophet .
KJV	Matthew	11	10	For this is he , of whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
KJV	Matthew	11	12	And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence , and the violent take it by force .
KJV	Matthew	11	13	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John .
KJV	Matthew	11	14	And if ye will receive it , this is Elias , which was for to come .
KJV	Matthew	11	15	He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
KJV	Matthew	11	16	But whereunto shall I liken this generation ? It is like unto children sitting in the markets , and calling unto their fellows ,
KJV	Matthew	11	17	And saying , We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned unto you , and ye have not lamented .
KJV	Matthew	11	18	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , He hath a devil .
KJV	Matthew	11	19	The Son of man came eating and drinking , and they say , Behold a man gluttonous , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners . But wisdom is justified of her children .
KJV	Matthew	11	20	Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done , because they repented not :
KJV	Matthew	11	21	Woe unto thee , Chorazin ! woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works , which were done in you , had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
KJV	Matthew	11	22	But I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment , than for you .
KJV	Matthew	11	23	And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted unto heaven , shalt be brought down to hell : for if the mighty works , which have been done in thee , had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day .
KJV	Matthew	11	24	But I say unto you , That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment , than for thee .
KJV	Matthew	11	25	At that time Jesus answered and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes .
KJV	Matthew	11	26	Even so , Father : for so it seemed good in thy sight .
KJV	Matthew	11	27	All things are delivered unto me of my Father : and no man knoweth the Son , but the Father ; neither knoweth any man the Father , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him .
KJV	Matthew	11	28	Come unto me , all ye that labour and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest .
KJV	Matthew	11	29	Take my yoke upon you , and learn of me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
KJV	Matthew	11	30	For my yoke is easy , and my burden is light .
KJV	Matthew	12	12	How much then is a man better than a sheep ? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days .
KJV	Matthew	12	2	But when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto him , Behold , thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day .
KJV	Matthew	12	3	But he said unto them , Have ye not read what David did , when he was an hungred , and they that were with him ;
KJV	Matthew	12	4	How he entered into the house of God , and did eat the shewbread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for them which were with him , but only for the priests ?
KJV	Matthew	12	5	Or have ye not read in the law , how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are blameless ?
KJV	Matthew	12	6	But I say unto you , That in this place is one greater than the temple .
KJV	Matthew	12	7	But if ye had known what this meaneth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guiltless .
KJV	Matthew	12	8	For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day .
KJV	Matthew	12	9	And when he was departed thence , he went into their synagogue :
KJV	Matthew	12	10	And , behold , there was a man which had his hand withered . And they asked him , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days ? that they might accuse him .
KJV	Matthew	12	11	And he said unto them , What man shall there be among you , that shall have one sheep , and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day , will he not lay hold on it , and lift it out ?
KJV	Matthew	12	13	Then saith he to the man , Stretch forth thine hand . And he stretched it forth ; and it was restored whole , like as the other .
KJV	Matthew	12	14	Then the Pharisees went out , and held a council against him , how they might destroy him .
KJV	Matthew	12	15	But when Jesus knew it , he withdrew himself from thence : and great multitudes followed him , and he healed them all ;
KJV	Matthew	12	16	And charged them that they should not make him known :
KJV	Matthew	12	17	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet , saying ,
KJV	Matthew	12	18	Behold my servant , whom I have chosen ; my beloved , in whom my soul is well pleased : I will put my spirit upon him , and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles .
KJV	Matthew	12	19	He shall not strive , nor cry ; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets .
KJV	Matthew	12	20	A bruised reed shall he not break , and smoking flax shall he not quench , till he send forth judgment unto victory .
KJV	Matthew	12	21	And in his name shall the Gentiles trust .
KJV	Matthew	12	22	Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil , blind , and dumb : and he healed him , insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw .
KJV	Matthew	12	23	And all the people were amazed , and said , Is not this the son of David ?
KJV	Matthew	12	24	But when the Pharisees heard it , they said , This fellow doth not cast out devils , but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils .
KJV	Matthew	12	25	And Jesus knew their thoughts , and said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand :
KJV	Matthew	12	26	And if Satan cast out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how shall then his kingdom stand ?
KJV	Matthew	12	27	And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your children cast them out ? therefore they shall be your judges .
KJV	Matthew	12	28	But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God is come unto you .
KJV	Matthew	12	29	Or else how can one enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong man ? and then he will spoil his house .
KJV	Matthew	12	30	He that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad .
KJV	Matthew	12	31	Wherefore I say unto you , All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men : but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men .
KJV	Matthew	12	32	And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
KJV	Matthew	12	33	Either make the tree good , and his fruit good ; or else make the tree corrupt , and his fruit corrupt : for the tree is known by his fruit .
KJV	Matthew	12	34	O generation of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
KJV	Matthew	12	35	A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things : and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things .
KJV	Matthew	12	36	But I say unto you , That every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .
KJV	Matthew	12	37	For by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned .
KJV	Matthew	12	38	Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered , saying , Master , we would see a sign from thee .
KJV	Matthew	12	39	But he answered and said unto them , An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given to it , but the sign of the prophet Jonas :
KJV	Matthew	12	40	For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale 's belly ; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
KJV	Matthew	12	41	The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and , behold , a greater than Jonas is here .
KJV	Matthew	12	42	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and , behold , a greater than Solomon is here .
KJV	Matthew	12	43	When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest , and findeth none .
KJV	Matthew	12	44	Then he saith , I will return into my house from whence I came out ; and when he is come , he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished .
KJV	Matthew	12	45	Then goeth he , and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first . Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation .
KJV	Matthew	12	46	While he yet talked to the people , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , desiring to speak with him .
KJV	Matthew	12	47	Then one said unto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to speak with thee .
KJV	Matthew	12	48	But he answered and said unto him that told him , Who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ?
KJV	Matthew	12	49	And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples , and said , Behold my mother and my brethren !
KJV	Matthew	12	50	For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .
KJV	Matthew	13	13	Therefore speak I to them in parables : because they seeing see not ; and hearing they hear not , neither do they understand .
KJV	Matthew	13	2	And great multitudes were gathered together unto him , so that he went into a ship , and sat ; and the whole multitude stood on the shore .
KJV	Matthew	13	3	And he spake many things unto them in parables , saying , Behold , a sower went forth to sow ;
KJV	Matthew	13	4	And when he sowed , some seeds fell by the way side , and the fowls came and devoured them up :
KJV	Matthew	13	5	Some fell upon stony places , where they had not much earth : and forthwith they sprung up , because they had no deepness of earth :
KJV	Matthew	13	6	And when the sun was up , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away .
KJV	Matthew	13	7	And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprung up , and choked them :
KJV	Matthew	13	8	But other fell into good ground , and brought forth fruit , some an hundredfold , some sixtyfold , some thirtyfold .
KJV	Matthew	13	9	Who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
KJV	Matthew	13	10	And the disciples came , and said unto him , Why speakest thou unto them in parables ?
KJV	Matthew	13	11	He answered and said unto them , Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given .
KJV	Matthew	13	12	For whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have more abundance : but whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that he hath .
KJV	Matthew	13	14	And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias , which saith , By hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and shall not perceive :
KJV	Matthew	13	15	For this people 's heart is waxed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes they have closed ; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears , and should understand with their heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them .
KJV	Matthew	13	16	But blessed are your eyes , for they see : and your ears , for they hear .
KJV	Matthew	13	17	For verily I say unto you , That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
KJV	Matthew	13	18	Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower .
KJV	Matthew	13	19	When any one heareth the word of the kingdom , and understandeth it not , then cometh the wicked one , and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart . This is he which received seed by the way side .
KJV	Matthew	13	20	But he that received the seed into stony places , the same is he that heareth the word , and anon with joy receiveth it ;
KJV	Matthew	13	21	Yet hath he not root in himself , but dureth for a while : for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , by and by he is offended .
KJV	Matthew	13	22	He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word ; and the care of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , choke the word , and he becometh unfruitful .
KJV	Matthew	13	23	But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word , and understandeth it ; which also beareth fruit , and bringeth forth , some an hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
KJV	Matthew	13	24	Another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field :
KJV	Matthew	13	25	But while men slept , his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat , and went his way .
KJV	Matthew	13	26	But when the blade was sprung up , and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also .
KJV	Matthew	13	27	So the servants of the householder came and said unto him , Sir , didst not thou sow good seed in thy field ? from whence then hath it tares ?
KJV	Matthew	13	28	He said unto them , An enemy hath done this . The servants said unto him , Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up ?
KJV	Matthew	13	29	But he said , Nay ; lest while ye gather up the tares , ye root up also the wheat with them .
KJV	Matthew	13	30	Let both grow together until the harvest : and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers , Gather ye together first the tares , and bind them in bundles to burn them : but gather the wheat into my barn .
KJV	Matthew	13	31	Another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field :
KJV	Matthew	13	32	Which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof .
KJV	Matthew	13	33	Another parable spake he unto them ; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
KJV	Matthew	13	34	All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables ; and without a parable spake he not unto them :
KJV	Matthew	13	35	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying , I will open my mouth in parables ; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world .
KJV	Matthew	13	36	Then Jesus sent the multitude away , and went into the house : and his disciples came unto him , saying , Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field .
KJV	Matthew	13	37	He answered and said unto them , He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man ;
KJV	Matthew	13	38	The field is the world ; the good seed are the children of the kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked one ;
KJV	Matthew	13	39	The enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are the angels .
KJV	Matthew	13	40	As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire ; so shall it be in the end of this world .
KJV	Matthew	13	41	The Son of man shall send forth his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend , and them which do iniquity ;
KJV	Matthew	13	42	And shall cast them into a furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
KJV	Matthew	13	43	Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . Who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
KJV	Matthew	13	44	Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field ; the which when a man hath found , he hideth , and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath , and buyeth that field .
KJV	Matthew	13	45	Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man , seeking goodly pearls :
KJV	Matthew	13	46	Who , when he had found one pearl of great price , went and sold all that he had , and bought it .
KJV	Matthew	13	47	Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered of every kind :
KJV	Matthew	13	48	Which , when it was full , they drew to shore , and sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but cast the bad away .
KJV	Matthew	13	49	So shall it be at the end of the world : the angels shall come forth , and sever the wicked from among the just ,
KJV	Matthew	13	50	And shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
KJV	Matthew	13	51	Jesus saith unto them , Have ye understood all these things ? They say unto him , Yea , Lord .
KJV	Matthew	13	52	Then said he unto them , Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder , which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old .
KJV	Matthew	13	53	And it came to pass , that when Jesus had finished these parables , he departed thence .
KJV	Matthew	13	54	And when he was come into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , insomuch that they were astonished , and said , Whence hath this man this wisdom , and these mighty works ?
KJV	Matthew	13	55	Is not this the carpenter 's son ? is not his mother called Mary ? and his brethren , James , and Joses , and Simon , and Judas ?
KJV	Matthew	13	56	And his sisters , are they not all with us ? Whence then hath this man all these things ?
KJV	Matthew	13	57	And they were offended in him . But Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honour , save in his own country , and in his own house .
KJV	Matthew	13	58	And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief .
KJV	Matthew	14	14	And Jesus went forth , and saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion toward them , and he healed their sick .
KJV	Matthew	14	2	And said unto his servants , This is John the Baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
KJV	Matthew	14	3	For Herod had laid hold on John , and bound him , and put him in prison for Herodias ' sake , his brother Philip 's wife .
KJV	Matthew	14	4	For John said unto him , It is not lawful for thee to have her .
KJV	Matthew	14	5	And when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
KJV	Matthew	14	6	But when Herod 's birthday was kept , the daughter of Herodias danced before them , and pleased Herod .
KJV	Matthew	14	7	Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask .
KJV	Matthew	14	8	And she , being before instructed of her mother , said , Give me here John Baptist 's head in a charger .
KJV	Matthew	14	9	And the king was sorry : nevertheless for the oath 's sake , and them which sat with him at meat , he commanded it to be given her .
KJV	Matthew	14	10	And he sent , and beheaded John in the prison .
KJV	Matthew	14	11	And his head was brought in a charger , and given to the damsel : and she brought it to her mother .
KJV	Matthew	14	12	And his disciples came , and took up the body , and buried it , and went and told Jesus .
KJV	Matthew	14	13	When Jesus heard of it , he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart : and when the people had heard thereof , they followed him on foot out of the cities .
KJV	Matthew	14	15	And when it was evening , his disciples came to him , saying , This is a desert place , and the time is now past ; send the multitude away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves victuals .
KJV	Matthew	14	16	But Jesus said unto them , They need not depart ; give ye them to eat .
KJV	Matthew	14	17	And they say unto him , We have here but five loaves , and two fishes .
KJV	Matthew	14	18	He said , Bring them hither to me .
KJV	Matthew	14	19	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass , and took the five loaves , and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , and brake , and gave the loaves to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
KJV	Matthew	14	20	And they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full .
KJV	Matthew	14	21	And they that had eaten were about five thousand men , beside women and children .
KJV	Matthew	14	22	And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship , and to go before him unto the other side , while he sent the multitudes away .
KJV	Matthew	14	23	And when he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into a mountain apart to pray : and when the evening was come , he was there alone .
KJV	Matthew	14	24	But the ship was now in the midst of the sea , tossed with waves : for the wind was contrary .
KJV	Matthew	14	25	And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them , walking on the sea .
KJV	Matthew	14	26	And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , It is a spirit ; and they cried out for fear .
KJV	Matthew	14	27	But straightway Jesus spake unto them , saying , Be of good cheer ; it is I ; be not afraid .
KJV	Matthew	14	28	And Peter answered him and said , Lord , if it be thou , bid me come unto thee on the water .
KJV	Matthew	14	29	And he said , Come . And when Peter was come down out of the ship , he walked on the water , to go to Jesus .
KJV	Matthew	14	30	But when he saw the wind boisterous , he was afraid ; and beginning to sink , he cried , saying , Lord , save me .
KJV	Matthew	14	31	And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand , and caught him , and said unto him , O thou of little faith , wherefore didst thou doubt ?
KJV	Matthew	14	32	And when they were come into the ship , the wind ceased .
KJV	Matthew	14	33	Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him , saying , Of a truth thou art the Son of God .
KJV	Matthew	14	34	And when they were gone over , they came into the land of Gennesaret .
KJV	Matthew	14	35	And when the men of that place had knowledge of him , they sent out into all that country round about , and brought unto him all that were diseased ;
KJV	Matthew	14	36	And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment : and as many as touched were made perfectly whole .
KJV	Matthew	15	15	Then answered Peter and said unto him , Declare unto us this parable .
KJV	Matthew	15	2	Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread .
KJV	Matthew	15	3	But he answered and said unto them , Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition ?
KJV	Matthew	15	4	For God commanded , saying , Honour thy father and mother : and , He that curseth father or mother , let him die the death .
KJV	Matthew	15	5	But ye say , Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , It is a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me ;
KJV	Matthew	15	6	And honour not his father or his mother , he shall be free . Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition .
KJV	Matthew	15	7	Ye hypocrites , well did Esaias prophesy of you , saying ,
KJV	Matthew	15	8	This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth , and honoureth me with their lips ; but their heart is far from me .
KJV	Matthew	15	9	But in vain they do worship me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men .
KJV	Matthew	15	10	And he called the multitude , and said unto them , Hear , and understand :
KJV	Matthew	15	11	Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man ; but that which cometh out of the mouth , this defileth a man .
KJV	Matthew	15	12	Then came his disciples , and said unto him , Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended , after they heard this saying ?
KJV	Matthew	15	13	But he answered and said , Every plant , which my heavenly Father hath not planted , shall be rooted up .
KJV	Matthew	15	14	Let them alone : they be blind leaders of the blind . And if the blind lead the blind , both shall fall into the ditch .
KJV	Matthew	15	16	And Jesus said , Are ye also yet without understanding ?
KJV	Matthew	15	17	Do not ye yet understand , that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ?
KJV	Matthew	15	18	But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart ; and they defile the man .
KJV	Matthew	15	19	For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , blasphemies :
KJV	Matthew	15	20	These are the things which defile a man : but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man .
KJV	Matthew	15	21	Then Jesus went thence , and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon .
KJV	Matthew	15	22	And , behold , a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts , and cried unto him , saying , Have mercy on me , O Lord , thou son of David ; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil .
KJV	Matthew	15	23	But he answered her not a word . And his disciples came and besought him , saying , Send her away ; for she crieth after us .
KJV	Matthew	15	24	But he answered and said , I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
KJV	Matthew	15	25	Then came she and worshipped him , saying , Lord , help me .
KJV	Matthew	15	26	But he answered and said , It is not meet to take the children 's bread , and to cast it to dogs .
KJV	Matthew	15	27	And she said , Truth , Lord : yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters ' table .
KJV	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus answered and said unto her , O woman , great is thy faith : be it unto thee even as thou wilt . And her daughter was made whole from that very hour .
KJV	Matthew	15	29	And Jesus departed from thence , and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee ; and went up into a mountain , and sat down there .
KJV	Matthew	15	30	And great multitudes came unto him , having with them those that were lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and cast them down at Jesus ' feet ; and he healed them :
KJV	Matthew	15	31	Insomuch that the multitude wondered , when they saw the dumb to speak , the maimed to be whole , the lame to walk , and the blind to see : and they glorified the God of Israel .
KJV	Matthew	15	32	Then Jesus called his disciples unto him , and said , I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat : and I will not send them away fasting , lest they faint in the way .
KJV	Matthew	15	33	And his disciples say unto him , Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness , as to fill so great a multitude ?
KJV	Matthew	15	34	And Jesus saith unto them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven , and a few little fishes .
KJV	Matthew	15	35	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground .
KJV	Matthew	15	36	And he took the seven loaves and the fishes , and gave thanks , and brake them , and gave to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
KJV	Matthew	15	37	And they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full .
KJV	Matthew	15	38	And they that did eat were four thousand men , beside women and children .
KJV	Matthew	15	39	And he sent away the multitude , and took ship , and came into the coasts of Magdala .
KJV	Matthew	16	16	And Simon Peter answered and said , Thou art the Christ , the Son of the living God .
KJV	Matthew	16	2	He answered and said unto them , When it is evening , ye say , It will be fair weather : for the sky is red .
KJV	Matthew	16	3	And in the morning , It will be foul weather to day : for the sky is red and lowering . O ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky ; but can ye not discern the signs of the times ?
KJV	Matthew	16	4	A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given unto it , but the sign of the prophet Jonas . And he left them , and departed .
KJV	Matthew	16	5	And when his disciples were come to the other side , they had forgotten to take bread .
KJV	Matthew	16	6	Then Jesus said unto them , Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees .
KJV	Matthew	16	7	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have taken no bread .
KJV	Matthew	16	8	Which when Jesus perceived , he said unto them , O ye of little faith , why reason ye among yourselves , because ye have brought no bread ?
KJV	Matthew	16	9	Do ye not yet understand , neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
KJV	Matthew	16	10	Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
KJV	Matthew	16	11	How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread , that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees ?
KJV	Matthew	16	12	Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread , but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees .
KJV	Matthew	16	13	When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , Whom do men say that I the Son of man am ?
KJV	Matthew	16	14	And they said , Some say that thou art John the Baptist : some , Elias ; and others , Jeremias , or one of the prophets .
KJV	Matthew	16	15	He saith unto them , But whom say ye that I am ?
KJV	Matthew	16	17	And Jesus answered and said unto him , Blessed art thou , Simon Barjona : for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee , but my Father which is in heaven .
KJV	Matthew	16	18	And I say also unto thee , That thou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it .
KJV	Matthew	16	19	And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
KJV	Matthew	16	20	Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ .
KJV	Matthew	16	21	From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples , how that he must go unto Jerusalem , and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and be raised again the third day .
KJV	Matthew	16	22	Then Peter took him , and began to rebuke him , saying , Be it far from thee , Lord : this shall not be unto thee .
KJV	Matthew	16	23	But he turned , and said unto Peter , Get thee behind me , Satan : thou art an offence unto me : for thou savourest not the things that be of God , but those that be of men .
KJV	Matthew	16	24	Then said Jesus unto his disciples , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
KJV	Matthew	16	25	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it : and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it .
KJV	Matthew	16	26	For what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
KJV	Matthew	16	27	For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels ; and then he shall reward every man according to his works .
KJV	Matthew	16	28	Verily I say unto you , There be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom .
KJV	Matthew	17	17	Then Jesus answered and said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I suffer you ? bring him hither to me .
KJV	Matthew	17	2	And was transfigured before them : and his face did shine as the sun , and his raiment was white as the light .
KJV	Matthew	17	3	And , behold , there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him .
KJV	Matthew	17	4	Then answered Peter , and said unto Jesus , Lord , it is good for us to be here : if thou wilt , let us make here three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias .
KJV	Matthew	17	5	While he yet spake , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them : and behold a voice out of the cloud , which said , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased ; hear ye him .
KJV	Matthew	17	6	And when the disciples heard it , they fell on their face , and were sore afraid .
KJV	Matthew	17	7	And Jesus came and touched them , and said , Arise , and be not afraid .
KJV	Matthew	17	8	And when they had lifted up their eyes , they saw no man , save Jesus only .
KJV	Matthew	17	9	And as they came down from the mountain , Jesus charged them , saying , Tell the vision to no man , until the Son of man be risen again from the dead .
KJV	Matthew	17	10	And his disciples asked him , saying , Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come ?
KJV	Matthew	17	11	And Jesus answered and said unto them , Elias truly shall first come , and restore all things .
KJV	Matthew	17	12	But I say unto you , That Elias is come already , and they knew him not , but have done unto him whatsoever they listed . Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them .
KJV	Matthew	17	13	Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist .
KJV	Matthew	17	14	And when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a certain man , kneeling down to him , and saying ,
KJV	Matthew	17	15	Lord , have mercy on my son : for he is lunatick , and sore vexed : for ofttimes he falleth into the fire , and oft into the water .
KJV	Matthew	17	16	And I brought him to thy disciples , and they could not cure him .
KJV	Matthew	17	18	And Jesus rebuked the devil ; and he departed out of him : and the child was cured from that very hour .
KJV	Matthew	17	19	Then came the disciples to Jesus apart , and said , Why could not we cast him out ?
KJV	Matthew	17	20	And Jesus said unto them , Because of your unbelief : for verily I say unto you , If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye shall say unto this mountain , Remove hence to yonder place ; and it shall remove ; and nothing shall be impossible unto you .
KJV	Matthew	17	21	Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting .
KJV	Matthew	17	22	And while they abode in Galilee , Jesus said unto them , The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men :
KJV	Matthew	17	23	And they shall kill him , and the third day he shall be raised again . And they were exceeding sorry .
KJV	Matthew	17	24	And when they were come to Capernaum , they that received tribute money came to Peter , and said , Doth not your master pay tribute ?
KJV	Matthew	17	25	He saith , Yes . And when he was come into the house , Jesus prevented him , saying , What thinkest thou , Simon ? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute ? of their own children , or of strangers ?
KJV	Matthew	17	26	Peter saith unto him , Of strangers . Jesus saith unto him , Then are the children free .
KJV	Matthew	17	27	Notwithstanding , lest we should offend them , go thou to the sea , and cast an hook , and take up the fish that first cometh up ; and when thou hast opened his mouth , thou shalt find a piece of money : that take , and give unto them for me and thee .
KJV	Matthew	18	18	Verily I say unto you , Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
KJV	Matthew	18	2	And Jesus called a little child unto him , and set him in the midst of them ,
KJV	Matthew	18	3	And said , Verily I say unto you , Except ye be converted , and become as little children , ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven .
KJV	Matthew	18	4	Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
KJV	Matthew	18	5	And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me .
KJV	Matthew	18	6	But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me , it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea .
KJV	Matthew	18	7	Woe unto the world because of offences ! for it must needs be that offences come ; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh !
KJV	Matthew	18	8	Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee , cut them off , and cast them from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed , rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire .
KJV	Matthew	18	9	And if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
KJV	Matthew	18	10	Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones ; for I say unto you , That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven .
KJV	Matthew	18	11	For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost .
KJV	Matthew	18	12	How think ye ? if a man have an hundred sheep , and one of them be gone astray , doth he not leave the ninety and nine , and goeth into the mountains , and seeketh that which is gone astray ?
KJV	Matthew	18	13	And if so be that he find it , verily I say unto you , he rejoiceth more of that sheep , than of the ninety and nine which went not astray .
KJV	Matthew	18	14	Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven , that one of these little ones should perish .
KJV	Matthew	18	15	Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee , go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone : if he shall hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother .
KJV	Matthew	18	16	But if he will not hear thee , then take with thee one or two more , that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
KJV	Matthew	18	17	And if he shall neglect to hear them , tell it unto the church : but if he neglect to hear the church , let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican .
KJV	Matthew	18	19	Again I say unto you , That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven .
KJV	Matthew	18	20	For where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am I in the midst of them .
KJV	Matthew	18	21	Then came Peter to him , and said , Lord , how oft shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? till seven times ?
KJV	Matthew	18	22	Jesus saith unto him , I say not unto thee , Until seven times : but , Until seventy times seven .
KJV	Matthew	18	23	Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king , which would take account of his servants .
KJV	Matthew	18	24	And when he had begun to reckon , one was brought unto him , which owed him ten thousand talents .
KJV	Matthew	18	25	But forasmuch as he had not to pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , and his wife , and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
KJV	Matthew	18	26	The servant therefore fell down , and worshipped him , saying , Lord , have patience with me , and I will pay thee all .
KJV	Matthew	18	27	Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion , and loosed him , and forgave him the debt .
KJV	Matthew	18	28	But the same servant went out , and found one of his fellowservants , which owed him an hundred pence : and he laid hands on him , and took him by the throat , saying , Pay me that thou owest .
KJV	Matthew	18	29	And his fellowservant fell down at his feet , and besought him , saying , Have patience with me , and I will pay thee all .
KJV	Matthew	18	30	And he would not : but went and cast him into prison , till he should pay the debt .
KJV	Matthew	18	31	So when his fellowservants saw what was done , they were very sorry , and came and told unto their lord all that was done .
KJV	Matthew	18	32	Then his lord , after that he had called him , said unto him , O thou wicked servant , I forgave thee all that debt , because thou desiredst me :
KJV	Matthew	18	33	Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant , even as I had pity on thee ?
KJV	Matthew	18	34	And his lord was wroth , and delivered him to the tormentors , till he should pay all that was due unto him .
KJV	Matthew	18	35	So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you , if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses .
KJV	Matthew	19	19	Honour thy father and thy mother : and , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
KJV	Matthew	19	2	And great multitudes followed him ; and he healed them there .
KJV	Matthew	19	3	The Pharisees also came unto him , tempting him , and saying unto him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ?
KJV	Matthew	19	4	And he answered and said unto them , Have ye not read , that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female ,
KJV	Matthew	19	5	And said , For this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife : and they twain shall be one flesh ?
KJV	Matthew	19	6	Wherefore they are no more twain , but one flesh . What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
KJV	Matthew	19	7	They say unto him , Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement , and to put her away ?
KJV	Matthew	19	8	He saith unto them , Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so .
KJV	Matthew	19	9	And I say unto you , Whosoever shall put away his wife , except it be for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery .
KJV	Matthew	19	10	His disciples say unto him , If the case of the man be so with his wife , it is not good to marry .
KJV	Matthew	19	11	But he said unto them , All men can not receive this saying , save they to whom it is given .
KJV	Matthew	19	12	For there are some eunuchs , which were so born from their mother 's womb : and there are some eunuchs , which were made eunuchs of men : and there be eunuchs , which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven 's sake . He that is able to receive it , let him receive it .
KJV	Matthew	19	13	Then were there brought unto him little children , that he should put his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebuked them .
KJV	Matthew	19	14	But Jesus said , Suffer little children , and forbid them not , to come unto me : for of such is the kingdom of heaven .
KJV	Matthew	19	15	And he laid his hands on them , and departed thence .
KJV	Matthew	19	16	And , behold , one came and said unto him , Good Master , what good thing shall I do , that I may have eternal life ?
KJV	Matthew	19	17	And he said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , that is , God : but if thou wilt enter into life , keep the commandments .
KJV	Matthew	19	18	He saith unto him , Which ? Jesus said , Thou shalt do no murder , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false witness ,
KJV	Matthew	19	20	The young man saith unto him , All these things have I kept from my youth up : what lack I yet ?
KJV	Matthew	19	21	Jesus said unto him , If thou wilt be perfect , go and sell that thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come and follow me .
KJV	Matthew	19	22	But when the young man heard that saying , he went away sorrowful : for he had great possessions .
KJV	Matthew	19	23	Then said Jesus unto his disciples , Verily I say unto you , That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven .
KJV	Matthew	19	24	And again I say unto you , It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
KJV	Matthew	19	25	When his disciples heard it , they were exceedingly amazed , saying , Who then can be saved ?
KJV	Matthew	19	26	But Jesus beheld them , and said unto them , With men this is impossible ; but with God all things are possible .
KJV	Matthew	19	27	Then answered Peter and said unto him , Behold , we have forsaken all , and followed thee ; what shall we have therefore ?
KJV	Matthew	19	28	And Jesus said unto them , Verily I say unto you , That ye which have followed me , in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory , ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
KJV	Matthew	19	29	And every one that hath forsaken houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name 's sake , shall receive an hundredfold , and shall inherit everlasting life .
KJV	Matthew	19	30	But many that are first shall be last ; and the last shall be first .
KJV	Matthew	20	20	Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons , worshipping him , and desiring a certain thing of him .
KJV	Matthew	20	2	And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
KJV	Matthew	20	3	And he went out about the third hour , and saw others standing idle in the marketplace ,
KJV	Matthew	20	4	And said unto them ; Go ye also into the vineyard , and whatsoever is right I will give you . And they went their way .
KJV	Matthew	20	5	Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour , and did likewise .
KJV	Matthew	20	6	And about the eleventh hour he went out , and found others standing idle , and saith unto them , Why stand ye here all the day idle ?
KJV	Matthew	20	7	They say unto him , Because no man hath hired us . He saith unto them , Go ye also into the vineyard ; and whatsoever is right , that shall ye receive .
KJV	Matthew	20	8	So when even was come , the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward , Call the labourers , and give them their hire , beginning from the last unto the first .
KJV	Matthew	20	9	And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour , they received every man a penny .
KJV	Matthew	20	10	But when the first came , they supposed that they should have received more ; and they likewise received every man a penny .
KJV	Matthew	20	11	And when they had received it , they murmured against the goodman of the house ,
KJV	Matthew	20	12	Saying , These last have wrought but one hour , and thou hast made them equal unto us , which have borne the burden and heat of the day .
KJV	Matthew	20	13	But he answered one of them , and said , Friend , I do thee no wrong : didst not thou agree with me for a penny ?
KJV	Matthew	20	14	Take that thine is , and go thy way : I will give unto this last , even as unto thee .
KJV	Matthew	20	15	Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own ? Is thine eye evil , because I am good ?
KJV	Matthew	20	16	So the last shall be first , and the first last : for many be called , but few chosen .
KJV	Matthew	20	17	And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way , and said unto them ,
KJV	Matthew	20	18	Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes , and they shall condemn him to death ,
KJV	Matthew	20	19	And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify him : and the third day he shall rise again .
KJV	Matthew	20	21	And he said unto her , What wilt thou ? She saith unto him , Grant that these my two sons may sit , the one on thy right hand , and the other on the left , in thy kingdom .
KJV	Matthew	20	22	But Jesus answered and said , Ye know not what ye ask . Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of , and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? They say unto him , We are able .
KJV	Matthew	20	23	And he saith unto them , Ye shall drink indeed of my cup , and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with : but to sit on my right hand , and on my left , is not mine to give , but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father .
KJV	Matthew	20	24	And when the ten heard it , they were moved with indignation against the two brethren .
KJV	Matthew	20	25	But Jesus called them unto him , and said , Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them , and they that are great exercise authority upon them .
KJV	Matthew	20	26	But it shall not be so among you : but whosoever will be great among you , let him be your minister ;
KJV	Matthew	20	27	And whosoever will be chief among you , let him be your servant :
KJV	Matthew	20	28	Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
KJV	Matthew	20	29	And as they departed from Jericho , a great multitude followed him .
KJV	Matthew	20	30	And , behold , two blind men sitting by the way side , when they heard that Jesus passed by , cried out , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou son of David .
KJV	Matthew	20	31	And the multitude rebuked them , because they should hold their peace : but they cried the more , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou son of David .
KJV	Matthew	20	32	And Jesus stood still , and called them , and said , What will ye that I shall do unto you ?
KJV	Matthew	20	33	They say unto him , Lord , that our eyes may be opened .
KJV	Matthew	20	34	So Jesus had compassion on them , and touched their eyes : and immediately their eyes received sight , and they followed him .
KJV	Matthew	21	21	Jesus answered and said unto them , Verily I say unto you , If ye have faith , and doubt not , ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree , but also if ye shall say unto this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; it shall be done .
KJV	Matthew	21	2	Saying unto them , Go into the village over against you , and straightway ye shall find an ass tied , and a colt with her : loose them , and bring them unto me .
KJV	Matthew	21	3	And if any man say ought unto you , ye shall say , The Lord hath need of them ; and straightway he will send them .
KJV	Matthew	21	4	All this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying ,
KJV	Matthew	21	5	Tell ye the daughter of Sion , Behold , thy King cometh unto thee , meek , and sitting upon an ass , and a colt the foal of an ass .
KJV	Matthew	21	6	And the disciples went , and did as Jesus commanded them ,
KJV	Matthew	21	7	And brought the ass , and the colt , and put on them their clothes , and they set him thereon .
KJV	Matthew	21	8	And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way ; others cut down branches from the trees , and strawed them in the way .
KJV	Matthew	21	9	And the multitudes that went before , and that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna to the son of David : Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord ; Hosanna in the highest .
KJV	Matthew	21	10	And when he was come into Jerusalem , all the city was moved , saying , Who is this ?
KJV	Matthew	21	11	And the multitude said , This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee .
KJV	Matthew	21	12	And Jesus went into the temple of God , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ,
KJV	Matthew	21	13	And said unto them , It is written , My house shall be called the house of prayer ; but ye have made it a den of thieves .
KJV	Matthew	21	14	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple ; and he healed them .
KJV	Matthew	21	15	And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children crying in the temple , and saying , Hosanna to the son of David ; they were sore displeased ,
KJV	Matthew	21	16	And said unto him , Hearest thou what these say ? And Jesus saith unto them , Yea ; have ye never read , Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ?
KJV	Matthew	21	17	And he left them , and went out of the city into Bethany ; and he lodged there .
KJV	Matthew	21	18	Now in the morning as he returned into the city , he hungered .
KJV	Matthew	21	19	And when he saw a fig tree in the way , he came to it , and found nothing thereon , but leaves only , and said unto it , Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever . And presently the fig tree withered away .
KJV	Matthew	21	20	And when the disciples saw it , they marvelled , saying , How soon is the fig tree withered away !
KJV	Matthew	21	22	And all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive .
KJV	Matthew	21	23	And when he was come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ?
KJV	Matthew	21	24	And Jesus answered and said unto them , I also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
KJV	Matthew	21	25	The baptism of John , whence was it ? from heaven , or of men ? And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say unto us , Why did ye not then believe him ?
KJV	Matthew	21	26	But if we shall say , Of men ; we fear the people ; for all hold John as a prophet .
KJV	Matthew	21	27	And they answered Jesus , and said , We can not tell . And he said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things .
KJV	Matthew	21	28	But what think ye ? A certain man had two sons ; and he came to the first , and said , Son , go work to day in my vineyard .
KJV	Matthew	21	29	He answered and said , I will not : but afterward he repented , and went .
KJV	Matthew	21	30	And he came to the second , and said likewise . And he answered and said , I go , sir : and went not .
KJV	Matthew	21	31	Whether of them twain did the will of his father ? They say unto him , The first . Jesus saith unto them , Verily I say unto you , That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you .
KJV	Matthew	21	32	For John came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not : but the publicans and the harlots believed him : and ye , when ye had seen it , repented not afterward , that ye might believe him .
KJV	Matthew	21	33	Hear another parable : There was a certain householder , which planted a vineyard , and hedged it round about , and digged a winepress in it , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a far country :
KJV	Matthew	21	34	And when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen , that they might receive the fruits of it .
KJV	Matthew	21	35	And the husbandmen took his servants , and beat one , and killed another , and stoned another .
KJV	Matthew	21	36	Again , he sent other servants more than the first : and they did unto them likewise .
KJV	Matthew	21	37	But last of all he sent unto them his son , saying , They will reverence my son .
KJV	Matthew	21	38	But when the husbandmen saw the son , they said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance .
KJV	Matthew	21	39	And they caught him , and cast him out of the vineyard , and slew him .
KJV	Matthew	21	40	When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh , what will he do unto those husbandmen ?
KJV	Matthew	21	41	They say unto him , He will miserably destroy those wicked men , and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen , which shall render him the fruits in their seasons .
KJV	Matthew	21	42	Jesus saith unto them , Did ye never read in the scriptures , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner : this is the Lord 's doing , and it is marvellous in our eyes ?
KJV	Matthew	21	43	Therefore say I unto you , The kingdom of God shall be taken from you , and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof .
KJV	Matthew	21	44	And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken : but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder .
KJV	Matthew	21	45	And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables , they perceived that he spake of them .
KJV	Matthew	21	46	But when they sought to lay hands on him , they feared the multitude , because they took him for a prophet .
KJV	Matthew	22	22	When they had heard these words , they marvelled , and left him , and went their way .
KJV	Matthew	22	2	The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king , which made a marriage for his son ,
KJV	Matthew	22	3	And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding : and they would not come .
KJV	Matthew	22	4	Again , he sent forth other servants , saying , Tell them which are bidden , Behold , I have prepared my dinner : my oxen and my fatlings are killed , and all things are ready : come unto the marriage .
KJV	Matthew	22	5	But they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his farm , another to his merchandise :
KJV	Matthew	22	6	And the remnant took his servants , and entreated them spitefully , and slew them .
KJV	Matthew	22	7	But when the king heard thereof , he was wroth : and he sent forth his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned up their city .
KJV	Matthew	22	8	Then saith he to his servants , The wedding is ready , but they which were bidden were not worthy .
KJV	Matthew	22	9	Go ye therefore into the highways , and as many as ye shall find , bid to the marriage .
KJV	Matthew	22	10	So those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all as many as they found , both bad and good : and the wedding was furnished with guests .
KJV	Matthew	22	11	And when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment :
KJV	Matthew	22	12	And he saith unto him , Friend , how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment ? And he was speechless .
KJV	Matthew	22	13	Then said the king to the servants , Bind him hand and foot , and take him away , and cast him into outer darkness , there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
KJV	Matthew	22	14	For many are called , but few are chosen .
KJV	Matthew	22	15	Then went the Pharisees , and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk .
KJV	Matthew	22	16	And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians , saying , Master , we know that thou art true , and teachest the way of God in truth , neither carest thou for any man : for thou regardest not the person of men .
KJV	Matthew	22	17	Tell us therefore , What thinkest thou ? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar , or not ?
KJV	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus perceived their wickedness , and said , Why tempt ye me , ye hypocrites ?
KJV	Matthew	22	19	Shew me the tribute money . And they brought unto him a penny .
KJV	Matthew	22	20	And he saith unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ?
KJV	Matthew	22	21	They say unto him , Caesar 's . Then saith he unto them , Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar 's ; and unto God the things that are God 's .
KJV	Matthew	22	23	The same day came to him the Sadducees , which say that there is no resurrection , and asked him ,
KJV	Matthew	22	24	Saying , Master , Moses said , If a man die , having no children , his brother shall marry his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
KJV	Matthew	22	25	Now there were with us seven brethren : and the first , when he had married a wife , deceased , and , having no issue , left his wife unto his brother :
KJV	Matthew	22	26	Likewise the second also , and the third , unto the seventh .
KJV	Matthew	22	27	And last of all the woman died also .
KJV	Matthew	22	28	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven ? for they all had her .
KJV	Matthew	22	29	Jesus answered and said unto them , Ye do err , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God .
KJV	Matthew	22	30	For in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as the angels of God in heaven .
KJV	Matthew	22	31	But as touching the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God , saying ,
KJV	Matthew	22	32	I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not the God of the dead , but of the living .
KJV	Matthew	22	33	And when the multitude heard this , they were astonished at his doctrine .
KJV	Matthew	22	34	But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence , they were gathered together .
KJV	Matthew	22	35	Then one of them , which was a lawyer , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying ,
KJV	Matthew	22	36	Master , which is the great commandment in the law ?
KJV	Matthew	22	37	Jesus said unto him , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind .
KJV	Matthew	22	38	This is the first and great commandment .
KJV	Matthew	22	39	And the second is like unto it , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
KJV	Matthew	22	40	On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets .
KJV	Matthew	22	41	While the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them ,
KJV	Matthew	22	42	Saying , What think ye of Christ ? whose son is he ? They say unto him , The son of David .
KJV	Matthew	22	43	He saith unto them , How then doth David in spirit call him Lord , saying ,
KJV	Matthew	22	44	The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool ?
KJV	Matthew	22	45	If David then call him Lord , how is he his son ?
KJV	Matthew	22	46	And no man was able to answer him a word , neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions .
KJV	Matthew	23	23	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin , and have omitted the weightier matters of the law , judgment , mercy , and faith : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
KJV	Matthew	23	2	Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses ' seat :
KJV	Matthew	23	3	All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe , that observe and do ; but do not ye after their works : for they say , and do not .
KJV	Matthew	23	4	For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne , and lay them on men 's shoulders ; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers .
KJV	Matthew	23	5	But all their works they do for to be seen of men : they make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge the borders of their garments ,
KJV	Matthew	23	6	And love the uppermost rooms at feasts , and the chief seats in the synagogues ,
KJV	Matthew	23	7	And greetings in the markets , and to be called of men , Rabbi , Rabbi .
KJV	Matthew	23	8	But be not ye called Rabbi : for one is your Master , even Christ ; and all ye are brethren .
KJV	Matthew	23	9	And call no man your father upon the earth : for one is your Father , which is in heaven .
KJV	Matthew	23	10	Neither be ye called masters : for one is your Master , even Christ .
KJV	Matthew	23	11	But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant .
KJV	Matthew	23	12	And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased ; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted .
KJV	Matthew	23	13	But woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men : for ye neither go in yourselves , neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in .
KJV	Matthew	23	14	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayer : therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation .
KJV	Matthew	23	15	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte , and when he is made , ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves .
KJV	Matthew	23	16	Woe unto you , ye blind guides , which say , Whosoever shall swear by the temple , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple , he is a debtor !
KJV	Matthew	23	17	Ye fools and blind : for whether is greater , the gold , or the temple that sanctifieth the gold ?
KJV	Matthew	23	18	And , Whosoever shall swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it , he is guilty .
KJV	Matthew	23	19	Ye fools and blind : for whether is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifieth the gift ?
KJV	Matthew	23	20	Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar , sweareth by it , and by all things thereon .
KJV	Matthew	23	21	And whoso shall swear by the temple , sweareth by it , and by him that dwelleth therein .
KJV	Matthew	23	22	And he that shall swear by heaven , sweareth by the throne of God , and by him that sitteth thereon .
KJV	Matthew	23	24	Ye blind guides , which strain at a gnat , and swallow a camel .
KJV	Matthew	23	25	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and excess .
KJV	Matthew	23	26	Thou blind Pharisee , cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter , that the outside of them may be clean also .
KJV	Matthew	23	27	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres , which indeed appear beautiful outward , but are within full of dead men 's bones , and of all uncleanness .
KJV	Matthew	23	28	Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men , but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
KJV	Matthew	23	29	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye build the tombs of the prophets , and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous ,
KJV	Matthew	23	30	And say , If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
KJV	Matthew	23	31	Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves , that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets .
KJV	Matthew	23	32	Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers .
KJV	Matthew	23	33	Ye serpents , ye generation of vipers , how can ye escape the damnation of hell ?
KJV	Matthew	23	34	Wherefore , behold , I send unto you prophets , and wise men , and scribes : and some of them ye shall kill and crucify ; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues , and persecute them from city to city :
KJV	Matthew	23	35	That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth , from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias , whom ye slew between the temple and the altar .
KJV	Matthew	23	36	Verily I say unto you , All these things shall come upon this generation .
KJV	Matthew	23	37	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , thou that killest the prophets , and stonest them which are sent unto thee , how often would I have gathered thy children together , even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not !
KJV	Matthew	23	38	Behold , your house is left unto you desolate .
KJV	Matthew	23	39	For I say unto you , Ye shall not see me henceforth , till ye shall say , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord .
KJV	Matthew	24	24	For there shall arise false Christs , and false prophets , and shall shew great signs and wonders ; insomuch that , if it were possible , they shall deceive the very elect .
KJV	Matthew	24	2	And Jesus said unto them , See ye not all these things ? verily I say unto you , There shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
KJV	Matthew	24	3	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives , the disciples came unto him privately , saying , Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign of thy coming , and of the end of the world ?
KJV	Matthew	24	4	And Jesus answered and said unto them , Take heed that no man deceive you .
KJV	Matthew	24	5	For many shall come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and shall deceive many .
KJV	Matthew	24	6	And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars : see that ye be not troubled : for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
KJV	Matthew	24	7	For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be famines , and pestilences , and earthquakes , in divers places .
KJV	Matthew	24	8	All these are the beginning of sorrows .
KJV	Matthew	24	9	Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted , and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name 's sake .
KJV	Matthew	24	10	And then shall many be offended , and shall betray one another , and shall hate one another .
KJV	Matthew	24	11	And many false prophets shall rise , and shall deceive many .
KJV	Matthew	24	12	And because iniquity shall abound , the love of many shall wax cold .
KJV	Matthew	24	13	But he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
KJV	Matthew	24	14	And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come .
KJV	Matthew	24	15	When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , stand in the holy place , ( whoso readeth , let him understand : )
KJV	Matthew	24	16	Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains :
KJV	Matthew	24	17	Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house :
KJV	Matthew	24	18	Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes .
KJV	Matthew	24	19	And woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
KJV	Matthew	24	20	But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter , neither on the sabbath day :
KJV	Matthew	24	21	For then shall be great tribulation , such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time , no , nor ever shall be .
KJV	Matthew	24	22	And except those days should be shortened , there should no flesh be saved : but for the elect 's sake those days shall be shortened .
KJV	Matthew	24	23	Then if any man shall say unto you , Lo , here is Christ , or there ; believe it not .
KJV	Matthew	24	25	Behold , I have told you before .
KJV	Matthew	24	26	Wherefore if they shall say unto you , Behold , he is in the desert ; go not forth : behold , he is in the secret chambers ; believe it not .
KJV	Matthew	24	27	For as the lightning cometh out of the east , and shineth even unto the west ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
KJV	Matthew	24	28	For wheresoever the carcase is , there will the eagles be gathered together .
KJV	Matthew	24	29	Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken :
KJV	Matthew	24	30	And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven : and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn , and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
KJV	Matthew	24	31	And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
KJV	Matthew	24	32	Now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When his branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is nigh :
KJV	Matthew	24	33	So likewise ye , when ye shall see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors .
KJV	Matthew	24	34	Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled .
KJV	Matthew	24	35	Heaven and earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away .
KJV	Matthew	24	36	But of that day and hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels of heaven , but my Father only .
KJV	Matthew	24	37	But as the days of Noah were , so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
KJV	Matthew	24	38	For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark ,
KJV	Matthew	24	39	And knew not until the flood came , and took them all away ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
KJV	Matthew	24	40	Then shall two be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
KJV	Matthew	24	41	Two women shall be grinding at the mill ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
KJV	Matthew	24	42	Watch therefore : for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come .
KJV	Matthew	24	43	But know this , that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
KJV	Matthew	24	44	Therefore be ye also ready : for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh .
KJV	Matthew	24	45	Who then is a faithful and wise servant , whom his lord hath made ruler over his household , to give them meat in due season ?
KJV	Matthew	24	46	Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
KJV	Matthew	24	47	Verily I say unto you , That he shall make him ruler over all his goods .
KJV	Matthew	24	48	But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ;
KJV	Matthew	24	49	And shall begin to smite his fellowservants , and to eat and drink with the drunken ;
KJV	Matthew	24	50	The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him , and in an hour that he is not aware of ,
KJV	Matthew	24	51	And shall cut him asunder , and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
KJV	Matthew	25	25	And I was afraid , and went and hid thy talent in the earth : lo , there thou hast that is thine .
KJV	Matthew	25	2	And five of them were wise , and five were foolish .
KJV	Matthew	25	3	They that were foolish took their lamps , and took no oil with them :
KJV	Matthew	25	4	But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps .
KJV	Matthew	25	5	While the bridegroom tarried , they all slumbered and slept .
KJV	Matthew	25	6	And at midnight there was a cry made , Behold , the bridegroom cometh ; go ye out to meet him .
KJV	Matthew	25	7	Then all those virgins arose , and trimmed their lamps .
KJV	Matthew	25	8	And the foolish said unto the wise , Give us of your oil ; for our lamps are gone out .
KJV	Matthew	25	9	But the wise answered , saying , Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .
KJV	Matthew	25	10	And while they went to buy , the bridegroom came ; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage : and the door was shut .
KJV	Matthew	25	11	Afterward came also the other virgins , saying , Lord , Lord , open to us .
KJV	Matthew	25	12	But he answered and said , Verily I say unto you , I know you not .
KJV	Matthew	25	13	Watch therefore , for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh .
KJV	Matthew	25	14	For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country , who called his own servants , and delivered unto them his goods .
KJV	Matthew	25	15	And unto one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another one ; to every man according to his several ability ; and straightway took his journey .
KJV	Matthew	25	16	Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same , and made them other five talents .
KJV	Matthew	25	17	And likewise he that had received two , he also gained other two .
KJV	Matthew	25	18	But he that had received one went and digged in the earth , and hid his lord 's money .
KJV	Matthew	25	19	After a long time the lord of those servants cometh , and reckoneth with them .
KJV	Matthew	25	20	And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents , saying , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me five talents : behold , I have gained beside them five talents more .
KJV	Matthew	25	21	His lord said unto him , Well done , thou good and faithful servant : thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
KJV	Matthew	25	22	He also that had received two talents came and said , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me two talents : behold , I have gained two other talents beside them .
KJV	Matthew	25	23	His lord said unto him , Well done , good and faithful servant ; thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
KJV	Matthew	25	24	Then he which had received the one talent came and said , Lord , I knew thee that thou art an hard man , reaping where thou hast not sown , and gathering where thou hast not strawed :
KJV	Matthew	25	26	His lord answered and said unto him , Thou wicked and slothful servant , thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not , and gather where I have not strawed :
KJV	Matthew	25	27	Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers , and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury .
KJV	Matthew	25	28	Take therefore the talent from him , and give it unto him which hath ten talents .
KJV	Matthew	25	29	For unto every one that hath shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath .
KJV	Matthew	25	30	And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
KJV	Matthew	25	31	When the Son of man shall come in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory :
KJV	Matthew	25	32	And before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats :
KJV	Matthew	25	33	And he shall set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
KJV	Matthew	25	34	Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand , Come , ye blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world :
KJV	Matthew	25	35	For I was an hungred , and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : I was a stranger , and ye took me in :
KJV	Matthew	25	36	Naked , and ye clothed me : I was sick , and ye visited me : I was in prison , and ye came unto me .
KJV	Matthew	25	37	Then shall the righteous answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee an hungred , and fed thee ? or thirsty , and gave thee drink ?
KJV	Matthew	25	38	When saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ? or naked , and clothed thee ?
KJV	Matthew	25	39	Or when saw we thee sick , or in prison , and came unto thee ?
KJV	Matthew	25	40	And the King shall answer and say unto them , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it unto me .
KJV	Matthew	25	41	Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand , Depart from me , ye cursed , into everlasting fire , prepared for the devil and his angels :
KJV	Matthew	25	42	For I was an hungred , and ye gave me no meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me no drink :
KJV	Matthew	25	43	I was a stranger , and ye took me not in : naked , and ye clothed me not : sick , and in prison , and ye visited me not .
KJV	Matthew	25	44	Then shall they also answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee an hungred , or athirst , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and did not minister unto thee ?
KJV	Matthew	25	45	Then shall he answer them , saying , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these , ye did it not to me .
KJV	Matthew	25	46	And these shall go away into everlasting punishment : but the righteous into life eternal .
KJV	Matthew	26	26	And as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and blessed it , and brake it , and gave it to the disciples , and said , Take , eat ; this is my body .
KJV	Matthew	26	2	Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover , and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified .
KJV	Matthew	26	3	Then assembled together the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders of the people , unto the palace of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas ,
KJV	Matthew	26	4	And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty , and kill him .
KJV	Matthew	26	5	But they said , Not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar among the people .
KJV	Matthew	26	6	Now when Jesus was in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper ,
KJV	Matthew	26	7	There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment , and poured it on his head , as he sat at meat .
KJV	Matthew	26	8	But when his disciples saw it , they had indignation , saying , To what purpose is this waste ?
KJV	Matthew	26	9	For this ointment might have been sold for much , and given to the poor .
KJV	Matthew	26	10	When Jesus understood it , he said unto them , Why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me .
KJV	Matthew	26	11	For ye have the poor always with you ; but me ye have not always .
KJV	Matthew	26	12	For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body , she did it for my burial .
KJV	Matthew	26	13	Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , there shall also this , that this woman hath done , be told for a memorial of her .
KJV	Matthew	26	14	Then one of the twelve , called Judas Iscariot , went unto the chief priests ,
KJV	Matthew	26	15	And said unto them , What will ye give me , and I will deliver him unto you ? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver .
KJV	Matthew	26	16	And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him .
KJV	Matthew	26	17	Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus , saying unto him , Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover ?
KJV	Matthew	26	18	And he said , Go into the city to such a man , and say unto him , The Master saith , My time is at hand ; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples .
KJV	Matthew	26	19	And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them ; and they made ready the passover .
KJV	Matthew	26	20	Now when the even was come , he sat down with the twelve .
KJV	Matthew	26	21	And as they did eat , he said , Verily I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
KJV	Matthew	26	22	And they were exceeding sorrowful , and began every one of them to say unto him , Lord , is it I ?
KJV	Matthew	26	23	And he answered and said , He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish , the same shall betray me .
KJV	Matthew	26	24	The Son of man goeth as it is written of him : but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! it had been good for that man if he had not been born .
KJV	Matthew	26	25	Then Judas , which betrayed him , answered and said , Master , is it I ? He said unto him , Thou hast said .
KJV	Matthew	26	27	And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and gave it to them , saying , Drink ye all of it ;
KJV	Matthew	26	28	For this is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many for the remission of sins .
KJV	Matthew	26	29	But I say unto you , I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father 's kingdom .
KJV	Matthew	26	30	And when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of Olives .
KJV	Matthew	26	31	Then saith Jesus unto them , All ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad .
KJV	Matthew	26	32	But after I am risen again , I will go before you into Galilee .
KJV	Matthew	26	33	Peter answered and said unto him , Though all men shall be offended because of thee , yet will I never be offended .
KJV	Matthew	26	34	Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , That this night , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
KJV	Matthew	26	35	Peter said unto him , Though I should die with thee , yet will I not deny thee . Likewise also said all the disciples .
KJV	Matthew	26	36	Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane , and saith unto the disciples , Sit ye here , while I go and pray yonder .
KJV	Matthew	26	37	And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and very heavy .
KJV	Matthew	26	38	Then saith he unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful , even unto death : tarry ye here , and watch with me .
KJV	Matthew	26	39	And he went a little farther , and fell on his face , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from me : nevertheless not as I will , but as thou wilt .
KJV	Matthew	26	40	And he cometh unto the disciples , and findeth them asleep , and saith unto Peter , What , could ye not watch with me one hour ?
KJV	Matthew	26	41	Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
KJV	Matthew	26	42	He went away again the second time , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if this cup may not pass away from me , except I drink it , thy will be done .
KJV	Matthew	26	43	And he came and found them asleep again : for their eyes were heavy .
KJV	Matthew	26	44	And he left them , and went away again , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
KJV	Matthew	26	45	Then cometh he to his disciples , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
KJV	Matthew	26	46	Rise , let us be going : behold , he is at hand that doth betray me .
KJV	Matthew	26	47	And while he yet spake , lo , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
KJV	Matthew	26	48	Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he : hold him fast .
KJV	Matthew	26	49	And forthwith he came to Jesus , and said , Hail , master ; and kissed him .
KJV	Matthew	26	50	And Jesus said unto him , Friend , wherefore art thou come ? Then came they , and laid hands on Jesus and took him .
KJV	Matthew	26	51	And , behold , one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high priest 's , and smote off his ear .
KJV	Matthew	26	52	Then said Jesus unto him , Put up again thy sword into his place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword .
KJV	Matthew	26	53	Thinkest thou that I can not now pray to my Father , and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels ?
KJV	Matthew	26	54	But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled , that thus it must be ?
KJV	Matthew	26	55	In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes , Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me ? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple , and ye laid no hold on me .
KJV	Matthew	26	56	But all this was done , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the disciples forsook him , and fled .
KJV	Matthew	26	57	And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were assembled .
KJV	Matthew	26	58	But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest 's palace , and went in , and sat with the servants , to see the end .
KJV	Matthew	26	59	Now the chief priests , and elders , and all the council , sought false witness against Jesus , to put him to death ;
KJV	Matthew	26	60	But found none : yea , though many false witnesses came , yet found they none . At the last came two false witnesses ,
KJV	Matthew	26	61	And said , This fellow said , I am able to destroy the temple of God , and to build it in three days .
KJV	Matthew	26	62	And the high priest arose , and said unto him , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
KJV	Matthew	26	63	But Jesus held his peace , And the high priest answered and said unto him , I adjure thee by the living God , that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ , the Son of God .
KJV	Matthew	26	64	Jesus saith unto him , Thou hast said : nevertheless I say unto you , Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven .
KJV	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priest rent his clothes , saying , He hath spoken blasphemy ; what further need have we of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard his blasphemy .
KJV	Matthew	26	66	What think ye ? They answered and said , He is guilty of death .
KJV	Matthew	26	67	Then did they spit in his face , and buffeted him ; and others smote him with the palms of their hands ,
KJV	Matthew	26	68	Saying , Prophesy unto us , thou Christ , Who is he that smote thee ?
KJV	Matthew	26	69	Now Peter sat without in the palace : and a damsel came unto him , saying , Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee .
KJV	Matthew	26	70	But he denied before them all , saying , I know not what thou sayest .
KJV	Matthew	26	71	And when he was gone out into the porch , another maid saw him , and said unto them that were there , This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth .
KJV	Matthew	26	72	And again he denied with an oath , I do not know the man .
KJV	Matthew	26	73	And after a while came unto him they that stood by , and said to Peter , Surely thou also art one of them ; for thy speech bewrayeth thee .
KJV	Matthew	26	74	Then began he to curse and to swear , saying , I know not the man . And immediately the cock crew .
KJV	Matthew	26	75	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus , which said unto him , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . And he went out , and wept bitterly .
KJV	Matthew	27	27	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall , and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers .
KJV	Matthew	27	2	And when they had bound him , they led him away , and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor .
KJV	Matthew	27	3	Then Judas , which had betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , repented himself , and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
KJV	Matthew	27	4	Saying , I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood . And they said , What is that to us ? see thou to that .
KJV	Matthew	27	5	And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple , and departed , and went and hanged himself .
KJV	Matthew	27	6	And the chief priests took the silver pieces , and said , It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury , because it is the price of blood .
KJV	Matthew	27	7	And they took counsel , and bought with them the potter 's field , to bury strangers in .
KJV	Matthew	27	8	Wherefore that field was called , The field of blood , unto this day .
KJV	Matthew	27	9	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet , saying , And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him that was valued , whom they of the children of Israel did value ;
KJV	Matthew	27	10	And gave them for the potter 's field , as the Lord appointed me .
KJV	Matthew	27	11	And Jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And Jesus said unto him , Thou sayest .
KJV	Matthew	27	12	And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .
KJV	Matthew	27	13	Then said Pilate unto him , Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee ?
KJV	Matthew	27	14	And he answered him to never a word ; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly .
KJV	Matthew	27	15	Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner , whom they would .
KJV	Matthew	27	16	And they had then a notable prisoner , called Barabbas .
KJV	Matthew	27	17	Therefore when they were gathered together , Pilate said unto them , Whom will ye that I release unto you ? Barabbas , or Jesus which is called Christ ?
KJV	Matthew	27	18	For he knew that for envy they had delivered him .
KJV	Matthew	27	19	When he was set down on the judgment seat , his wife sent unto him , saying , Have thou nothing to do with that just man : for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him .
KJV	Matthew	27	20	But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas , and destroy Jesus .
KJV	Matthew	27	21	The governor answered and said unto them , Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you ? They said , Barabbas .
KJV	Matthew	27	22	Pilate saith unto them , What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ ? They all say unto him , Let him be crucified .
KJV	Matthew	27	23	And the governor said , Why , what evil hath he done ? But they cried out the more , saying , Let him be crucified .
KJV	Matthew	27	24	When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing , but that rather a tumult was made , he took water , and washed his hands before the multitude , saying , I am innocent of the blood of this just person : see ye to it .
KJV	Matthew	27	25	Then answered all the people , and said , His blood be on us , and on our children .
KJV	Matthew	27	26	Then released he Barabbas unto them : and when he had scourged Jesus , he delivered him to be crucified .
KJV	Matthew	27	28	And they stripped him , and put on him a scarlet robe .
KJV	Matthew	27	29	And when they had platted a crown of thorns , they put it upon his head , and a reed in his right hand : and they bowed the knee before him , and mocked him , saying , Hail , King of the Jews !
KJV	Matthew	27	30	And they spit upon him , and took the reed , and smote him on the head .
KJV	Matthew	27	31	And after that they had mocked him , they took the robe off from him , and put his own raiment on him , and led him away to crucify him .
KJV	Matthew	27	32	And as they came out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name : him they compelled to bear his cross .
KJV	Matthew	27	33	And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha , that is to say , a place of a skull ,
KJV	Matthew	27	34	They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall : and when he had tasted thereof , he would not drink .
KJV	Matthew	27	35	And they crucified him , and parted his garments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , They parted my garments among them , and upon my vesture did they cast lots .
KJV	Matthew	27	36	And sitting down they watched him there ;
KJV	Matthew	27	37	And set up over his head his accusation written , This Is Jesus The King Of The Jews .
KJV	Matthew	27	38	Then were there two thieves crucified with him , one on the right hand , and another on the left .
KJV	Matthew	27	39	And they that passed by reviled him , wagging their heads ,
KJV	Matthew	27	40	And saying , Thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days , save thyself . If thou be the Son of God , come down from the cross .
KJV	Matthew	27	41	Likewise also the chief priests mocking him , with the scribes and elders , said ,
KJV	Matthew	27	42	He saved others ; himself he can not save . If he be the King of Israel , let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe him .
KJV	Matthew	27	43	He trusted in God ; let him deliver him now , if he will have him : for he said , I am the Son of God .
KJV	Matthew	27	44	The thieves also , which were crucified with him , cast the same in his teeth .
KJV	Matthew	27	45	Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour .
KJV	Matthew	27	46	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? that is to say , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ?
KJV	Matthew	27	47	Some of them that stood there , when they heard that , said , This man calleth for Elias .
KJV	Matthew	27	48	And straightway one of them ran , and took a spunge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink .
KJV	Matthew	27	49	The rest said , Let be , let us see whether Elias will come to save him .
KJV	Matthew	27	50	Jesus , when he had cried again with a loud voice , yielded up the ghost .
KJV	Matthew	27	51	And , behold , the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom ; and the earth did quake , and the rocks rent ;
KJV	Matthew	27	52	And the graves were opened ; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose ,
KJV	Matthew	27	53	And came out of the graves after his resurrection , and went into the holy city , and appeared unto many .
KJV	Matthew	27	54	Now when the centurion , and they that were with him , watching Jesus , saw the earthquake , and those things that were done , they feared greatly , saying , Truly this was the Son of God .
KJV	Matthew	27	55	And many women were there beholding afar off , which followed Jesus from Galilee , ministering unto him :
KJV	Matthew	27	56	Among which was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of Zebedees children .
KJV	Matthew	27	57	When the even was come , there came a rich man of Arimathaea , named Joseph , who also himself was Jesus ' disciple :
KJV	Matthew	27	58	He went to Pilate , and begged the body of Jesus . Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered .
KJV	Matthew	27	59	And when Joseph had taken the body , he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
KJV	Matthew	27	60	And laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out in the rock : and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre , and departed .
KJV	Matthew	27	61	And there was Mary Magdalene , and the other Mary , sitting over against the sepulchre .
KJV	Matthew	27	62	Now the next day , that followed the day of the preparation , the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate ,
KJV	Matthew	27	63	Saying , Sir , we remember that that deceiver said , while he was yet alive , After three days I will rise again .
KJV	Matthew	27	64	Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day , lest his disciples come by night , and steal him away , and say unto the people , He is risen from the dead : so the last error shall be worse than the first .
KJV	Matthew	27	65	Pilate said unto them , Ye have a watch : go your way , make it as sure as ye can .
KJV	Matthew	27	66	So they went , and made the sepulchre sure , sealing the stone , and setting a watch .
KJV	Matthew	28	28	In the end of the sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre .
KJV	Matthew	28	2	And , behold , there was a great earthquake : for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it .
KJV	Matthew	28	3	His countenance was like lightning , and his raiment white as snow :
KJV	Matthew	28	4	And for fear of him the keepers did shake , and became as dead men .
KJV	Matthew	28	5	And the angel answered and said unto the women , Fear not ye : for I know that ye seek Jesus , which was crucified .
KJV	Matthew	28	6	He is not here : for he is risen , as he said . Come , see the place where the Lord lay .
KJV	Matthew	28	7	And go quickly , and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead ; and , behold , he goeth before you into Galilee ; there shall ye see him : lo , I have told you .
KJV	Matthew	28	8	And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy ; and did run to bring his disciples word .
KJV	Matthew	28	9	And as they went to tell his disciples , behold , Jesus met them , saying , All hail . And they came and held him by the feet , and worshipped him .
KJV	Matthew	28	10	Then said Jesus unto them , Be not afraid : go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee , and there shall they see me .
KJV	Matthew	28	11	Now when they were going , behold , some of the watch came into the city , and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done .
KJV	Matthew	28	12	And when they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave large money unto the soldiers ,
KJV	Matthew	28	13	Saying , Say ye , His disciples came by night , and stole him away while we slept .
KJV	Matthew	28	14	And if this come to the governor 's ears , we will persuade him , and secure you .
KJV	Matthew	28	15	So they took the money , and did as they were taught : and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day .
KJV	Matthew	28	16	Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee , into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them .
KJV	Matthew	28	17	And when they saw him , they worshipped him : but some doubted .
KJV	Matthew	28	18	And Jesus came and spake unto them , saying , All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth .
KJV	Matthew	28	19	Go ye therefore , and teach all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost :
KJV	Matthew	28	20	Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you : and , lo , I am with you always , even unto the end of the world . Amen .
KJV	Mark	1	1	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God ;
KJV	Mark	1	2	As it is written in the prophets , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
KJV	Mark	1	3	The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight .
KJV	Mark	1	4	John did baptize in the wilderness , and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins .
KJV	Mark	1	5	And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea , and they of Jerusalem , and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan , confessing their sins .
KJV	Mark	1	6	And John was clothed with camel 's hair , and with a girdle of a skin about his loins ; and he did eat locusts and wild honey ;
KJV	Mark	1	7	And preached , saying , There cometh one mightier than I after me , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose .
KJV	Mark	1	8	I indeed have baptized you with water : but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost .
KJV	Mark	1	9	And it came to pass in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized of John in Jordan .
KJV	Mark	1	10	And straightway coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens opened , and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him :
KJV	Mark	1	11	And there came a voice from heaven , saying , Thou art my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
KJV	Mark	1	12	And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness .
KJV	Mark	1	13	And he was there in the wilderness forty days , tempted of Satan ; and was with the wild beasts ; and the angels ministered unto him .
KJV	Mark	1	14	Now after that John was put in prison , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God ,
KJV	Mark	1	15	And saying , The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand : repent ye , and believe the gospel .
KJV	Mark	1	16	Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
KJV	Mark	1	17	And Jesus said unto them , Come ye after me , and I will make you to become fishers of men .
KJV	Mark	1	18	And straightway they forsook their nets , and followed him .
KJV	Mark	1	19	And when he had gone a little farther thence , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who also were in the ship mending their nets .
KJV	Mark	1	20	And straightway he called them : and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants , and went after him .
KJV	Mark	1	21	And they went into Capernaum ; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue , and taught .
KJV	Mark	1	22	And they were astonished at his doctrine : for he taught them as one that had authority , and not as the scribes .
KJV	Mark	1	23	And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
KJV	Mark	1	24	Saying , Let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the Holy One of God .
KJV	Mark	1	25	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him .
KJV	Mark	1	26	And when the unclean spirit had torn him , and cried with a loud voice , he came out of him .
KJV	Mark	1	27	And they were all amazed , insomuch that they questioned among themselves , saying , What thing is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits , and they do obey him .
KJV	Mark	1	28	And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee .
KJV	Mark	1	29	And forthwith , when they were come out of the synagogue , they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
KJV	Mark	1	30	But Simon 's wife 's mother lay sick of a fever , and anon they tell him of her .
KJV	Mark	1	31	And he came and took her by the hand , and lifted her up ; and immediately the fever left her , and she ministered unto them .
KJV	Mark	1	32	And at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were diseased , and them that were possessed with devils .
KJV	Mark	1	33	And all the city was gathered together at the door .
KJV	Mark	1	34	And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases , and cast out many devils ; and suffered not the devils to speak , because they knew him .
KJV	Mark	1	35	And in the morning , rising up a great while before day , he went out , and departed into a solitary place , and there prayed .
KJV	Mark	1	36	And Simon and they that were with him followed after him .
KJV	Mark	1	37	And when they had found him , they said unto him , All men seek for thee .
KJV	Mark	1	38	And he said unto them , Let us go into the next towns , that I may preach there also : for therefore came I forth .
KJV	Mark	1	39	And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee , and cast out devils .
KJV	Mark	1	40	And there came a leper to him , beseeching him , and kneeling down to him , and saying unto him , If thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
KJV	Mark	1	41	And Jesus , moved with compassion , put forth his hand , and touched him , and saith unto him , I will ; be thou clean .
KJV	Mark	1	42	And as soon as he had spoken , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was cleansed .
KJV	Mark	1	43	And he straitly charged him , and forthwith sent him away ;
KJV	Mark	1	44	And saith unto him , See thou say nothing to any man : but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
KJV	Mark	1	45	But he went out , and began to publish it much , and to blaze abroad the matter , insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city , but was without in desert places : and they came to him from every quarter .
KJV	Mark	2	2	And straightway many were gathered together , insomuch that there was no room to receive them , no , not so much as about the door : and he preached the word unto them .
KJV	Mark	2	3	And they come unto him , bringing one sick of the palsy , which was borne of four .
KJV	Mark	2	4	And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press , they uncovered the roof where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay .
KJV	Mark	2	5	When Jesus saw their faith , he said unto the sick of the palsy , Son , thy sins be forgiven thee .
KJV	Mark	2	6	But there was certain of the scribes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts ,
KJV	Mark	2	7	Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies ? who can forgive sins but God only ?
KJV	Mark	2	8	And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , he said unto them , Why reason ye these things in your hearts ?
KJV	Mark	2	9	Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Arise , and take up thy bed , and walk ?
KJV	Mark	2	10	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( he saith to the sick of the palsy , )
KJV	Mark	2	11	I say unto thee , Arise , and take up thy bed , and go thy way into thine house .
KJV	Mark	2	12	And immediately he arose , took up the bed , and went forth before them all ; insomuch that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , We never saw it on this fashion .
KJV	Mark	2	13	And he went forth again by the sea side ; and all the multitude resorted unto him , and he taught them .
KJV	Mark	2	14	And as he passed by , he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom , and said unto him , Follow me . And he arose and followed him .
KJV	Mark	2	15	And it came to pass , that , as Jesus sat at meat in his house , many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him .
KJV	Mark	2	16	And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners , they said unto his disciples , How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners ?
KJV	Mark	2	17	When Jesus heard it , he saith unto them , They that are whole have no need of the physician , but they that are sick : I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
KJV	Mark	2	18	And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast : and they come and say unto him , Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast , but thy disciples fast not ?
KJV	Mark	2	19	And Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they can not fast .
KJV	Mark	2	20	But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
KJV	Mark	2	21	No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment : else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old , and the rent is made worse .
KJV	Mark	2	22	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles : else the new wine doth burst the bottles , and the wine is spilled , and the bottles will be marred : but new wine must be put into new bottles .
KJV	Mark	2	23	And it came to pass , that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day ; and his disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears of corn .
KJV	Mark	2	24	And the Pharisees said unto him , Behold , why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful ?
KJV	Mark	2	25	And he said unto them , Have ye never read what David did , when he had need , and was an hungred , he , and they that were with him ?
KJV	Mark	2	26	How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest , and did eat the shewbread , which is not lawful to eat but for the priests , and gave also to them which were with him ?
KJV	Mark	2	27	And he said unto them , The sabbath was made for man , and not man for the sabbath :
KJV	Mark	2	28	Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath .
KJV	Mark	3	3	And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand , Stand forth .
KJV	Mark	3	2	And they watched him , whether he would heal him on the sabbath day ; that they might accuse him .
KJV	Mark	3	4	And he saith unto them , Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days , or to do evil ? to save life , or to kill ? But they held their peace .
KJV	Mark	3	5	And when he had looked round about on them with anger , being grieved for the hardness of their hearts , he saith unto the man , Stretch forth thine hand . And he stretched it out : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
KJV	Mark	3	6	And the Pharisees went forth , and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him , how they might destroy him .
KJV	Mark	3	7	But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea : and a great multitude from Galilee followed him , and from Judaea ,
KJV	Mark	3	8	And from Jerusalem , and from Idumaea , and from beyond Jordan ; and they about Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , when they had heard what great things he did , came unto him .
KJV	Mark	3	9	And he spake to his disciples , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude , lest they should throng him .
KJV	Mark	3	10	For he had healed many ; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him , as many as had plagues .
KJV	Mark	3	11	And unclean spirits , when they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , Thou art the Son of God .
KJV	Mark	3	12	And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known .
KJV	Mark	3	13	And he goeth up into a mountain , and calleth unto him whom he would : and they came unto him .
KJV	Mark	3	14	And he ordained twelve , that they should be with him , and that he might send them forth to preach ,
KJV	Mark	3	15	And to have power to heal sicknesses , and to cast out devils :
KJV	Mark	3	16	And Simon he surnamed Peter ;
KJV	Mark	3	17	And James the son of Zebedee , and John the brother of James ; and he surnamed them Boanerges , which is , The sons of thunder :
KJV	Mark	3	18	And Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus , and Simon the Canaanite ,
KJV	Mark	3	19	And Judas Iscariot , which also betrayed him : and they went into an house .
KJV	Mark	3	20	And the multitude cometh together again , so that they could not so much as eat bread .
KJV	Mark	3	21	And when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is beside himself .
KJV	Mark	3	22	And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said , He hath Beelzebub , and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils .
KJV	Mark	3	23	And he called them unto him , and said unto them in parables , How can Satan cast out Satan ?
KJV	Mark	3	24	And if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand .
KJV	Mark	3	25	And if a house be divided against itself , that house can not stand .
KJV	Mark	3	26	And if Satan rise up against himself , and be divided , he can not stand , but hath an end .
KJV	Mark	3	27	No man can enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he will first bind the strong man ; and then he will spoil his house .
KJV	Mark	3	28	Verily I say unto you , All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men , and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme :
KJV	Mark	3	29	But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness , but is in danger of eternal damnation .
KJV	Mark	3	30	Because they said , He hath an unclean spirit .
KJV	Mark	3	31	There came then his brethren and his mother , and , standing without , sent unto him , calling him .
KJV	Mark	3	32	And the multitude sat about him , and they said unto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee .
KJV	Mark	3	33	And he answered them , saying , Who is my mother , or my brethren ?
KJV	Mark	3	34	And he looked round about on them which sat about him , and said , Behold my mother and my brethren !
KJV	Mark	3	35	For whosoever shall do the will of God , the same is my brother , and my sister , and mother .
KJV	Mark	4	4	And it came to pass , as he sowed , some fell by the way side , and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up .
KJV	Mark	4	2	And he taught them many things by parables , and said unto them in his doctrine ,
KJV	Mark	4	3	Hearken ; Behold , there went out a sower to sow :
KJV	Mark	4	5	And some fell on stony ground , where it had not much earth ; and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of earth :
KJV	Mark	4	6	But when the sun was up , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
KJV	Mark	4	7	And some fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up , and choked it , and it yielded no fruit .
KJV	Mark	4	8	And other fell on good ground , and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased ; and brought forth , some thirty , and some sixty , and some an hundred .
KJV	Mark	4	9	And he said unto them , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
KJV	Mark	4	10	And when he was alone , they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable .
KJV	Mark	4	11	And he said unto them , Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God : but unto them that are without , all these things are done in parables :
KJV	Mark	4	12	That seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest at any time they should be converted , and their sins should be forgiven them .
KJV	Mark	4	13	And he said unto them , Know ye not this parable ? and how then will ye know all parables ?
KJV	Mark	4	14	The sower soweth the word .
KJV	Mark	4	15	And these are they by the way side , where the word is sown ; but when they have heard , Satan cometh immediately , and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts .
KJV	Mark	4	16	And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground ; who , when they have heard the word , immediately receive it with gladness ;
KJV	Mark	4	17	And have no root in themselves , and so endure but for a time : afterward , when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word 's sake , immediately they are offended .
KJV	Mark	4	18	And these are they which are sown among thorns ; such as hear the word ,
KJV	Mark	4	19	And the cares of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts of other things entering in , choke the word , and it becometh unfruitful .
KJV	Mark	4	20	And these are they which are sown on good ground ; such as hear the word , and receive it , and bring forth fruit , some thirtyfold , some sixty , and some an hundred .
KJV	Mark	4	21	And he said unto them , Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel , or under a bed ? and not to be set on a candlestick ?
KJV	Mark	4	22	For there is nothing hid , which shall not be manifested ; neither was any thing kept secret , but that it should come abroad .
KJV	Mark	4	23	If any man have ears to hear , let him hear .
KJV	Mark	4	24	And he said unto them , Take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you : and unto you that hear shall more be given .
KJV	Mark	4	25	For he that hath , to him shall be given : and he that hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he hath .
KJV	Mark	4	26	And he said , So is the kingdom of God , as if a man should cast seed into the ground ;
KJV	Mark	4	27	And should sleep , and rise night and day , and the seed should spring and grow up , he knoweth not how .
KJV	Mark	4	28	For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself ; first the blade , then the ear , after that the full corn in the ear .
KJV	Mark	4	29	But when the fruit is brought forth , immediately he putteth in the sickle , because the harvest is come .
KJV	Mark	4	30	And he said , Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God ? or with what comparison shall we compare it ?
KJV	Mark	4	31	It is like a grain of mustard seed , which , when it is sown in the earth , is less than all the seeds that be in the earth :
KJV	Mark	4	32	But when it is sown , it groweth up , and becometh greater than all herbs , and shooteth out great branches ; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it .
KJV	Mark	4	33	And with many such parables spake he the word unto them , as they were able to hear it .
KJV	Mark	4	34	But without a parable spake he not unto them : and when they were alone , he expounded all things to his disciples .
KJV	Mark	4	35	And the same day , when the even was come , he saith unto them , Let us pass over unto the other side .
KJV	Mark	4	36	And when they had sent away the multitude , they took him even as he was in the ship . And there were also with him other little ships .
KJV	Mark	4	37	And there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it was now full .
KJV	Mark	4	38	And he was in the hinder part of the ship , asleep on a pillow : and they awake him , and say unto him , Master , carest thou not that we perish ?
KJV	Mark	4	39	And he arose , and rebuked the wind , and said unto the sea , Peace , be still . And the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
KJV	Mark	4	40	And he said unto them , Why are ye so fearful ? how is it that ye have no faith ?
KJV	Mark	4	41	And they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , What manner of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ?
KJV	Mark	5	5	And always , night and day , he was in the mountains , and in the tombs , crying , and cutting himself with stones .
KJV	Mark	5	2	And when he was come out of the ship , immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
KJV	Mark	5	3	Who had his dwelling among the tombs ; and no man could bind him , no , not with chains :
KJV	Mark	5	4	Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been plucked asunder by him , and the fetters broken in pieces : neither could any man tame him .
KJV	Mark	5	6	But when he saw Jesus afar off , he ran and worshipped him ,
KJV	Mark	5	7	And cried with a loud voice , and said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of the most high God ? I adjure thee by God , that thou torment me not .
KJV	Mark	5	8	For he said unto him , Come out of the man , thou unclean spirit .
KJV	Mark	5	9	And he asked him , What is thy name ? And he answered , saying , My name is Legion : for we are many .
KJV	Mark	5	10	And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country .
KJV	Mark	5	11	Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding .
KJV	Mark	5	12	And all the devils besought him , saying , Send us into the swine , that we may enter into them .
KJV	Mark	5	13	And forthwith Jesus gave them leave . And the unclean spirits went out , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea , ( they were about two thousand ; ) and were choked in the sea .
KJV	Mark	5	14	And they that fed the swine fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . And they went out to see what it was that was done .
KJV	Mark	5	15	And they come to Jesus , and see him that was possessed with the devil , and had the legion , sitting , and clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
KJV	Mark	5	16	And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil , and also concerning the swine .
KJV	Mark	5	17	And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts .
KJV	Mark	5	18	And when he was come into the ship , he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him .
KJV	Mark	5	19	Howbeit Jesus suffered him not , but saith unto him , Go home to thy friends , and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee , and hath had compassion on thee .
KJV	Mark	5	20	And he departed , and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him : and all men did marvel .
KJV	Mark	5	21	And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side , much people gathered unto him : and he was nigh unto the sea .
KJV	Mark	5	22	And , behold , there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue , Jairus by name ; and when he saw him , he fell at his feet ,
KJV	Mark	5	23	And besought him greatly , saying , My little daughter lieth at the point of death : I pray thee , come and lay thy hands on her , that she may be healed ; and she shall live .
KJV	Mark	5	24	And Jesus went with him ; and much people followed him , and thronged him .
KJV	Mark	5	25	And a certain woman , which had an issue of blood twelve years ,
KJV	Mark	5	26	And had suffered many things of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bettered , but rather grew worse ,
KJV	Mark	5	27	When she had heard of Jesus , came in the press behind , and touched his garment .
KJV	Mark	5	28	For she said , If I may touch but his clothes , I shall be whole .
KJV	Mark	5	29	And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague .
KJV	Mark	5	30	And Jesus , immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him , turned him about in the press , and said , Who touched my clothes ?
KJV	Mark	5	31	And his disciples said unto him , Thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ?
KJV	Mark	5	32	And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing .
KJV	Mark	5	33	But the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what was done in her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
KJV	Mark	5	34	And he said unto her , Daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace , and be whole of thy plague .
KJV	Mark	5	35	While he yet spake , there came from the ruler of the synagogue 's house certain which said , Thy daughter is dead : why troublest thou the Master any further ?
KJV	Mark	5	36	As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken , he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue , Be not afraid , only believe .
KJV	Mark	5	37	And he suffered no man to follow him , save Peter , and James , and John the brother of James .
KJV	Mark	5	38	And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and seeth the tumult , and them that wept and wailed greatly .
KJV	Mark	5	39	And when he was come in , he saith unto them , Why make ye this ado , and weep ? the damsel is not dead , but sleepeth .
KJV	Mark	5	40	And they laughed him to scorn . But when he had put them all out , he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel , and them that were with him , and entereth in where the damsel was lying .
KJV	Mark	5	41	And he took the damsel by the hand , and said unto her , Talitha cumi ; which is , being interpreted , Damsel , I say unto thee , arise .
KJV	Mark	5	42	And straightway the damsel arose , and walked ; for she was of the age of twelve years . And they were astonished with a great astonishment .
KJV	Mark	5	43	And he charged them straitly that no man should know it ; and commanded that something should be given her to eat .
KJV	Mark	6	6	And he marvelled because of their unbelief . And he went round about the villages , teaching .
KJV	Mark	6	2	And when the sabbath day was come , he began to teach in the synagogue : and many hearing him were astonished , saying , From whence hath this man these things ? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him , that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands ?
KJV	Mark	6	3	Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary , the brother of James , and Joses , and of Juda , and Simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? And they were offended at him .
KJV	Mark	6	4	But Jesus , said unto them , A prophet is not without honour , but in his own country , and among his own kin , and in his own house .
KJV	Mark	6	5	And he could there do no mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them .
KJV	Mark	6	7	And he called unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and gave them power over unclean spirits ;
KJV	Mark	6	8	And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey , save a staff only ; no scrip , no bread , no money in their purse :
KJV	Mark	6	9	But be shod with sandals ; and not put on two coats .
KJV	Mark	6	10	And he said unto them , In what place soever ye enter into an house , there abide till ye depart from that place .
KJV	Mark	6	11	And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear you , when ye depart thence , shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them . Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
KJV	Mark	6	12	And they went out , and preached that men should repent .
KJV	Mark	6	13	And they cast out many devils , and anointed with oil many that were sick , and healed them .
KJV	Mark	6	14	And king Herod heard of him ; ( for his name was spread abroad : ) and he said , That John the Baptist was risen from the dead , and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
KJV	Mark	6	15	Others said , That it is Elias . And others said , That it is a prophet , or as one of the prophets .
KJV	Mark	6	16	But when Herod heard thereof , he said , It is John , whom I beheaded : he is risen from the dead .
KJV	Mark	6	17	For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John , and bound him in prison for Herodias ' sake , his brother Philip 's wife : for he had married her .
KJV	Mark	6	18	For John had said unto Herod , It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother 's wife .
KJV	Mark	6	19	Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him , and would have killed him ; but she could not :
KJV	Mark	6	20	For Herod feared John , knowing that he was a just man and an holy , and observed him ; and when he heard him , he did many things , and heard him gladly .
KJV	Mark	6	21	And when a convenient day was come , that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords , high captains , and chief estates of Galilee ;
KJV	Mark	6	22	And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in , and danced , and pleased Herod and them that sat with him , the king said unto the damsel , Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt , and I will give it thee .
KJV	Mark	6	23	And he sware unto her , Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , I will give it thee , unto the half of my kingdom .
KJV	Mark	6	24	And she went forth , and said unto her mother , What shall I ask ? And she said , The head of John the Baptist .
KJV	Mark	6	25	And she came in straightway with haste unto the king , and asked , saying , I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist .
KJV	Mark	6	26	And the king was exceeding sorry ; yet for his oath 's sake , and for their sakes which sat with him , he would not reject her .
KJV	Mark	6	27	And immediately the king sent an executioner , and commanded his head to be brought : and he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
KJV	Mark	6	28	And brought his head in a charger , and gave it to the damsel : and the damsel gave it to her mother .
KJV	Mark	6	29	And when his disciples heard of it , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
KJV	Mark	6	30	And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught .
KJV	Mark	6	31	And he said unto them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while : for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
KJV	Mark	6	32	And they departed into a desert place by ship privately .
KJV	Mark	6	33	And the people saw them departing , and many knew him , and ran afoot thither out of all cities , and outwent them , and came together unto him .
KJV	Mark	6	34	And Jesus , when he came out , saw much people , and was moved with compassion toward them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd : and he began to teach them many things .
KJV	Mark	6	35	And when the day was now far spent , his disciples came unto him , and said , This is a desert place , and now the time is far passed :
KJV	Mark	6	36	Send them away , that they may go into the country round about , and into the villages , and buy themselves bread : for they have nothing to eat .
KJV	Mark	6	37	He answered and said unto them , Give ye them to eat . And they say unto him , Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread , and give them to eat ?
KJV	Mark	6	38	He saith unto them , How many loaves have ye ? go and see . And when they knew , they say , Five , and two fishes .
KJV	Mark	6	39	And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass .
KJV	Mark	6	40	And they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fifties .
KJV	Mark	6	41	And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed , and brake the loaves , and gave them to his disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes divided he among them all .
KJV	Mark	6	42	And they did all eat , and were filled .
KJV	Mark	6	43	And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments , and of the fishes .
KJV	Mark	6	44	And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men .
KJV	Mark	6	45	And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship , and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida , while he sent away the people .
KJV	Mark	6	46	And when he had sent them away , he departed into a mountain to pray .
KJV	Mark	6	47	And when even was come , the ship was in the midst of the sea , and he alone on the land .
KJV	Mark	6	48	And he saw them toiling in rowing ; for the wind was contrary unto them : and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them , walking upon the sea , and would have passed by them .
KJV	Mark	6	49	But when they saw him walking upon the sea , they supposed it had been a spirit , and cried out :
KJV	Mark	6	50	For they all saw him , and were troubled . And immediately he talked with them , and saith unto them , Be of good cheer : it is I ; be not afraid .
KJV	Mark	6	51	And he went up unto them into the ship ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure , and wondered .
KJV	Mark	6	52	For they considered not the miracle of the loaves : for their heart was hardened .
KJV	Mark	6	53	And when they had passed over , they came into the land of Gennesaret , and drew to the shore .
KJV	Mark	6	54	And when they were come out of the ship , straightway they knew him ,
KJV	Mark	6	55	And ran through that whole region round about , and began to carry about in beds those that were sick , where they heard he was .
KJV	Mark	6	56	And whithersoever he entered , into villages , or cities , or country , they laid the sick in the streets , and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment : and as many as touched him were made whole .
KJV	Mark	7	7	Howbeit in vain do they worship me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men .
KJV	Mark	7	2	And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled , that is to say , with unwashen , hands , they found fault .
KJV	Mark	7	3	For the Pharisees , and all the Jews , except they wash their hands oft , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders .
KJV	Mark	7	4	And when they come from the market , except they wash , they eat not . And many other things there be , which they have received to hold , as the washing of cups , and pots , brasen vessels , and of tables .
KJV	Mark	7	5	Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him , Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders , but eat bread with unwashen hands ?
KJV	Mark	7	6	He answered and said unto them , Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites , as it is written , This people honoureth me with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
KJV	Mark	7	8	For laying aside the commandment of God , ye hold the tradition of men , as the washing of pots and cups : and many other such like things ye do .
KJV	Mark	7	9	And he said unto them , Full well ye reject the commandment of God , that ye may keep your own tradition .
KJV	Mark	7	10	For Moses said , Honour thy father and thy mother ; and , Whoso curseth father or mother , let him die the death :
KJV	Mark	7	11	But ye say , If a man shall say to his father or mother , It is Corban , that is to say , a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me ; he shall be free .
KJV	Mark	7	12	And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother ;
KJV	Mark	7	13	Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition , which ye have delivered : and many such like things do ye .
KJV	Mark	7	14	And when he had called all the people unto him , he said unto them , Hearken unto me every one of you , and understand :
KJV	Mark	7	15	There is nothing from without a man , that entering into him can defile him : but the things which come out of him , those are they that defile the man .
KJV	Mark	7	16	If any man have ears to hear , let him hear .
KJV	Mark	7	17	And when he was entered into the house from the people , his disciples asked him concerning the parable .
KJV	Mark	7	18	And he saith unto them , Are ye so without understanding also ? Do ye not perceive , that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man , it can not defile him ;
KJV	Mark	7	19	Because it entereth not into his heart , but into the belly , and goeth out into the draught , purging all meats ?
KJV	Mark	7	20	And he said , That which cometh out of the man , that defileth the man .
KJV	Mark	7	21	For from within , out of the heart of men , proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders ,
KJV	Mark	7	22	Thefts , covetousness , wickedness , deceit , lasciviousness , an evil eye , blasphemy , pride , foolishness :
KJV	Mark	7	23	All these evil things come from within , and defile the man .
KJV	Mark	7	24	And from thence he arose , and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and entered into an house , and would have no man know it : but he could not be hid .
KJV	Mark	7	25	For a certain woman , whose young daughter had an unclean spirit , heard of him , and came and fell at his feet :
KJV	Mark	7	26	The woman was a Greek , a Syrophenician by nation ; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter .
KJV	Mark	7	27	But Jesus said unto her , Let the children first be filled : for it is not meet to take the children 's bread , and to cast it unto the dogs .
KJV	Mark	7	28	And she answered and said unto him , Yes , Lord : yet the dogs under the table eat of the children 's crumbs .
KJV	Mark	7	29	And he said unto her , For this saying go thy way ; the devil is gone out of thy daughter .
KJV	Mark	7	30	And when she was come to her house , she found the devil gone out , and her daughter laid upon the bed .
KJV	Mark	7	31	And again , departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon , he came unto the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis .
KJV	Mark	7	32	And they bring unto him one that was deaf , and had an impediment in his speech ; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him .
KJV	Mark	7	33	And he took him aside from the multitude , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spit , and touched his tongue ;
KJV	Mark	7	34	And looking up to heaven , he sighed , and saith unto him , Ephphatha , that is , Be opened .
KJV	Mark	7	35	And straightway his ears were opened , and the string of his tongue was loosed , and he spake plain .
KJV	Mark	7	36	And he charged them that they should tell no man : but the more he charged them , so much the more a great deal they published it ;
KJV	Mark	7	37	And were beyond measure astonished , saying , He hath done all things well : he maketh both the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak .
KJV	Mark	8	8	So they did eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets .
KJV	Mark	8	2	I have compassion on the multitude , because they have now been with me three days , and have nothing to eat :
KJV	Mark	8	3	And if I send them away fasting to their own houses , they will faint by the way : for divers of them came from far .
KJV	Mark	8	4	And his disciples answered him , From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness ?
KJV	Mark	8	5	And he asked them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven .
KJV	Mark	8	6	And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven loaves , and gave thanks , and brake , and gave to his disciples to set before them ; and they did set them before the people .
KJV	Mark	8	7	And they had a few small fishes : and he blessed , and commanded to set them also before them .
KJV	Mark	8	9	And they that had eaten were about four thousand : and he sent them away .
KJV	Mark	8	10	And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples , and came into the parts of Dalmanutha .
KJV	Mark	8	11	And the Pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heaven , tempting him .
KJV	Mark	8	12	And he sighed deeply in his spirit , and saith , Why doth this generation seek after a sign ? verily I say unto you , There shall no sign be given unto this generation .
KJV	Mark	8	13	And he left them , and entering into the ship again departed to the other side .
KJV	Mark	8	14	Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread , neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf .
KJV	Mark	8	15	And he charged them , saying , Take heed , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , and of the leaven of Herod .
KJV	Mark	8	16	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have no bread .
KJV	Mark	8	17	And when Jesus knew it , he saith unto them , Why reason ye , because ye have no bread ? perceive ye not yet , neither understand ? have ye your heart yet hardened ?
KJV	Mark	8	18	Having eyes , see ye not ? and having ears , hear ye not ? and do ye not remember ?
KJV	Mark	8	19	When I brake the five loaves among five thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? They say unto him , Twelve .
KJV	Mark	8	20	And when the seven among four thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? And they said , Seven .
KJV	Mark	8	21	And he said unto them , How is it that ye do not understand ?
KJV	Mark	8	22	And he cometh to Bethsaida ; and they bring a blind man unto him , and besought him to touch him .
KJV	Mark	8	23	And he took the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had spit on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw ought .
KJV	Mark	8	24	And he looked up , and said , I see men as trees , walking .
KJV	Mark	8	25	After that he put his hands again upon his eyes , and made him look up : and he was restored , and saw every man clearly .
KJV	Mark	8	26	And he sent him away to his house , saying , Neither go into the town , nor tell it to any in the town .
KJV	Mark	8	27	And Jesus went out , and his disciples , into the towns of Caesarea Philippi : and by the way he asked his disciples , saying unto them , Whom do men say that I am ?
KJV	Mark	8	28	And they answered , John the Baptist ; but some say , Elias ; and others , One of the prophets .
KJV	Mark	8	29	And he saith unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? And Peter answereth and saith unto him , Thou art the Christ .
KJV	Mark	8	30	And he charged them that they should tell no man of him .
KJV	Mark	8	31	And he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders , and of the chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
KJV	Mark	8	32	And he spake that saying openly . And Peter took him , and began to rebuke him .
KJV	Mark	8	33	But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples , he rebuked Peter , saying , Get thee behind me , Satan : for thou savourest not the things that be of God , but the things that be of men .
KJV	Mark	8	34	And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also , he said unto them , Whosoever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
KJV	Mark	8	35	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel 's , the same shall save it .
KJV	Mark	8	36	For what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
KJV	Mark	8	37	Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
KJV	Mark	8	38	Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation ; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels .
KJV	Mark	9	9	And as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , till the Son of man were risen from the dead .
KJV	Mark	9	2	And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter , and James , and John , and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves : and he was transfigured before them .
KJV	Mark	9	3	And his raiment became shining , exceeding white as snow ; so as no fuller on earth can white them .
KJV	Mark	9	4	And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses : and they were talking with Jesus .
KJV	Mark	9	5	And Peter answered and said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias .
KJV	Mark	9	6	For he wist not what to say ; for they were sore afraid .
KJV	Mark	9	7	And there was a cloud that overshadowed them : and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him .
KJV	Mark	9	8	And suddenly , when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , save Jesus only with themselves .
KJV	Mark	9	10	And they kept that saying with themselves , questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean .
KJV	Mark	9	11	And they asked him , saying , Why say the scribes that Elias must first come ?
KJV	Mark	9	12	And he answered and told them , Elias verily cometh first , and restoreth all things ; and how it is written of the Son of man , that he must suffer many things , and be set at nought .
KJV	Mark	9	13	But I say unto you , That Elias is indeed come , and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed , as it is written of him .
KJV	Mark	9	14	And when he came to his disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and the scribes questioning with them .
KJV	Mark	9	15	And straightway all the people , when they beheld him , were greatly amazed , and running to him saluted him .
KJV	Mark	9	16	And he asked the scribes , What question ye with them ?
KJV	Mark	9	17	And one of the multitude answered and said , Master , I have brought unto thee my son , which hath a dumb spirit ;
KJV	Mark	9	18	And wheresoever he taketh him , he teareth him : and he foameth , and gnasheth with his teeth , and pineth away : and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out ; and they could not .
KJV	Mark	9	19	He answereth him , and saith , O faithless generation , how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I suffer you ? bring him unto me .
KJV	Mark	9	20	And they brought him unto him : and when he saw him , straightway the spirit tare him ; and he fell on the ground , and wallowed foaming .
KJV	Mark	9	21	And he asked his father , How long is it ago since this came unto him ? And he said , Of a child .
KJV	Mark	9	22	And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire , and into the waters , to destroy him : but if thou canst do any thing , have compassion on us , and help us .
KJV	Mark	9	23	Jesus said unto him , If thou canst believe , all things are possible to him that believeth .
KJV	Mark	9	24	And straightway the father of the child cried out , and said with tears , Lord , I believe ; help thou mine unbelief .
KJV	Mark	9	25	When Jesus saw that the people came running together , he rebuked the foul spirit , saying unto him , Thou dumb and deaf spirit , I charge thee , come out of him , and enter no more into him .
KJV	Mark	9	26	And the spirit cried , and rent him sore , and came out of him : and he was as one dead ; insomuch that many said , He is dead .
KJV	Mark	9	27	But Jesus took him by the hand , and lifted him up ; and he arose .
KJV	Mark	9	28	And when he was come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , Why could not we cast him out ?
KJV	Mark	9	29	And he said unto them , This kind can come forth by nothing , but by prayer and fasting .
KJV	Mark	9	30	And they departed thence , and passed through Galilee ; and he would not that any man should know it .
KJV	Mark	9	31	For he taught his disciples , and said unto them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
KJV	Mark	9	32	But they understood not that saying , and were afraid to ask him .
KJV	Mark	9	33	And he came to Capernaum : and being in the house he asked them , What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way ?
KJV	Mark	9	34	But they held their peace : for by the way they had disputed among themselves , who should be the greatest .
KJV	Mark	9	35	And he sat down , and called the twelve , and saith unto them , If any man desire to be first , the same shall be last of all , and servant of all .
KJV	Mark	9	36	And he took a child , and set him in the midst of them : and when he had taken him in his arms , he said unto them ,
KJV	Mark	9	37	Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name , receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me , receiveth not me , but him that sent me .
KJV	Mark	9	38	And John answered him , saying , Master , we saw one casting out devils in thy name , and he followeth not us : and we forbad him , because he followeth not us .
KJV	Mark	9	39	But Jesus said , Forbid him not : for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name , that can lightly speak evil of me .
KJV	Mark	9	40	For he that is not against us is on our part .
KJV	Mark	9	41	For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to Christ , verily I say unto you , he shall not lose his reward .
KJV	Mark	9	42	And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me , it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea .
KJV	Mark	9	43	And if thy hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
KJV	Mark	9	44	Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
KJV	Mark	9	45	And if thy foot offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter halt into life , than having two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
KJV	Mark	9	46	Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
KJV	Mark	9	47	And if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire :
KJV	Mark	9	48	Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
KJV	Mark	9	49	For every one shall be salted with fire , and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt .
KJV	Mark	9	50	Salt is good : but if the salt have lost his saltness , wherewith will ye season it ? Have salt in yourselves , and have peace one with another .
KJV	Mark	10	10	And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter .
KJV	Mark	10	2	And the Pharisees came to him , and asked him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? tempting him .
KJV	Mark	10	3	And he answered and said unto them , What did Moses command you ?
KJV	Mark	10	4	And they said , Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement , and to put her away .
KJV	Mark	10	5	And Jesus answered and said unto them , For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept .
KJV	Mark	10	6	But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female .
KJV	Mark	10	7	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and cleave to his wife ;
KJV	Mark	10	8	And they twain shall be one flesh : so then they are no more twain , but one flesh .
KJV	Mark	10	9	What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
KJV	Mark	10	11	And he saith unto them , Whosoever shall put away his wife , and marry another , committeth adultery against her .
KJV	Mark	10	12	And if a woman shall put away her husband , and be married to another , she committeth adultery .
KJV	Mark	10	13	And they brought young children to him , that he should touch them : and his disciples rebuked those that brought them .
KJV	Mark	10	14	But when Jesus saw it , he was much displeased , and said unto them , Suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God .
KJV	Mark	10	15	Verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , he shall not enter therein .
KJV	Mark	10	16	And he took them up in his arms , put his hands upon them , and blessed them .
KJV	Mark	10	17	And when he was gone forth into the way , there came one running , and kneeled to him , and asked him , Good Master , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ?
KJV	Mark	10	18	And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , that is , God .
KJV	Mark	10	19	Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Defraud not , Honour thy father and mother .
KJV	Mark	10	20	And he answered and said unto him , Master , all these have I observed from my youth .
KJV	Mark	10	21	Then Jesus beholding him loved him , and said unto him , One thing thou lackest : go thy way , sell whatsoever thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , take up the cross , and follow me .
KJV	Mark	10	22	And he was sad at that saying , and went away grieved : for he had great possessions .
KJV	Mark	10	23	And Jesus looked round about , and saith unto his disciples , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
KJV	Mark	10	24	And the disciples were astonished at his words . But Jesus answereth again , and saith unto them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God !
KJV	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
KJV	Mark	10	26	And they were astonished out of measure , saying among themselves , Who then can be saved ?
KJV	Mark	10	27	And Jesus looking upon them saith , With men it is impossible , but not with God : for with God all things are possible .
KJV	Mark	10	28	Then Peter began to say unto him , Lo , we have left all , and have followed thee .
KJV	Mark	10	29	And Jesus answered and said , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my sake , and the gospel 's ,
KJV	Mark	10	30	But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time , houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions ; and in the world to come eternal life .
KJV	Mark	10	31	But many that are first shall be last ; and the last first .
KJV	Mark	10	32	And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem ; and Jesus went before them : and they were amazed ; and as they followed , they were afraid . And he took again the twelve , and began to tell them what things should happen unto him ,
KJV	Mark	10	33	Saying , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests , and unto the scribes ; and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the Gentiles :
KJV	Mark	10	34	And they shall mock him , and shall scourge him , and shall spit upon him , and shall kill him : and the third day he shall rise again .
KJV	Mark	10	35	And James and John , the sons of Zebedee , come unto him , saying , Master , we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire .
KJV	Mark	10	36	And he said unto them , What would ye that I should do for you ?
KJV	Mark	10	37	They said unto him , Grant unto us that we may sit , one on thy right hand , and the other on thy left hand , in thy glory .
KJV	Mark	10	38	But Jesus said unto them , Ye know not what ye ask : can ye drink of the cup that I drink of ? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ?
KJV	Mark	10	39	And they said unto him , We can . And Jesus said unto them , Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of ; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized :
KJV	Mark	10	40	But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared .
KJV	Mark	10	41	And when the ten heard it , they began to be much displeased with James and John .
KJV	Mark	10	42	But Jesus called them to him , and saith unto them , Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them .
KJV	Mark	10	43	But so shall it not be among you : but whosoever will be great among you , shall be your minister :
KJV	Mark	10	44	And whosoever of you will be the chiefest , shall be servant of all .
KJV	Mark	10	45	For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
KJV	Mark	10	46	And they came to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people , blind Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , sat by the highway side begging .
KJV	Mark	10	47	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out , and say , Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me .
KJV	Mark	10	48	And many charged him that he should hold his peace : but he cried the more a great deal , Thou son of David , have mercy on me .
KJV	Mark	10	49	And Jesus stood still , and commanded him to be called . And they call the blind man , saying unto him , Be of good comfort , rise ; he calleth thee .
KJV	Mark	10	50	And he , casting away his garment , rose , and came to Jesus .
KJV	Mark	10	51	And Jesus answered and said unto him , What wilt thou that I should do unto thee ? The blind man said unto him , Lord , that I might receive my sight .
KJV	Mark	10	52	And Jesus said unto him , Go thy way ; thy faith hath made thee whole . And immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way .
KJV	Mark	11	11	And Jesus entered into Jerusalem , and into the temple : and when he had looked round about upon all things , and now the eventide was come , he went out unto Bethany with the twelve .
KJV	Mark	11	2	And saith unto them , Go your way into the village over against you : and as soon as ye be entered into it , ye shall find a colt tied , whereon never man sat ; loose him , and bring him .
KJV	Mark	11	3	And if any man say unto you , Why do ye this ? say ye that the Lord hath need of him ; and straightway he will send him hither .
KJV	Mark	11	4	And they went their way , and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met ; and they loose him .
KJV	Mark	11	5	And certain of them that stood there said unto them , What do ye , loosing the colt ?
KJV	Mark	11	6	And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded : and they let them go .
KJV	Mark	11	7	And they brought the colt to Jesus , and cast their garments on him ; and he sat upon him .
KJV	Mark	11	8	And many spread their garments in the way : and others cut down branches off the trees , and strawed them in the way .
KJV	Mark	11	9	And they that went before , and they that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna ; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord :
KJV	Mark	11	10	Blessed be the kingdom of our father David , that cometh in the name of the Lord : Hosanna in the highest .
KJV	Mark	11	12	And on the morrow , when they were come from Bethany , he was hungry :
KJV	Mark	11	13	And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves , he came , if haply he might find any thing thereon : and when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves ; for the time of figs was not yet .
KJV	Mark	11	14	And Jesus answered and said unto it , No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever . And his disciples heard it .
KJV	Mark	11	15	And they come to Jerusalem : and Jesus went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ;
KJV	Mark	11	16	And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple .
KJV	Mark	11	17	And he taught , saying unto them , Is it not written , My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer ? but ye have made it a den of thieves .
KJV	Mark	11	18	And the scribes and chief priests heard it , and sought how they might destroy him : for they feared him , because all the people was astonished at his doctrine .
KJV	Mark	11	19	And when even was come , he went out of the city .
KJV	Mark	11	20	And in the morning , as they passed by , they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots .
KJV	Mark	11	21	And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him , Master , behold , the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away .
KJV	Mark	11	22	And Jesus answering saith unto them , Have faith in God .
KJV	Mark	11	23	For verily I say unto you , That whosoever shall say unto this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; and shall not doubt in his heart , but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass ; he shall have whatsoever he saith .
KJV	Mark	11	24	Therefore I say unto you , What things soever ye desire , when ye pray , believe that ye receive them , and ye shall have them .
KJV	Mark	11	25	And when ye stand praying , forgive , if ye have ought against any : that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses .
KJV	Mark	11	26	But if ye do not forgive , neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses .
KJV	Mark	11	27	And they come again to Jerusalem : and as he was walking in the temple , there come to him the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders ,
KJV	Mark	11	28	And say unto him , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority to do these things ?
KJV	Mark	11	29	And Jesus answered and said unto them , I will also ask of you one question , and answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
KJV	Mark	11	30	The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or of men ? answer me .
KJV	Mark	11	31	And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then did ye not believe him ?
KJV	Mark	11	32	But if we shall say , Of men ; they feared the people : for all men counted John , that he was a prophet indeed .
KJV	Mark	11	33	And they answered and said unto Jesus , We can not tell . And Jesus answering saith unto them , Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things .
KJV	Mark	12	12	And they sought to lay hold on him , but feared the people : for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them : and they left him , and went their way .
KJV	Mark	12	2	And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard .
KJV	Mark	12	3	And they caught him , and beat him , and sent him away empty .
KJV	Mark	12	4	And again he sent unto them another servant ; and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully handled .
KJV	Mark	12	5	And again he sent another ; and him they killed , and many others ; beating some , and killing some .
KJV	Mark	12	6	Having yet therefore one son , his wellbeloved , he sent him also last unto them , saying , They will reverence my son .
KJV	Mark	12	7	But those husbandmen said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be ours . '
KJV	Mark	12	8	And they took him , and killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard .
KJV	Mark	12	9	What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others .
KJV	Mark	12	10	And have ye not read this scripture ; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner :
KJV	Mark	12	11	This was the Lord 's doing , and it is marvellous in our eyes ?
KJV	Mark	12	13	And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians , to catch him in his words .
KJV	Mark	12	14	And when they were come , they say unto him , Master , we know that thou art true , and carest for no man : for thou regardest not the person of men , but teachest the way of God in truth : Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar , or not ?
KJV	Mark	12	15	Shall we give , or shall we not give ? But he , knowing their hypocrisy , said unto them , Why tempt ye me ? bring me a penny , that I may see it .
KJV	Mark	12	16	And they brought it . And he saith unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ? And they said unto him , Caesar 's .
KJV	Mark	12	17	And Jesus answering said unto them , Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar 's , and to God the things that are God 's . And they marvelled at him .
KJV	Mark	12	18	Then come unto him the Sadducees , which say there is no resurrection ; and they asked him , saying ,
KJV	Mark	12	19	Master , Moses wrote unto us , If a man 's brother die , and leave his wife behind him , and leave no children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
KJV	Mark	12	20	Now there were seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and dying left no seed .
KJV	Mark	12	21	And the second took her , and died , neither left he any seed : and the third likewise .
KJV	Mark	12	22	And the seven had her , and left no seed : last of all the woman died also .
KJV	Mark	12	23	In the resurrection therefore , when they shall rise , whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her to wife .
KJV	Mark	12	24	And Jesus answering said unto them , Do ye not therefore err , because ye know not the scriptures , neither the power of God ?
KJV	Mark	12	25	For when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as the angels which are in heaven .
KJV	Mark	12	26	And as touching the dead , that they rise : have ye not read in the book of Moses , how in the bush God spake unto him , saying , I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ?
KJV	Mark	12	27	He is not the God of the dead , but the God of the living : ye therefore do greatly err .
KJV	Mark	12	28	And one of the scribes came , and having heard them reasoning together , and perceiving that he had answered them well , asked him , Which is the first commandment of all ?
KJV	Mark	12	29	And Jesus answered him , The first of all the commandments is , Hear , O Israel ; The Lord our God is one Lord :
KJV	Mark	12	30	And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength : this is the first commandment .
KJV	Mark	12	31	And the second is like , namely this , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself . There is none other commandment greater than these .
KJV	Mark	12	32	And the scribe said unto him , Well , Master , thou hast said the truth : for there is one God ; and there is none other but he :
KJV	Mark	12	33	And to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbour as himself , is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices .
KJV	Mark	12	34	And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly , he said unto him , Thou art not far from the kingdom of God . And no man after that durst ask him any question .
KJV	Mark	12	35	And Jesus answered and said , while he taught in the temple , How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David ?
KJV	Mark	12	36	For David himself said by the Holy Ghost , The Lord said to my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool .
KJV	Mark	12	37	David therefore himself calleth him Lord ; and whence is he then his son ? And the common people heard him gladly .
KJV	Mark	12	38	And he said unto them in his doctrine , Beware of the scribes , which love to go in long clothing , and love salutations in the marketplaces ,
KJV	Mark	12	39	And the chief seats in the synagogues , and the uppermost rooms at feasts :
KJV	Mark	12	40	Which devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayers : these shall receive greater damnation .
KJV	Mark	12	41	And Jesus sat over against the treasury , and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury : and many that were rich cast in much .
KJV	Mark	12	42	And there came a certain poor widow , and she threw in two mites , which make a farthing .
KJV	Mark	12	43	And he called unto him his disciples , and saith unto them , Verily I say unto you , That this poor widow hath cast more in , than all they which have cast into the treasury :
KJV	Mark	12	44	For all they did cast in of their abundance ; but she of her want did cast in all that she had , even all her living .
KJV	Mark	13	13	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake : but he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
KJV	Mark	13	2	And Jesus answering said unto him , Seest thou these great buildings ? there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
KJV	Mark	13	3	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple , Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately ,
KJV	Mark	13	4	Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled ?
KJV	Mark	13	5	And Jesus answering them began to say , Take heed lest any man deceive you :
KJV	Mark	13	6	For many shall come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and shall deceive many .
KJV	Mark	13	7	And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , be ye not troubled : for such things must needs be ; but the end shall not be yet .
KJV	Mark	13	8	For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be earthquakes in divers places , and there shall be famines and troubles : these are the beginnings of sorrows .
KJV	Mark	13	9	But take heed to yourselves : for they shall deliver you up to councils ; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten : and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them .
KJV	Mark	13	10	And the gospel must first be published among all nations .
KJV	Mark	13	11	But when they shall lead you , and deliver you up , take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak , neither do ye premeditate : but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ye : for it is not ye that speak , but the Holy Ghost .
KJV	Mark	13	12	Now the brother shall betray the brother to death , and the father the son ; and children shall rise up against their parents , and shall cause them to be put to death .
KJV	Mark	13	14	But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not , ( let him that readeth understand , ) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains :
KJV	Mark	13	15	And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house , neither enter therein , to take any thing out of his house :
KJV	Mark	13	16	And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment .
KJV	Mark	13	17	But woe to them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
KJV	Mark	13	18	And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter .
KJV	Mark	13	19	For in those days shall be affliction , such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time , neither shall be .
KJV	Mark	13	20	And except that the Lord had shortened those days , no flesh should be saved : but for the elect 's sake , whom he hath chosen , he hath shortened the days .
KJV	Mark	13	21	And then if any man shall say to you , Lo , here is Christ ; or , lo , he is there ; believe him not :
KJV	Mark	13	22	For false Christs and false prophets shall rise , and shall shew signs and wonders , to seduce , if it were possible , even the elect .
KJV	Mark	13	23	But take ye heed : behold , I have foretold you all things .
KJV	Mark	13	24	But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light ,
KJV	Mark	13	25	And the stars of heaven shall fall , and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken .
KJV	Mark	13	26	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory .
KJV	Mark	13	27	And then shall he send his angels , and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven .
KJV	Mark	13	28	Now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When her branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is near :
KJV	Mark	13	29	So ye in like manner , when ye shall see these things come to pass , know that it is nigh , even at the doors .
KJV	Mark	13	30	Verily I say unto you , that this generation shall not pass , till all these things be done .
KJV	Mark	13	31	Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
KJV	Mark	13	32	But of that day and that hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels which are in heaven , neither the Son , but the Father .
KJV	Mark	13	33	Take ye heed , watch and pray : for ye know not when the time is .
KJV	Mark	13	34	For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey , who left his house , and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and commanded the porter to watch .
KJV	Mark	13	35	Watch ye therefore : for ye know not when the master of the house cometh , at even , or at midnight , or at the cockcrowing , or in the morning :
KJV	Mark	13	36	Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping .
KJV	Mark	13	37	And what I say unto you I say unto all , Watch .
KJV	Mark	14	14	And wheresoever he shall go in , say ye to the goodman of the house , The Master saith , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
KJV	Mark	14	2	But they said , Not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar of the people .
KJV	Mark	14	3	And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at meat , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious ; and she brake the box , and poured it on his head .
KJV	Mark	14	4	And there were some that had indignation within themselves , and said , Why was this waste of the ointment made ?
KJV	Mark	14	5	For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence , and have been given to the poor . And they murmured against her .
KJV	Mark	14	6	And Jesus said , Let her alone ; why trouble ye her ? she hath wrought a good work on me .
KJV	Mark	14	7	For ye have the poor with you always , and whensoever ye will ye may do them good : but me ye have not always .
KJV	Mark	14	8	She hath done what she could : she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying .
KJV	Mark	14	9	Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world , this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her .
KJV	Mark	14	10	And Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , went unto the chief priests , to betray him unto them .
KJV	Mark	14	11	And when they heard it , they were glad , and promised to give him money . And he sought how he might conveniently betray him .
KJV	Mark	14	12	And the first day of unleavened bread , when they killed the passover , his disciples said unto him , Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover ?
KJV	Mark	14	13	And he sendeth forth two of his disciples , and saith unto them , Go ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him .
KJV	Mark	14	15	And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared : there make ready for us .
KJV	Mark	14	16	And his disciples went forth , and came into the city , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
KJV	Mark	14	17	And in the evening he cometh with the twelve .
KJV	Mark	14	18	And as they sat and did eat , Jesus said , Verily I say unto you , One of you which eateth with me shall betray me .
KJV	Mark	14	19	And they began to be sorrowful , and to say unto him one by one , Is it I ? and another said , Is it I ?
KJV	Mark	14	20	And he answered and said unto them , It is one of the twelve , that dippeth with me in the dish .
KJV	Mark	14	21	The Son of man indeed goeth , as it is written of him : but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born .
KJV	Mark	14	22	And as they did eat , Jesus took bread , and blessed , and brake it , and gave to them , and said , Take , eat : this is my body .
KJV	Mark	14	23	And he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them : and they all drank of it .
KJV	Mark	14	24	And he said unto them , This is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many .
KJV	Mark	14	25	Verily I say unto you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God .
KJV	Mark	14	26	And when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of Olives .
KJV	Mark	14	27	And Jesus saith unto them , All ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered .
KJV	Mark	14	28	But after that I am risen , I will go before you into Galilee .
KJV	Mark	14	29	But Peter said unto him , Although all shall be offended , yet will not I .
KJV	Mark	14	30	And Jesus saith unto him , Verily I say unto thee , That this day , even in this night , before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice .
KJV	Mark	14	31	But he spake the more vehemently , If I should die with thee , I will not deny thee in any wise . Likewise also said they all .
KJV	Mark	14	32	And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane : and he saith to his disciples , Sit ye here , while I shall pray .
KJV	Mark	14	33	And he taketh with him Peter and James and John , and began to be sore amazed , and to be very heavy ;
KJV	Mark	14	34	And saith unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death : tarry ye here , and watch .
KJV	Mark	14	35	And he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass from him .
KJV	Mark	14	36	And he said , Abba , Father , all things are possible unto thee ; take away this cup from me : nevertheless not what I will , but what thou wilt .
KJV	Mark	14	37	And he cometh , and findeth them sleeping , and saith unto Peter , Simon , sleepest thou ? couldest not thou watch one hour ?
KJV	Mark	14	38	Watch ye and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . The spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is weak .
KJV	Mark	14	39	And again he went away , and prayed , and spake the same words .
KJV	Mark	14	40	And when he returned , he found them asleep again , ( for their eyes were heavy , ) neither wist they what to answer him .
KJV	Mark	14	41	And he cometh the third time , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : it is enough , the hour is come ; behold , the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
KJV	Mark	14	42	Rise up , let us go ; lo , he that betrayeth me is at hand .
KJV	Mark	14	43	And immediately , while he yet spake , cometh Judas , one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
KJV	Mark	14	44	And he that betrayed him had given them a token , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he ; take him , and lead him away safely .
KJV	Mark	14	45	And as soon as he was come , he goeth straightway to him , and saith , Master , master ; and kissed him .
KJV	Mark	14	46	And they laid their hands on him , and took him .
KJV	Mark	14	47	And one of them that stood by drew a sword , and smote a servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
KJV	Mark	14	48	And Jesus answered and said unto them , Are ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and with staves to take me ?
KJV	Mark	14	49	I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and ye took me not : but the scriptures must be fulfilled .
KJV	Mark	14	50	And they all forsook him , and fled .
KJV	Mark	14	51	And there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
KJV	Mark	14	52	And he left the linen cloth , and fled from them naked .
KJV	Mark	14	53	And they led Jesus away to the high priest : and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes .
KJV	Mark	14	54	And Peter followed him afar off , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire .
KJV	Mark	14	55	And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death ; and found none .
KJV	Mark	14	56	For many bare false witness against him , but their witness agreed not together .
KJV	Mark	14	57	And there arose certain , and bare false witness against him , saying ,
KJV	Mark	14	58	We heard him say , I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and within three days I will build another made without hands .
KJV	Mark	14	59	But neither so did their witness agree together .
KJV	Mark	14	60	And the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
KJV	Mark	14	61	But he held his peace , and answered nothing . Again the high priest asked him , and said unto him , Art thou the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ?
KJV	Mark	14	62	And Jesus said , I am : and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven .
KJV	Mark	14	63	Then the high priest rent his clothes , and saith , What need we any further witnesses ?
KJV	Mark	14	64	Ye have heard the blasphemy : what think ye ? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death .
KJV	Mark	14	65	And some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say unto him , Prophesy : and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands .
KJV	Mark	14	66	And as Peter was beneath in the palace , there cometh one of the maids of the high priest :
KJV	Mark	14	67	And when she saw Peter warming himself , she looked upon him , and said , And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth .
KJV	Mark	14	68	But he denied , saying , I know not , neither understand I what thou sayest . And he went out into the porch ; and the cock crew .
KJV	Mark	14	69	And a maid saw him again , and began to say to them that stood by , This is one of them .
KJV	Mark	14	70	And he denied it again . And a little after , they that stood by said again to Peter , Surely thou art one of them : for thou art a Galilaean , and thy speech agreeth thereto .
KJV	Mark	14	71	But he began to curse and to swear , saying , I know not this man of whom ye speak .
KJV	Mark	14	72	And the second time the cock crew . And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him , Before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . And when he thought thereon , he wept .
KJV	Mark	15	15	And so Pilate , willing to content the people , released Barabbas unto them , and delivered Jesus , when he had scourged him , to be crucified .
KJV	Mark	15	2	And Pilate asked him , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answering said unto them , Thou sayest it .
KJV	Mark	15	3	And the chief priests accused him of many things : but he answered nothing .
KJV	Mark	15	4	And Pilate asked him again , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? behold how many things they witness against thee .
KJV	Mark	15	5	But Jesus yet answered nothing ; so that Pilate marvelled .
KJV	Mark	15	6	Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner , whomsoever they desired .
KJV	Mark	15	7	And there was one named Barabbas , which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him , who had committed murder in the insurrection .
KJV	Mark	15	8	And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them .
KJV	Mark	15	9	But Pilate answered them , saying , Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
KJV	Mark	15	10	For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy .
KJV	Mark	15	11	But the chief priests moved the people , that he should rather release Barabbas unto them .
KJV	Mark	15	12	And Pilate answered and said again unto them , What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews ?
KJV	Mark	15	13	And they cried out again , Crucify him .
KJV	Mark	15	14	Then Pilate said unto them , Why , what evil hath he done ? And they cried out the more exceedingly , Crucify him .
KJV	Mark	15	16	And the soldiers led him away into the hall , called Praetorium ; and they call together the whole band .
KJV	Mark	15	17	And they clothed him with purple , and platted a crown of thorns , and put it about his head ,
KJV	Mark	15	18	And began to salute him , Hail , King of the Jews !
KJV	Mark	15	19	And they smote him on the head with a reed , and did spit upon him , and bowing their knees worshipped him .
KJV	Mark	15	20	And when they had mocked him , they took off the purple from him , and put his own clothes on him , and led him out to crucify him .
KJV	Mark	15	21	And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian , who passed by , coming out of the country , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to bear his cross .
KJV	Mark	15	22	And they bring him unto the place Golgotha , which is , being interpreted , The place of a skull .
KJV	Mark	15	23	And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh : but he received it not .
KJV	Mark	15	24	And when they had crucified him , they parted his garments , casting lots upon them , what every man should take .
KJV	Mark	15	25	And it was the third hour , and they crucified him .
KJV	Mark	15	26	And the superscription of his accusation was written over , The King Of The Jews .
KJV	Mark	15	27	And with him they crucify two thieves ; the one on his right hand , and the other on his left .
KJV	Mark	15	28	And the scripture was fulfilled , which saith , And he was numbered with the transgressors .
KJV	Mark	15	29	And they that passed by railed on him , wagging their heads , and saying , Ah , thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days ,
KJV	Mark	15	30	Save thyself , and come down from the cross .
KJV	Mark	15	31	Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes , He saved others ; himself he can not save .
KJV	Mark	15	32	Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross , that we may see and believe . And they that were crucified with him reviled him .
KJV	Mark	15	33	And when the sixth hour was come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
KJV	Mark	15	34	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? which is , being interpreted , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ?
KJV	Mark	15	35	And some of them that stood by , when they heard it , said , Behold , he calleth Elias .
KJV	Mark	15	36	And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let alone ; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down .
KJV	Mark	15	37	And Jesus cried with a loud voice , and gave up the ghost .
KJV	Mark	15	38	And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom .
KJV	Mark	15	39	And when the centurion , which stood over against him , saw that he so cried out , and gave up the ghost , he said , Truly this man was the Son of God .
KJV	Mark	15	40	There were also women looking on afar off : among whom was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses , and Salome ;
KJV	Mark	15	41	( Who also , when he was in Galilee , followed him , and ministered unto him ; ) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem .
KJV	Mark	15	42	And now when the even was come , because it was the preparation , that is , the day before the sabbath ,
KJV	Mark	15	43	Joseph of Arimathaea , an honourable counsellor , which also waited for the kingdom of God , came , and went in boldly unto Pilate , and craved the body of Jesus .
KJV	Mark	15	44	And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead : and calling unto him the centurion , he asked him whether he had been any while dead .
KJV	Mark	15	45	And when he knew it of the centurion , he gave the body to Joseph .
KJV	Mark	15	46	And he bought fine linen , and took him down , and wrapped him in the linen , and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock , and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre .
KJV	Mark	15	47	And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid .
KJV	Mark	16	16	He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved ; but he that believeth not shall be damned .
KJV	Mark	16	2	And very early in the morning the first day of the week , they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun .
KJV	Mark	16	3	And they said among themselves , Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre ?
KJV	Mark	16	4	And when they looked , they saw that the stone was rolled away : for it was very great .
KJV	Mark	16	5	And entering into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clothed in a long white garment ; and they were affrighted .
KJV	Mark	16	6	And he saith unto them , Be not affrighted : Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth , which was crucified : he is risen ; he is not here : behold the place where they laid him .
KJV	Mark	16	7	But go your way , tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee : there shall ye see him , as he said unto you .
KJV	Mark	16	8	And they went out quickly , and fled from the sepulchre ; for they trembled and were amazed : neither said they any thing to any man ; for they were afraid .
KJV	Mark	16	9	Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , out of whom he had cast seven devils .
KJV	Mark	16	10	And she went and told them that had been with him , as they mourned and wept .
KJV	Mark	16	11	And they , when they had heard that he was alive , and had been seen of her , believed not .
KJV	Mark	16	12	After that he appeared in another form unto two of them , as they walked , and went into the country .
KJV	Mark	16	13	And they went and told it unto the residue : neither believed they them .
KJV	Mark	16	14	Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat , and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen .
KJV	Mark	16	15	And he said unto them , Go ye into all the world , and preach the gospel to every creature .
KJV	Mark	16	17	And these signs shall follow them that believe ; In my name shall they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ;
KJV	Mark	16	18	They shall take up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover .
KJV	Mark	16	19	So then after the Lord had spoken unto them , he was received up into heaven , and sat on the right hand of God .
KJV	Mark	16	20	And they went forth , and preached every where , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word with signs following . Amen .
KJV	Luke	1	1	Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us ,
KJV	Luke	1	2	Even as they delivered them unto us , which from the beginning were eyewitnesses , and ministers of the word ;
KJV	Luke	1	3	It seemed good to me also , having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first , to write unto thee in order , most excellent Theophilus ,
KJV	Luke	1	4	That thou mightest know the certainty of those things , wherein thou hast been instructed .
KJV	Luke	1	5	There was in the days of Herod , the king of Judaea , a certain priest named Zacharias , of the course of Abia : and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elisabeth .
KJV	Luke	1	6	And they were both righteous before God , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless .
KJV	Luke	1	7	And they had no child , because that Elisabeth was barren , and they both were now well stricken in years .
KJV	Luke	1	8	And it came to pass , that while he executed the priest 's office before God in the order of his course ,
KJV	Luke	1	9	According to the custom of the priest 's office , his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord .
KJV	Luke	1	10	And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense .
KJV	Luke	1	11	And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
KJV	Luke	1	12	And when Zacharias saw him , he was troubled , and fear fell upon him .
KJV	Luke	1	13	But the angel said unto him , Fear not , Zacharias : for thy prayer is heard ; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John .
KJV	Luke	1	14	And thou shalt have joy and gladness ; and many shall rejoice at his birth .
KJV	Luke	1	15	For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord , and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink ; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost , even from his mother 's womb .
KJV	Luke	1	16	And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God .
KJV	Luke	1	17	And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias , to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just ; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord .
KJV	Luke	1	18	And Zacharias said unto the angel , Whereby shall I know this ? for I am an old man , and my wife well stricken in years .
KJV	Luke	1	19	And the angel answering said unto him , I am Gabriel , that stand in the presence of God ; and am sent to speak unto thee , and to shew thee these glad tidings .
KJV	Luke	1	20	And , behold , thou shalt be dumb , and not able to speak , until the day that these things shall be performed , because thou believest not my words , which shall be fulfilled in their season .
KJV	Luke	1	21	And the people waited for Zacharias , and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple .
KJV	Luke	1	22	And when he came out , he could not speak unto them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple : for he beckoned unto them , and remained speechless .
KJV	Luke	1	23	And it came to pass , that , as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished , he departed to his own house .
KJV	Luke	1	24	And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived , and hid herself five months , saying ,
KJV	Luke	1	25	Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me , to take away my reproach among men .
KJV	Luke	1	26	And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee , named Nazareth ,
KJV	Luke	1	27	To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin 's name was Mary .
KJV	Luke	1	28	And the angel came in unto her , and said , Hail , thou that art highly favoured , the Lord is with thee : blessed art thou among women .
KJV	Luke	1	29	And when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying , and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be .
KJV	Luke	1	30	And the angel said unto her , Fear not , Mary : for thou hast found favour with God .
KJV	Luke	1	31	And , behold , thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name Jesus .
KJV	Luke	1	32	He shall be great , and shall be called the Son of the Highest : and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David :
KJV	Luke	1	33	And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end .
KJV	Luke	1	34	Then said Mary unto the angel , How shall this be , seeing I know not a man ?
KJV	Luke	1	35	And the angel answered and said unto her , The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee , and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee : therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God .
KJV	Luke	1	36	And , behold , thy cousin Elisabeth , she hath also conceived a son in her old age : and this is the sixth month with her , who was called barren .
KJV	Luke	1	37	For with God nothing shall be impossible .
KJV	Luke	1	38	And Mary said , Behold the handmaid of the Lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . And the angel departed from her .
KJV	Luke	1	39	And Mary arose in those days , and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of Juda ;
KJV	Luke	1	40	And entered into the house of Zacharias , and saluted Elisabeth .
KJV	Luke	1	41	And it came to pass , that , when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary , the babe leaped in her womb ; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost :
KJV	Luke	1	42	And she spake out with a loud voice , and said , Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb .
KJV	Luke	1	43	And whence is this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
KJV	Luke	1	44	For , lo , as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy .
KJV	Luke	1	45	And blessed is she that believed : for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord .
KJV	Luke	1	46	And Mary said , My soul doth magnify the Lord ,
KJV	Luke	1	47	And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour .
KJV	Luke	1	48	For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden : for , behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed .
KJV	Luke	1	49	For he that is mighty hath done to me great things ; and holy is his name .
KJV	Luke	1	50	And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation .
KJV	Luke	1	51	He hath shewed strength with his arm ; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts .
KJV	Luke	1	52	He hath put down the mighty from their seats , and exalted them of low degree .
KJV	Luke	1	53	He hath filled the hungry with good things ; and the rich he hath sent empty away .
KJV	Luke	1	54	He hath helped his servant Israel , in remembrance of his mercy ;
KJV	Luke	1	55	As he spake to our fathers , to Abraham , and to his seed for ever .
KJV	Luke	1	56	And Mary abode with her about three months , and returned to her own house .
KJV	Luke	1	57	Now Elisabeth 's full time came that she should be delivered ; and she brought forth a son .
KJV	Luke	1	58	And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her ; and they rejoiced with her .
KJV	Luke	1	59	And it came to pass , that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child ; and they called him Zacharias , after the name of his father .
KJV	Luke	1	60	And his mother answered and said , Not so ; but he shall be called John .
KJV	Luke	1	61	And they said unto her , There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name .
KJV	Luke	1	62	And they made signs to his father , how he would have him called .
KJV	Luke	1	63	And he asked for a writing table , and wrote , saying , His name is John . And they marvelled all .
KJV	Luke	1	64	And his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue loosed , and he spake , and praised God .
KJV	Luke	1	65	And fear came on all that dwelt round about them : and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea .
KJV	Luke	1	66	And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , What manner of child shall this be ! And the hand of the Lord was with him .
KJV	Luke	1	67	And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost , and prophesied , saying ,
KJV	Luke	1	68	Blessed be the Lord God of Israel ; for he hath visited and redeemed his people ,
KJV	Luke	1	69	And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David ;
KJV	Luke	1	70	As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets , which have been since the world began :
KJV	Luke	1	71	That we should be saved from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ;
KJV	Luke	1	72	To perform the mercy promised to our fathers , and to remember his holy covenant ;
KJV	Luke	1	73	The oath which he sware to our father Abraham ,
KJV	Luke	1	74	That he would grant unto us , that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear ,
KJV	Luke	1	75	In holiness and righteousness before him , all the days of our life .
KJV	Luke	1	76	And thou , child , shalt be called the prophet of the Highest : for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways ;
KJV	Luke	1	77	To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins ,
KJV	Luke	1	78	Through the tender mercy of our God ; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us ,
KJV	Luke	1	79	To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , to guide our feet into the way of peace .
KJV	Luke	1	80	And the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel .
KJV	Luke	2	2	( And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria . )
KJV	Luke	2	3	And all went to be taxed , every one into his own city .
KJV	Luke	2	4	And Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judaea , unto the city of David , which is called Bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and lineage of David : )
KJV	Luke	2	5	To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife , being great with child .
KJV	Luke	2	6	And so it was , that , while they were there , the days were accomplished that she should be delivered .
KJV	Luke	2	7	And she brought forth her firstborn son , and wrapped him in swaddling clothes , and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn .
KJV	Luke	2	8	And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night .
KJV	Luke	2	9	And , lo , the angel of the Lord came upon them , and the glory of the Lord shone round about them : and they were sore afraid .
KJV	Luke	2	10	And the angel said unto them , Fear not : for , behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people .
KJV	Luke	2	11	For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour , which is Christ the Lord .
KJV	Luke	2	12	And this shall be a sign unto you ; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes , lying in a manger .
KJV	Luke	2	13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God , and saying ,
KJV	Luke	2	14	Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace , good will toward men .
KJV	Luke	2	15	And it came to pass , as the angels were gone away from them into heaven , the shepherds said one to another , Let us now go even unto Bethlehem , and see this thing which is come to pass , which the Lord hath made known unto us .
KJV	Luke	2	16	And they came with haste , and found Mary , and Joseph , and the babe lying in a manger .
KJV	Luke	2	17	And when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
KJV	Luke	2	18	And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds .
KJV	Luke	2	19	But Mary kept all these things , and pondered them in her heart .
KJV	Luke	2	20	And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , as it was told unto them .
KJV	Luke	2	21	And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child , his name was called Jesus , which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
KJV	Luke	2	22	And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished , they brought him to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord ;
KJV	Luke	2	23	( As it is written in the law of the Lord , Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ; )
KJV	Luke	2	24	And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord , A pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons .
KJV	Luke	2	25	And , behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy Ghost was upon him .
KJV	Luke	2	26	And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord 's Christ .
KJV	Luke	2	27	And he came by the Spirit into the temple : and when the parents brought in the child Jesus , to do for him after the custom of the law ,
KJV	Luke	2	28	Then took he him up in his arms , and blessed God , and said ,
KJV	Luke	2	29	Lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace , according to thy word :
KJV	Luke	2	30	For mine eyes have seen thy salvation ,
KJV	Luke	2	31	Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people ;
KJV	Luke	2	32	A light to lighten the Gentiles , and the glory of thy people Israel .
KJV	Luke	2	33	And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him .
KJV	Luke	2	34	And Simeon blessed them , and said unto Mary his mother , Behold , this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel ; and for a sign which shall be spoken against ;
KJV	Luke	2	35	( Yea , a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also , ) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed .
KJV	Luke	2	36	And there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Aser : she was of a great age , and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity ;
KJV	Luke	2	37	And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years , which departed not from the temple , but served God with fastings and prayers night and day .
KJV	Luke	2	38	And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord , and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem .
KJV	Luke	2	39	And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own city Nazareth .
KJV	Luke	2	40	And the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , filled with wisdom : and the grace of God was upon him .
KJV	Luke	2	41	Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover .
KJV	Luke	2	42	And when he was twelve years old , they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast .
KJV	Luke	2	43	And when they had fulfilled the days , as they returned , the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem ; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it .
KJV	Luke	2	44	But they , supposing him to have been in the company , went a day 's journey ; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance .
KJV	Luke	2	45	And when they found him not , they turned back again to Jerusalem , seeking him .
KJV	Luke	2	46	And it came to pass , that after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the doctors , both hearing them , and asking them questions .
KJV	Luke	2	47	And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers .
KJV	Luke	2	48	And when they saw him , they were amazed : and his mother said unto him , Son , why hast thou thus dealt with us ? behold , thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing .
KJV	Luke	2	49	And he said unto them , How is it that ye sought me ? wist ye not that I must be about my Father 's business ?
KJV	Luke	2	50	And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them .
KJV	Luke	2	51	And he went down with them , and came to Nazareth , and was subject unto them : but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
KJV	Luke	2	52	And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature , and in favour with God and man .
KJV	Luke	3	3	And he came into all the country about Jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins ;
KJV	Luke	3	2	Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests , the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness .
KJV	Luke	3	4	As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet , saying , The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight .
KJV	Luke	3	5	Every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough ways shall be made smooth ;
KJV	Luke	3	6	And all flesh shall see the salvation of God .
KJV	Luke	3	7	Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
KJV	Luke	3	8	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
KJV	Luke	3	9	And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
KJV	Luke	3	10	And the people asked him , saying , What shall we do then ?
KJV	Luke	3	11	He answereth and saith unto them , He that hath two coats , let him impart to him that hath none ; and he that hath meat , let him do likewise .
KJV	Luke	3	12	Then came also publicans to be baptized , and said unto him , Master , what shall we do ?
KJV	Luke	3	13	And he said unto them , Exact no more than that which is appointed you .
KJV	Luke	3	14	And the soldiers likewise demanded of him , saying , And what shall we do ? And he said unto them , Do violence to no man , neither accuse any falsely ; and be content with your wages .
KJV	Luke	3	15	And as the people were in expectation , and all men mused in their hearts of John , whether he were the Christ , or not ;
KJV	Luke	3	16	John answered , saying unto them all , I indeed baptize you with water ; but one mightier than I cometh , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose : he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire :
KJV	Luke	3	17	Whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and will gather the wheat into his garner ; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable .
KJV	Luke	3	18	And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people .
KJV	Luke	3	19	But Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip 's wife , and for all the evils which Herod had done ,
KJV	Luke	3	20	Added yet this above all , that he shut up John in prison .
KJV	Luke	3	21	Now when all the people were baptized , it came to pass , that Jesus also being baptized , and praying , the heaven was opened ,
KJV	Luke	3	22	And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him , and a voice came from heaven , which said , Thou art my beloved Son ; in thee I am well pleased .
KJV	Luke	3	23	And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , which was the son of Heli ,
KJV	Luke	3	24	Which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi , which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Janna , which was the son of Joseph ,
KJV	Luke	3	25	Which was the son of Mattathias , which was the son of Amos , which was the son of Naum , which was the son of Esli , which was the son of Nagge ,
KJV	Luke	3	26	Which was the son of Maath , which was the son of Mattathias , which was the son of Semei , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Juda ,
KJV	Luke	3	27	Which was the son of Joanna , which was the son of Rhesa , which was the son of Zorobabel , which was the son of Salathiel , which was the son of Neri ,
KJV	Luke	3	28	Which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Addi , which was the son of Cosam , which was the son of Elmodam , which was the son of Er ,
KJV	Luke	3	29	Which was the son of Jose , which was the son of Eliezer , which was the son of Jorim , which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi ,
KJV	Luke	3	30	Which was the son of Simeon , which was the son of Juda , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Jonan , which was the son of Eliakim ,
KJV	Luke	3	31	Which was the son of Melea , which was the son of Menan , which was the son of Mattatha , which was the son of Nathan , which was the son of David ,
KJV	Luke	3	32	Which was the son of Jesse , which was the son of Obed , which was the son of Booz , which was the son of Salmon , which was the son of Naasson ,
KJV	Luke	3	33	Which was the son of Aminadab , which was the son of Aram , which was the son of Esrom , which was the son of Phares , which was the son of Juda ,
KJV	Luke	3	34	Which was the son of Jacob , which was the son of Isaac , which was the son of Abraham , which was the son of Thara , which was the son of Nachor ,
KJV	Luke	3	35	Which was the son of Saruch , which was the son of Ragau , which was the son of Phalec , which was the son of Heber , which was the son of Sala ,
KJV	Luke	3	36	Which was the son of Cainan , which was the son of Arphaxad , which was the son of Sem , which was the son of Noe , which was the son of Lamech ,
KJV	Luke	3	37	Which was the son of Mathusala , which was the son of Enoch , which was the son of Jared , which was the son of Maleleel , which was the son of Cainan ,
KJV	Luke	3	38	Which was the son of Enos , which was the son of Seth , which was the son of Adam , which was the son of God .
KJV	Luke	4	4	And Jesus answered him , saying , It is written , That man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God .
KJV	Luke	4	2	Being forty days tempted of the devil . And in those days he did eat nothing : and when they were ended , he afterward hungered .
KJV	Luke	4	3	And the devil said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , command this stone that it be made bread .
KJV	Luke	4	5	And the devil , taking him up into an high mountain , shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
KJV	Luke	4	6	And the devil said unto him , All this power will I give thee , and the glory of them : for that is delivered unto me ; and to whomsoever I will I give it .
KJV	Luke	4	7	If thou therefore wilt worship me , all shall be thine .
KJV	Luke	4	8	And Jesus answered and said unto him , Get thee behind me , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
KJV	Luke	4	9	And he brought him to Jerusalem , and set him on a pinnacle of the temple , and said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , cast thyself down from hence :
KJV	Luke	4	10	For it is written , He shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee :
KJV	Luke	4	11	And in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone .
KJV	Luke	4	12	And Jesus answering said unto him , It is said , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
KJV	Luke	4	13	And when the devil had ended all the temptation , he departed from him for a season .
KJV	Luke	4	14	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about .
KJV	Luke	4	15	And he taught in their synagogues , being glorified of all .
KJV	Luke	4	16	And he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up : and , as his custom was , he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and stood up for to read .
KJV	Luke	4	17	And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias . And when he had opened the book , he found the place where it was written ,
KJV	Luke	4	18	The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor ; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted , to preach deliverance to the captives , and recovering of sight to the blind , to set at liberty them that are bruised ,
KJV	Luke	4	19	To preach the acceptable year of the Lord .
KJV	Luke	4	20	And he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down . And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him .
KJV	Luke	4	21	And he began to say unto them , This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears .
KJV	Luke	4	22	And all bare him witness , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth . And they said , Is not this Joseph 's son ?
KJV	Luke	4	23	And he said unto them , Ye will surely say unto me this proverb , Physician , heal thyself : whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum , do also here in thy country .
KJV	Luke	4	24	And he said , Verily I say unto you , No prophet is accepted in his own country .
KJV	Luke	4	25	But I tell you of a truth , many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months , when great famine was throughout all the land ;
KJV	Luke	4	26	But unto none of them was Elias sent , save unto Sarepta , a city of Sidon , unto a woman that was a widow .
KJV	Luke	4	27	And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , saving Naaman the Syrian .
KJV	Luke	4	28	And all they in the synagogue , when they heard these things , were filled with wrath ,
KJV	Luke	4	29	And rose up , and thrust him out of the city , and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built , that they might cast him down headlong .
KJV	Luke	4	30	But he passing through the midst of them went his way ,
KJV	Luke	4	31	And came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and taught them on the sabbath days .
KJV	Luke	4	32	And they were astonished at his doctrine : for his word was with power .
KJV	Luke	4	33	And in the synagogue there was a man , which had a spirit of an unclean devil , and cried out with a loud voice ,
KJV	Luke	4	34	Saying , Let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art ; the Holy One of God .
KJV	Luke	4	35	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him . And when the devil had thrown him in the midst , he came out of him , and hurt him not .
KJV	Luke	4	36	And they were all amazed , and spake among themselves , saying , What a word is this ! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits , and they come out .
KJV	Luke	4	37	And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about .
KJV	Luke	4	38	And he arose out of the synagogue , and entered into Simon 's house . And Simon 's wife 's mother was taken with a great fever ; and they besought him for her .
KJV	Luke	4	39	And he stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her : and immediately she arose and ministered unto them .
KJV	Luke	4	40	Now when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
KJV	Luke	4	41	And devils also came out of many , crying out , and saying , Thou art Christ the Son of God . And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak : for they knew that he was Christ .
KJV	Luke	4	42	And when it was day , he departed and went into a desert place : and the people sought him , and came unto him , and stayed him , that he should not depart from them .
KJV	Luke	4	43	And he said unto them , I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also : for therefore am I sent .
KJV	Luke	4	44	And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee .
KJV	Luke	5	5	And Simon answering said unto him , Master , we have toiled all the night , and have taken nothing : nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net .
KJV	Luke	5	2	And saw two ships standing by the lake : but the fishermen were gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
KJV	Luke	5	3	And he entered into one of the ships , which was Simon 's , and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land . And he sat down , and taught the people out of the ship .
KJV	Luke	5	4	Now when he had left speaking , he said unto Simon , Launch out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught .
KJV	Luke	5	6	And when they had this done , they inclosed a great multitude of fishes : and their net brake .
KJV	Luke	5	7	And they beckoned unto their partners , which were in the other ship , that they should come and help them . And they came , and filled both the ships , so that they began to sink .
KJV	Luke	5	8	When Simon Peter saw it , he fell down at Jesus ' knees , saying , Depart from me ; for I am a sinful man , O Lord .
KJV	Luke	5	9	For he was astonished , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken :
KJV	Luke	5	10	And so was also James , and John , the sons of Zebedee , which were partners with Simon . And Jesus said unto Simon , Fear not ; from henceforth thou shalt catch men .
KJV	Luke	5	11	And when they had brought their ships to land , they forsook all , and followed him .
KJV	Luke	5	12	And it came to pass , when he was in a certain city , behold a man full of leprosy : who seeing Jesus fell on his face , and besought him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
KJV	Luke	5	13	And he put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will : be thou clean . And immediately the leprosy departed from him .
KJV	Luke	5	14	And he charged him to tell no man : but go , and shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing , according as Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
KJV	Luke	5	15	But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him : and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed by him of their infirmities .
KJV	Luke	5	16	And he withdrew himself into the wilderness , and prayed .
KJV	Luke	5	17	And it came to pass on a certain day , as he was teaching , that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , which were come out of every town of Galilee , and Judaea , and Jerusalem : and the power of the Lord was present to heal them .
KJV	Luke	5	18	And , behold , men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy : and they sought means to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
KJV	Luke	5	19	And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude , they went upon the housetop , and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus .
KJV	Luke	5	20	And when he saw their faith , he said unto him , Man , thy sins are forgiven thee .
KJV	Luke	5	21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , Who is this which speaketh blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins , but God alone ?
KJV	Luke	5	22	But when Jesus perceived their thoughts , he answering said unto them , What reason ye in your hearts ?
KJV	Luke	5	23	Whether is easier , to say , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Rise up and walk ?
KJV	Luke	5	24	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins , ( he said unto the sick of the palsy , ) I say unto thee , Arise , and take up thy couch , and go into thine house .
KJV	Luke	5	25	And immediately he rose up before them , and took up that whereon he lay , and departed to his own house , glorifying God .
KJV	Luke	5	26	And they were all amazed , and they glorified God , and were filled with fear , saying , We have seen strange things to day .
KJV	Luke	5	27	And after these things he went forth , and saw a publican , named Levi , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he said unto him , Follow me .
KJV	Luke	5	28	And he left all , rose up , and followed him .
KJV	Luke	5	29	And Levi made him a great feast in his own house : and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them .
KJV	Luke	5	30	But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples , saying , Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners ?
KJV	Luke	5	31	And Jesus answering said unto them , They that are whole need not a physician ; but they that are sick .
KJV	Luke	5	32	I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
KJV	Luke	5	33	And they said unto him , Why do the disciples of John fast often , and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees ; but thine eat and drink ?
KJV	Luke	5	34	And he said unto them , Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
KJV	Luke	5	35	But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
KJV	Luke	5	36	And he spake also a parable unto them ; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old ; if otherwise , then both the new maketh a rent , and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old .
KJV	Luke	5	37	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles ; else the new wine will burst the bottles , and be spilled , and the bottles shall perish .
KJV	Luke	5	38	But new wine must be put into new bottles ; and both are preserved .
KJV	Luke	5	39	No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new : for he saith , The old is better .
KJV	Luke	6	6	And it came to pass also on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered .
KJV	Luke	6	2	And certain of the Pharisees said unto them , Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days ?
KJV	Luke	6	3	And Jesus answering them said , Have ye not read so much as this , what David did , when himself was an hungred , and they which were with him ;
KJV	Luke	6	4	How he went into the house of God , and did take and eat the shewbread , and gave also to them that were with him ; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone ?
KJV	Luke	6	5	And he said unto them , That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath .
KJV	Luke	6	7	And the scribes and Pharisees watched him , whether he would heal on the sabbath day ; that they might find an accusation against him .
KJV	Luke	6	8	But he knew their thoughts , and said to the man which had the withered hand , Rise up , and stand forth in the midst . And he arose and stood forth .
KJV	Luke	6	9	Then said Jesus unto them , I will ask you one thing ; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good , or to do evil ? to save life , or to destroy it ?
KJV	Luke	6	10	And looking round about upon them all , he said unto the man , Stretch forth thy hand . And he did so : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
KJV	Luke	6	11	And they were filled with madness ; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus .
KJV	Luke	6	12	And it came to pass in those days , that he went out into a mountain to pray , and continued all night in prayer to God .
KJV	Luke	6	13	And when it was day , he called unto him his disciples : and of them he chose twelve , whom also he named apostles ;
KJV	Luke	6	14	Simon , ( whom he also named Peter , ) and Andrew his brother , James and John , Philip and Bartholomew ,
KJV	Luke	6	15	Matthew and Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon called Zelotes ,
KJV	Luke	6	16	And Judas the brother of James , and Judas Iscariot , which also was the traitor .
KJV	Luke	6	17	And he came down with them , and stood in the plain , and the company of his disciples , and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem , and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon , which came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases ;
KJV	Luke	6	18	And they that were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed .
KJV	Luke	6	19	And the whole multitude sought to touch him : for there went virtue out of him , and healed them all .
KJV	Luke	6	20	And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said , Blessed be ye poor : for yours is the kingdom of God .
KJV	Luke	6	21	Blessed are ye that hunger now : for ye shall be filled . Blessed are ye that weep now : for ye shall laugh .
KJV	Luke	6	22	Blessed are ye , when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from their company , and shall reproach you , and cast out your name as evil , for the Son of man 's sake .
KJV	Luke	6	23	Rejoice ye in that day , and leap for joy : for , behold , your reward is great in heaven : for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets .
KJV	Luke	6	24	But woe unto you that are rich ! for ye have received your consolation .
KJV	Luke	6	25	Woe unto you that are full ! for ye shall hunger . Woe unto you that laugh now ! for ye shall mourn and weep .
KJV	Luke	6	26	Woe unto you , when all men shall speak well of you ! for so did their fathers to the false prophets .
KJV	Luke	6	27	But I say unto you which hear , Love your enemies , do good to them which hate you ,
KJV	Luke	6	28	Bless them that curse you , and pray for them which despitefully use you .
KJV	Luke	6	29	And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other ; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also .
KJV	Luke	6	30	Give to every man that asketh of thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again .
KJV	Luke	6	31	And as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise .
KJV	Luke	6	32	For if ye love them which love you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also love those that love them .
KJV	Luke	6	33	And if ye do good to them which do good to you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also do even the same .
KJV	Luke	6	34	And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive , what thank have ye ? for sinners also lend to sinners , to receive as much again .
KJV	Luke	6	35	But love ye your enemies , and do good , and lend , hoping for nothing again ; and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be the children of the Highest : for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil .
KJV	Luke	6	36	Be ye therefore merciful , as your Father also is merciful .
KJV	Luke	6	37	Judge not , and ye shall not be judged : condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned : forgive , and ye shall be forgiven :
KJV	Luke	6	38	Give , and it shall be given unto you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall men give into your bosom . For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again .
KJV	Luke	6	39	And he spake a parable unto them , Can the blind lead the blind ? shall they not both fall into the ditch ?
KJV	Luke	6	40	The disciple is not above his master : but every one that is perfect shall be as his master .
KJV	Luke	6	41	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
KJV	Luke	6	42	Either how canst thou say to thy brother , Brother , let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye , when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? Thou hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine own eye , and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother 's eye .
KJV	Luke	6	43	For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit ; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
KJV	Luke	6	44	For every tree is known by his own fruit . For of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes .
KJV	Luke	6	45	A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good ; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil : for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh .
KJV	Luke	6	46	And why call ye me , Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ?
KJV	Luke	6	47	Whosoever cometh to me , and heareth my sayings , and doeth them , I will shew you to whom he is like :
KJV	Luke	6	48	He is like a man which built an house , and digged deep , and laid the foundation on a rock : and when the flood arose , the stream beat vehemently upon that house , and could not shake it : for it was founded upon a rock .
KJV	Luke	6	49	But he that heareth , and doeth not , is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth ; against which the stream did beat vehemently , and immediately it fell ; and the ruin of that house was great .
KJV	Luke	7	7	Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee : but say in a word , and my servant shall be healed .
KJV	Luke	7	2	And a certain centurion 's servant , who was dear unto him , was sick , and ready to die .
KJV	Luke	7	3	And when he heard of Jesus , he sent unto him the elders of the Jews , beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant .
KJV	Luke	7	4	And when they came to Jesus , they besought him instantly , saying , That he was worthy for whom he should do this :
KJV	Luke	7	5	For he loveth our nation , and he hath built us a synagogue .
KJV	Luke	7	6	Then Jesus went with them . And when he was now not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to him , saying unto him , Lord , trouble not thyself : for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof :
KJV	Luke	7	8	For I also am a man set under authority , having under me soldiers , and I say unto one , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doeth it .
KJV	Luke	7	9	When Jesus heard these things , he marvelled at him , and turned him about , and said unto the people that followed him , I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
KJV	Luke	7	10	And they that were sent , returning to the house , found the servant whole that had been sick .
KJV	Luke	7	11	And it came to pass the day after , that he went into a city called Nain ; and many of his disciples went with him , and much people .
KJV	Luke	7	12	Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city , behold , there was a dead man carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow : and much people of the city was with her .
KJV	Luke	7	13	And when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said unto her , Weep not .
KJV	Luke	7	14	And he came and touched the bier : and they that bare him stood still . And he said , Young man , I say unto thee , Arise .
KJV	Luke	7	15	And he that was dead sat up , and began to speak . And he delivered him to his mother .
KJV	Luke	7	16	And there came a fear on all : and they glorified God , saying , That a great prophet is risen up among us ; and , That God hath visited his people .
KJV	Luke	7	17	And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea , and throughout all the region round about .
KJV	Luke	7	18	And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things .
KJV	Luke	7	19	And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus , saying , Art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ?
KJV	Luke	7	20	When the men were come unto him , they said , John Baptist hath sent us unto thee , saying , Art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ?
KJV	Luke	7	21	And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues , and of evil spirits ; and unto many that were blind he gave sight .
KJV	Luke	7	22	Then Jesus answering said unto them , Go your way , and tell John what things ye have seen and heard ; how that the blind see , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , to the poor the gospel is preached .
KJV	Luke	7	23	And blessed is he , whosoever shall not be offended in me .
KJV	Luke	7	24	And when the messengers of John were departed , he began to speak unto the people concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness for to see ? A reed shaken with the wind ?
KJV	Luke	7	25	But what went ye out for to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? Behold , they which are gorgeously apparelled , and live delicately , are in kings ' courts .
KJV	Luke	7	26	But what went ye out for to see ? A prophet ? Yea , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
KJV	Luke	7	27	This is he , of whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
KJV	Luke	7	28	For I say unto you , Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist : but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he .
KJV	Luke	7	29	And all the people that heard him , and the publicans , justified God , being baptized with the baptism of John .
KJV	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves , being not baptized of him .
KJV	Luke	7	31	And the Lord said , Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation ? and to what are they like ?
KJV	Luke	7	32	They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace , and calling one to another , and saying , We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned to you , and ye have not wept .
KJV	Luke	7	33	For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine ; and ye say , He hath a devil .
KJV	Luke	7	34	The Son of man is come eating and drinking ; and ye say , Behold a gluttonous man , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners !
KJV	Luke	7	35	But wisdom is justified of all her children .
KJV	Luke	7	36	And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . And he went into the Pharisee 's house , and sat down to meat .
KJV	Luke	7	37	And , behold , a woman in the city , which was a sinner , when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee 's house , brought an alabaster box of ointment ,
KJV	Luke	7	38	And stood at his feet behind him weeping , and began to wash his feet with tears , and did wipe them with the hairs of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment .
KJV	Luke	7	39	Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it , he spake within himself , saying , This man , if he were a prophet , would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him : for she is a sinner .
KJV	Luke	7	40	And Jesus answering said unto him , Simon , I have somewhat to say unto thee . And he saith , Master , say on .
KJV	Luke	7	41	There was a certain creditor which had two debtors : the one owed five hundred pence , and the other fifty .
KJV	Luke	7	42	And when they had nothing to pay , he frankly forgave them both . Tell me therefore , which of them will love him most ?
KJV	Luke	7	43	Simon answered and said , I suppose that he , to whom he forgave most . And he said unto him , Thou hast rightly judged .
KJV	Luke	7	44	And he turned to the woman , and said unto Simon , Seest thou this woman ? I entered into thine house , thou gavest me no water for my feet : but she hath washed my feet with tears , and wiped them with the hairs of her head .
KJV	Luke	7	45	Thou gavest me no kiss : but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet .
KJV	Luke	7	46	My head with oil thou didst not anoint : but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment .
KJV	Luke	7	47	Wherefore I say unto thee , Her sins , which are many , are forgiven ; for she loved much : but to whom little is forgiven , the same loveth little .
KJV	Luke	7	48	And he said unto her , Thy sins are forgiven .
KJV	Luke	7	49	And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves , Who is this that forgiveth sins also ?
KJV	Luke	7	50	And he said to the woman , Thy faith hath saved thee ; go in peace .
KJV	Luke	8	8	And other fell on good ground , and sprang up , and bare fruit an hundredfold . And when he had said these things , he cried , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
KJV	Luke	8	2	And certain women , which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities , Mary called Magdalene , out of whom went seven devils ,
KJV	Luke	8	3	And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod 's steward , and Susanna , and many others , which ministered unto him of their substance .
KJV	Luke	8	4	And when much people were gathered together , and were come to him out of every city , he spake by a parable :
KJV	Luke	8	5	A sower went out to sow his seed : and as he sowed , some fell by the way side ; and it was trodden down , and the fowls of the air devoured it .
KJV	Luke	8	6	And some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moisture .
KJV	Luke	8	7	And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprang up with it , and choked it .
KJV	Luke	8	9	And his disciples asked him , saying , What might this parable be ?
KJV	Luke	8	10	And he said , Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God : but to others in parables ; that seeing they might not see , and hearing they might not understand .
KJV	Luke	8	11	Now the parable is this : The seed is the word of God .
KJV	Luke	8	12	Those by the way side are they that hear ; then cometh the devil , and taketh away the word out of their hearts , lest they should believe and be saved .
KJV	Luke	8	13	They on the rock are they , which , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; and these have no root , which for a while believe , and in time of temptation fall away .
KJV	Luke	8	14	And that which fell among thorns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection .
KJV	Luke	8	15	But that on the good ground are they , which in an honest and good heart , having heard the word , keep it , and bring forth fruit with patience .
KJV	Luke	8	16	No man , when he hath lighted a candle , covereth it with a vessel , or putteth it under a bed ; but setteth it on a candlestick , that they which enter in may see the light .
KJV	Luke	8	17	For nothing is secret , that shall not be made manifest ; neither any thing hid , that shall not be known and come abroad .
KJV	Luke	8	18	Take heed therefore how ye hear : for whosoever hath , to him shall be given ; and whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have .
KJV	Luke	8	19	Then came to him his mother and his brethren , and could not come at him for the press .
KJV	Luke	8	20	And it was told him by certain which said , Thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee .
KJV	Luke	8	21	And he answered and said unto them , My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God , and do it .
KJV	Luke	8	22	Now it came to pass on a certain day , that he went into a ship with his disciples : and he said unto them , Let us go over unto the other side of the lake . And they launched forth .
KJV	Luke	8	23	But as they sailed he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filled with water , and were in jeopardy .
KJV	Luke	8	24	And they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Master , master , we perish . Then he arose , and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water : and they ceased , and there was a calm .
KJV	Luke	8	25	And he said unto them , Where is your faith ? And they being afraid wondered , saying one to another , What manner of man is this ! for he commandeth even the winds and water , and they obey him .
KJV	Luke	8	26	And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes , which is over against Galilee .
KJV	Luke	8	27	And when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , which had devils long time , and ware no clothes , neither abode in any house , but in the tombs .
KJV	Luke	8	28	When he saw Jesus , he cried out , and fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God most high ? I beseech thee , torment me not .
KJV	Luke	8	29	( For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For oftentimes it had caught him : and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters ; and he brake the bands , and was driven of the devil into the wilderness . )
KJV	Luke	8	30	And Jesus asked him , saying , What is thy name ? And he said , Legion : because many devils were entered into him .
KJV	Luke	8	31	And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep .
KJV	Luke	8	32	And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain : and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them . And he suffered them .
KJV	Luke	8	33	Then went the devils out of the man , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake , and were choked .
KJV	Luke	8	34	When they that fed them saw what was done , they fled , and went and told it in the city and in the country .
KJV	Luke	8	35	Then they went out to see what was done ; and came to Jesus , and found the man , out of whom the devils were departed , sitting at the feet of Jesus , clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
KJV	Luke	8	36	They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed .
KJV	Luke	8	37	Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them ; for they were taken with great fear : and he went up into the ship , and returned back again .
KJV	Luke	8	38	Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him : but Jesus sent him away , saying ,
KJV	Luke	8	39	Return to thine own house , and shew how great things God hath done unto thee . And he went his way , and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him .
KJV	Luke	8	40	And it came to pass , that , when Jesus was returned , the people gladly received him : for they were all waiting for him .
KJV	Luke	8	41	And , behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and besought him that he would come into his house :
KJV	Luke	8	42	For he had one only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she lay a dying . But as he went the people thronged him .
KJV	Luke	8	43	And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years , which had spent all her living upon physicians , neither could be healed of any ,
KJV	Luke	8	44	Came behind him , and touched the border of his garment : and immediately her issue of blood stanched .
KJV	Luke	8	45	And Jesus said , Who touched me ? When all denied , Peter and they that were with him said , Master , the multitude throng thee and press thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ?
KJV	Luke	8	46	And Jesus said , Somebody hath touched me : for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me .
KJV	Luke	8	47	And when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before him , she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him , and how she was healed immediately .
KJV	Luke	8	48	And he said unto her , Daughter , be of good comfort : thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace .
KJV	Luke	8	49	While he yet spake , there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue 's house , saying to him , Thy daughter is dead ; trouble not the Master .
KJV	Luke	8	50	But when Jesus heard it , he answered him , saying , Fear not : believe only , and she shall be made whole .
KJV	Luke	8	51	And when he came into the house , he suffered no man to go in , save Peter , and James , and John , and the father and the mother of the maiden .
KJV	Luke	8	52	And all wept , and bewailed her : but he said , Weep not ; she is not dead , but sleepeth .
KJV	Luke	8	53	And they laughed him to scorn , knowing that she was dead .
KJV	Luke	8	54	And he put them all out , and took her by the hand , and called , saying , Maid , arise .
KJV	Luke	8	55	And her spirit came again , and she arose straightway : and he commanded to give her meat .
KJV	Luke	8	56	And her parents were astonished : but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done .
KJV	Luke	9	9	And Herod said , John have I beheaded : but who is this , of whom I hear such things ? And he desired to see him .
KJV	Luke	9	2	And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God , and to heal the sick .
KJV	Luke	9	3	And he said unto them , Take nothing for your journey , neither staves , nor scrip , neither bread , neither money ; neither have two coats apiece .
KJV	Luke	9	4	And whatsoever house ye enter into , there abide , and thence depart .
KJV	Luke	9	5	And whosoever will not receive you , when ye go out of that city , shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them .
KJV	Luke	9	6	And they departed , and went through the towns , preaching the gospel , and healing every where .
KJV	Luke	9	7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him : and he was perplexed , because that it was said of some , that John was risen from the dead ;
KJV	Luke	9	8	And of some , that Elias had appeared ; and of others , that one of the old prophets was risen again .
KJV	Luke	9	10	And the apostles , when they were returned , told him all that they had done . And he took them , and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida .
KJV	Luke	9	11	And the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and spake unto them of the kingdom of God , and healed them that had need of healing .
KJV	Luke	9	12	And when the day began to wear away , then came the twelve , and said unto him , Send the multitude away , that they may go into the towns and country round about , and lodge , and get victuals : for we are here in a desert place .
KJV	Luke	9	13	But he said unto them , Give ye them to eat . And they said , We have no more but five loaves and two fishes ; except we should go and buy meat for all this people .
KJV	Luke	9	14	For they were about five thousand men . And he said to his disciples , Make them sit down by fifties in a company .
KJV	Luke	9	15	And they did so , and made them all sit down .
KJV	Luke	9	16	Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude .
KJV	Luke	9	17	And they did eat , and were all filled : and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets .
KJV	Luke	9	18	And it came to pass , as he was alone praying , his disciples were with him : and he asked them , saying , Whom say the people that I am ?
KJV	Luke	9	19	They answering said , John the Baptist ; but some say , Elias ; and others say , that one of the old prophets is risen again .
KJV	Luke	9	20	He said unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? Peter answering said , The Christ of God .
KJV	Luke	9	21	And he straitly charged them , and commanded them to tell no man that thing ;
KJV	Luke	9	22	Saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be slain , and be raised the third day .
KJV	Luke	9	23	And he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
KJV	Luke	9	24	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it : but whosoever will lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it .
KJV	Luke	9	25	For what is a man advantaged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ?
KJV	Luke	9	26	For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he shall come in his own glory , and in his Father 's , and of the holy angels .
KJV	Luke	9	27	But I tell you of a truth , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the kingdom of God .
KJV	Luke	9	28	And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings , he took Peter and John and James , and went up into a mountain to pray .
KJV	Luke	9	29	And as he prayed , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment was white and glistering .
KJV	Luke	9	30	And , behold , there talked with him two men , which were Moses and Elias :
KJV	Luke	9	31	Who appeared in glory , and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem .
KJV	Luke	9	32	But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : and when they were awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him .
KJV	Luke	9	33	And it came to pass , as they departed from him , Peter said unto Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias : not knowing what he said .
KJV	Luke	9	34	While he thus spake , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them : and they feared as they entered into the cloud .
KJV	Luke	9	35	And there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him .
KJV	Luke	9	36	And when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone . And they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
KJV	Luke	9	37	And it came to pass , that on the next day , when they were come down from the hill , much people met him .
KJV	Luke	9	38	And , behold , a man of the company cried out , saying , Master , I beseech thee , look upon my son : for he is mine only child .
KJV	Luke	9	39	And , lo , a spirit taketh him , and he suddenly crieth out ; and it teareth him that he foameth again , and bruising him hardly departeth from him .
KJV	Luke	9	40	And I besought thy disciples to cast him out ; and they could not .
KJV	Luke	9	41	And Jesus answering said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you , and suffer you ? Bring thy son hither .
KJV	Luke	9	42	And as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
KJV	Luke	9	43	And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God . But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did , he said unto his disciples ,
KJV	Luke	9	44	Let these sayings sink down into your ears : for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men .
KJV	Luke	9	45	But they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them , that they perceived it not : and they feared to ask him of that saying .
KJV	Luke	9	46	Then there arose a reasoning among them , which of them should be greatest .
KJV	Luke	9	47	And Jesus , perceiving the thought of their heart , took a child , and set him by him ,
KJV	Luke	9	48	And said unto them , Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me : for he that is least among you all , the same shall be great .
KJV	Luke	9	49	And John answered and said , Master , we saw one casting out devils in thy name ; and we forbad him , because he followeth not with us .
KJV	Luke	9	50	And Jesus said unto him , Forbid him not : for he that is not against us is for us .
KJV	Luke	9	51	And it came to pass , when the time was come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem ,
KJV	Luke	9	52	And sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the Samaritans , to make ready for him .
KJV	Luke	9	53	And they did not receive him , because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem .
KJV	Luke	9	54	And when his disciples James and John saw this , they said , Lord , wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven , and consume them , even as Elias did ?
KJV	Luke	9	55	But he turned , and rebuked them , and said , Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of .
KJV	Luke	9	56	For the Son of man is not come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . And they went to another village .
KJV	Luke	9	57	And it came to pass , that , as they went in the way , a certain man said unto him , Lord , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
KJV	Luke	9	58	And Jesus said unto him , Foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
KJV	Luke	9	59	And he said unto another , Follow me . But he said , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
KJV	Luke	9	60	Jesus said unto him , Let the dead bury their dead : but go thou and preach the kingdom of God .
KJV	Luke	9	61	And another also said , Lord , I will follow thee ; but let me first go bid them farewell , which are at home at my house .
KJV	Luke	9	62	And Jesus said unto him , No man , having put his hand to the plough , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God .
KJV	Luke	10	10	But into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you not , go your ways out into the streets of the same , and say ,
KJV	Luke	10	2	Therefore said he unto them , The harvest truly is great , but the labourers are few : pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he would send forth labourers into his harvest .
KJV	Luke	10	3	Go your ways : behold , I send you forth as lambs among wolves .
KJV	Luke	10	4	Carry neither purse , nor scrip , nor shoes : and salute no man by the way .
KJV	Luke	10	5	And into whatsoever house ye enter , first say , Peace be to this house .
KJV	Luke	10	6	And if the son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon it : if not , it shall turn to you again .
KJV	Luke	10	7	And in the same house remain , eating and drinking such things as they give : for the labourer is worthy of his hire . Go not from house to house .
KJV	Luke	10	8	And into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you :
KJV	Luke	10	9	And heal the sick that are therein , and say unto them , The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you .
KJV	Luke	10	11	Even the very dust of your city , which cleaveth on us , we do wipe off against you : notwithstanding be ye sure of this , that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you .
KJV	Luke	10	12	But I say unto you , that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom , than for that city .
KJV	Luke	10	13	Woe unto thee , Chorazin ! woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon , which have been done in you , they had a great while ago repented , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
KJV	Luke	10	14	But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment , than for you .
KJV	Luke	10	15	And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted to heaven , shalt be thrust down to hell .
KJV	Luke	10	16	He that heareth you heareth me ; and he that despiseth you despiseth me ; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me .
KJV	Luke	10	17	And the seventy returned again with joy , saying , Lord , even the devils are subject unto us through thy name .
KJV	Luke	10	18	And he said unto them , I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven .
KJV	Luke	10	19	Behold , I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
KJV	Luke	10	20	Notwithstanding in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subject unto you ; but rather rejoice , because your names are written in heaven .
KJV	Luke	10	21	In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit , and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes : even so , Father ; for so it seemed good in thy sight .
KJV	Luke	10	22	All things are delivered to me of my Father : and no man knoweth who the Son is , but the Father ; and who the Father is , but the Son , and he to whom the Son will reveal him .
KJV	Luke	10	23	And he turned him unto his disciples , and said privately , Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see :
KJV	Luke	10	24	For I tell you , that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
KJV	Luke	10	25	And , behold , a certain lawyer stood up , and tempted him , saying , Master , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ?
KJV	Luke	10	26	He said unto him , What is written in the law ? how readest thou ?
KJV	Luke	10	27	And he answering said , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thy mind ; and thy neighbour as thyself .
KJV	Luke	10	28	And he said unto him , Thou hast answered right : this do , and thou shalt live .
KJV	Luke	10	29	But he , willing to justify himself , said unto Jesus , And who is my neighbour ?
KJV	Luke	10	30	And Jesus answering said , A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell among thieves , which stripped him of his raiment , and wounded him , and departed , leaving him half dead .
KJV	Luke	10	31	And by chance there came down a certain priest that way : and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
KJV	Luke	10	32	And likewise a Levite , when he was at the place , came and looked on him , and passed by on the other side .
KJV	Luke	10	33	But a certain Samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was : and when he saw him , he had compassion on him ,
KJV	Luke	10	34	And went to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine , and set him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
KJV	Luke	10	35	And on the morrow when he departed , he took out two pence , and gave them to the host , and said unto him , Take care of him ; and whatsoever thou spendest more , when I come again , I will repay thee .
KJV	Luke	10	36	Which now of these three , thinkest thou , was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves ?
KJV	Luke	10	37	And he said , He that shewed mercy on him . Then said Jesus unto him , Go , and do thou likewise .
KJV	Luke	10	38	Now it came to pass , as they went , that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house .
KJV	Luke	10	39	And she had a sister called Mary , which also sat at Jesus ' feet , and heard his word .
KJV	Luke	10	40	But Martha was cumbered about much serving , and came to him , and said , Lord , dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone ? bid her therefore that she help me .
KJV	Luke	10	41	And Jesus answered and said unto her , Martha , Martha , thou art careful and troubled about many things :
KJV	Luke	10	42	But one thing is needful : and Mary hath chosen that good part , which shall not be taken away from her .
KJV	Luke	11	11	If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ? or if he ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a serpent ?
KJV	Luke	11	2	And he said unto them , When ye pray , say , Our Father which art in heaven , Hallowed be thy name . Thy kingdom come . Thy will be done , as in heaven , so in earth .
KJV	Luke	11	3	Give us day by day our daily bread .
KJV	Luke	11	4	And forgive us our sins ; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us . And lead us not into temptation ; but deliver us from evil .
KJV	Luke	11	5	And he said unto them , Which of you shall have a friend , and shall go unto him at midnight , and say unto him , Friend , lend me three loaves ;
KJV	Luke	11	6	For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me , and I have nothing to set before him ?
KJV	Luke	11	7	And he from within shall answer and say , Trouble me not : the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed ; I can not rise and give thee .
KJV	Luke	11	8	I say unto you , Though he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend , yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth .
KJV	Luke	11	9	And I say unto you , Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you .
KJV	Luke	11	10	For every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
KJV	Luke	11	12	Or if he shall ask an egg , will he offer him a scorpion ?
KJV	Luke	11	13	If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children : how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him ?
KJV	Luke	11	14	And he was casting out a devil , and it was dumb . And it came to pass , when the devil was gone out , the dumb spake ; and the people wondered .
KJV	Luke	11	15	But some of them said , He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils .
KJV	Luke	11	16	And others , tempting him , sought of him a sign from heaven .
KJV	Luke	11	17	But he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house divided against a house falleth .
KJV	Luke	11	18	If Satan also be divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub .
KJV	Luke	11	19	And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges .
KJV	Luke	11	20	But if I with the finger of God cast out devils , no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you .
KJV	Luke	11	21	When a strong man armed keepeth his palace , his goods are in peace :
KJV	Luke	11	22	But when a stronger than he shall come upon him , and overcome him , he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted , and divideth his spoils .
KJV	Luke	11	23	He that is not with me is against me : and he that gathereth not with me scattereth .
KJV	Luke	11	24	When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he saith , I will return unto my house whence I came out .
KJV	Luke	11	25	And when he cometh , he findeth it swept and garnished .
KJV	Luke	11	26	Then goeth he , and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
KJV	Luke	11	27	And it came to pass , as he spake these things , a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice , and said unto him , Blessed is the womb that bare thee , and the paps which thou hast sucked .
KJV	Luke	11	28	But he said , Yea rather , blessed are they that hear the word of God , and keep it .
KJV	Luke	11	29	And when the people were gathered thick together , he began to say , This is an evil generation : they seek a sign ; and there shall no sign be given it , but the sign of Jonas the prophet .
KJV	Luke	11	30	For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites , so shall also the Son of man be to this generation .
KJV	Luke	11	31	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and condemn them : for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and , behold , a greater than Solomon is here .
KJV	Luke	11	32	The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and , behold , a greater than Jonas is here .
KJV	Luke	11	33	No man , when he hath lighted a candle , putteth it in a secret place , neither under a bushel , but on a candlestick , that they which come in may see the light .
KJV	Luke	11	34	The light of the body is the eye : therefore when thine eye is single , thy whole body also is full of light ; but when thine eye is evil , thy body also is full of darkness .
KJV	Luke	11	35	Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness .
KJV	Luke	11	36	If thy whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light , as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light .
KJV	Luke	11	37	And as he spake , a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat .
KJV	Luke	11	38	And when the Pharisee saw it , he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner .
KJV	Luke	11	39	And the Lord said unto him , Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter ; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness .
KJV	Luke	11	40	Ye fools , did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also ?
KJV	Luke	11	41	But rather give alms of such things as ye have ; and , behold , all things are clean unto you .
KJV	Luke	11	42	But woe unto you , Pharisees ! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs , and pass over judgment and the love of God : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
KJV	Luke	11	43	Woe unto you , Pharisees ! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues , and greetings in the markets .
KJV	Luke	11	44	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them are not aware of them .
KJV	Luke	11	45	Then answered one of the lawyers , and said unto him , Master , thus saying thou reproachest us also .
KJV	Luke	11	46	And he said , Woe unto you also , ye lawyers ! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers .
KJV	Luke	11	47	Woe unto you ! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
KJV	Luke	11	48	Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers : for they indeed killed them , and ye build their sepulchres .
KJV	Luke	11	49	Therefore also said the wisdom of God , I will send them prophets and apostles , and some of them they shall slay and persecute :
KJV	Luke	11	50	That the blood of all the prophets , which was shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ;
KJV	Luke	11	51	From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple : verily I say unto you , It shall be required of this generation .
KJV	Luke	11	52	Woe unto you , lawyers ! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge : ye entered not in yourselves , and them that were entering in ye hindered .
KJV	Luke	11	53	And as he said these things unto them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently , and to provoke him to speak of many things :
KJV	Luke	11	54	Laying wait for him , and seeking to catch something out of his mouth , that they might accuse him .
KJV	Luke	12	12	For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say .
KJV	Luke	12	2	For there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; neither hid , that shall not be known .
KJV	Luke	12	3	Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light ; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops .
KJV	Luke	12	4	And I say unto you my friends , Be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
KJV	Luke	12	5	But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear : Fear him , which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell ; yea , I say unto you , Fear him .
KJV	Luke	12	6	Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings , and not one of them is forgotten before God ?
KJV	Luke	12	7	But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many sparrows .
KJV	Luke	12	8	Also I say unto you , Whosoever shall confess me before men , him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God :
KJV	Luke	12	9	But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God .
KJV	Luke	12	10	And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven .
KJV	Luke	12	11	And when they bring you unto the synagogues , and unto magistrates , and powers , take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer , or what ye shall say :
KJV	Luke	12	13	And one of the company said unto him , Master , speak to my brother , that he divide the inheritance with me .
KJV	Luke	12	14	And he said unto him , Man , who made me a judge or a divider over you ?
KJV	Luke	12	15	And he said unto them , Take heed , and beware of covetousness : for a man 's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth .
KJV	Luke	12	16	And he spake a parable unto them , saying , The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully :
KJV	Luke	12	17	And he thought within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have no room where to bestow my fruits ?
KJV	Luke	12	18	And he said , This will I do : I will pull down my barns , and build greater ; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods .
KJV	Luke	12	19	And I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years ; take thine ease , eat , drink , and be merry .
KJV	Luke	12	20	But God said unto him , Thou fool , this night thy soul shall be required of thee : then whose shall those things be , which thou hast provided ?
KJV	Luke	12	21	So is he that layeth up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God .
KJV	Luke	12	22	And he said unto his disciples , Therefore I say unto you , Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat ; neither for the body , what ye shall put on .
KJV	Luke	12	23	The life is more than meat , and the body is more than raiment .
KJV	Luke	12	24	Consider the ravens : for they neither sow nor reap ; which neither have storehouse nor barn ; and God feedeth them : how much more are ye better than the fowls ?
KJV	Luke	12	25	And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit ?
KJV	Luke	12	26	If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least , why take ye thought for the rest ?
KJV	Luke	12	27	Consider the lilies how they grow : they toil not , they spin not ; and yet I say unto you , that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
KJV	Luke	12	28	If then God so clothe the grass , which is to day in the field , and to morrow is cast into the oven ; how much more will he clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
KJV	Luke	12	29	And seek not ye what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doubtful mind .
KJV	Luke	12	30	For all these things do the nations of the world seek after : and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things .
KJV	Luke	12	31	But rather seek ye the kingdom of God ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
KJV	Luke	12	32	Fear not , little flock ; for it is your Father 's good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
KJV	Luke	12	33	Sell that ye have , and give alms ; provide yourselves bags which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief approacheth , neither moth corrupteth .
KJV	Luke	12	34	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
KJV	Luke	12	35	Let your loins be girded about , and your lights burning ;
KJV	Luke	12	36	And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; that when he cometh and knocketh , they may open unto him immediately .
KJV	Luke	12	37	Blessed are those servants , whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching : verily I say unto you , that he shall gird himself , and make them to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them .
KJV	Luke	12	38	And if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those servants .
KJV	Luke	12	39	And this know , that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through .
KJV	Luke	12	40	Be ye therefore ready also : for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not .
KJV	Luke	12	41	Then Peter said unto him , Lord , speakest thou this parable unto us , or even to all ?
KJV	Luke	12	42	And the Lord said , Who then is that faithful and wise steward , whom his lord shall make ruler over his household , to give them their portion of meat in due season ?
KJV	Luke	12	43	Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
KJV	Luke	12	44	Of a truth I say unto you , that he will make him ruler over all that he hath .
KJV	Luke	12	45	But and if that servant say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ;
KJV	Luke	12	46	The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him , and at an hour when he is not aware , and will cut him in sunder , and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers .
KJV	Luke	12	47	And that servant , which knew his lord 's will , and prepared not himself , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes .
KJV	Luke	12	48	But he that knew not , and did commit things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few stripes . For unto whomsoever much is given , of him shall be much required : and to whom men have committed much , of him they will ask the more .
KJV	Luke	12	49	I am come to send fire on the earth ; and what will I , if it be already kindled ?
KJV	Luke	12	50	But I have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished !
KJV	Luke	12	51	Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth ? I tell you , Nay ; but rather division :
KJV	Luke	12	52	For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three .
KJV	Luke	12	53	The father shall be divided against the son , and the son against the father ; the mother against the daughter , and the daughter against the mother ; the mother in law against her daughter in law , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
KJV	Luke	12	54	And he said also to the people , When ye see a cloud rise out of the west , straightway ye say , There cometh a shower ; and so it is .
KJV	Luke	12	55	And when ye see the south wind blow , ye say , There will be heat ; and it cometh to pass .
KJV	Luke	12	56	Ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth ; but how is it that ye do not discern this time ?
KJV	Luke	12	57	Yea , and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ?
KJV	Luke	12	58	When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate , as thou art in the way , give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him ; lest he hale thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and the officer cast thee into prison .
KJV	Luke	12	59	I tell thee , thou shalt not depart thence , till thou hast paid the very last mite .
KJV	Luke	13	13	And he laid his hands on her : and immediately she was made straight , and glorified God .
KJV	Luke	13	2	And Jesus answering said unto them , Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans , because they suffered such things ?
KJV	Luke	13	3	I tell you , Nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish .
KJV	Luke	13	4	Or those eighteen , upon whom the tower in Siloam fell , and slew them , think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem ?
KJV	Luke	13	5	I tell you , Nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish .
KJV	Luke	13	6	He spake also this parable ; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard ; and he came and sought fruit thereon , and found none .
KJV	Luke	13	7	Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard , Behold , these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree , and find none : cut it down ; why cumbereth it the ground ?
KJV	Luke	13	8	And he answering said unto him , Lord , let it alone this year also , till I shall dig about it , and dung it :
KJV	Luke	13	9	And if it bear fruit , well : and if not , then after that thou shalt cut it down .
KJV	Luke	13	10	And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath .
KJV	Luke	13	11	And , behold , there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and was bowed together , and could in no wise lift up herself .
KJV	Luke	13	12	And when Jesus saw her , he called her to him , and said unto her , Woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity .
KJV	Luke	13	14	And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation , because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day , and said unto the people , There are six days in which men ought to work : in them therefore come and be healed , and not on the sabbath day .
KJV	Luke	13	15	The Lord then answered him , and said , Thou hypocrite , doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall , and lead him away to watering ?
KJV	Luke	13	16	And ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan hath bound , lo , these eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day ?
KJV	Luke	13	17	And when he had said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
KJV	Luke	13	18	Then said he , Unto what is the kingdom of God like ? and whereunto shall I resemble it ?
KJV	Luke	13	19	It is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and cast into his garden ; and it grew , and waxed a great tree ; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it .
KJV	Luke	13	20	And again he said , Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God ?
KJV	Luke	13	21	It is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
KJV	Luke	13	22	And he went through the cities and villages , teaching , and journeying toward Jerusalem .
KJV	Luke	13	23	Then said one unto him , Lord , are there few that be saved ? And he said unto them ,
KJV	Luke	13	24	Strive to enter in at the strait gate : for many , I say unto you , will seek to enter in , and shall not be able .
KJV	Luke	13	25	When once the master of the house is risen up , and hath shut to the door , and ye begin to stand without , and to knock at the door , saying , Lord , Lord , open unto us ; and he shall answer and say unto you , I know you not whence ye are :
KJV	Luke	13	26	Then shall ye begin to say , We have eaten and drunk in thy presence , and thou hast taught in our streets .
KJV	Luke	13	27	But he shall say , I tell you , I know you not whence ye are ; depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity .
KJV	Luke	13	28	There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when ye shall see Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets , in the kingdom of God , and you yourselves thrust out .
KJV	Luke	13	29	And they shall come from the east , and from the west , and from the north , and from the south , and shall sit down in the kingdom of God .
KJV	Luke	13	30	And , behold , there are last which shall be first , and there are first which shall be last .
KJV	Luke	13	31	The same day there came certain of the Pharisees , saying unto him , Get thee out , and depart hence : for Herod will kill thee .
KJV	Luke	13	32	And he said unto them , Go ye , and tell that fox , Behold , I cast out devils , and I do cures to day and to morrow , and the third day I shall be perfected .
KJV	Luke	13	33	Nevertheless I must walk to day , and to morrow , and the day following : for it can not be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem .
KJV	Luke	13	34	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , which killest the prophets , and stonest them that are sent unto thee ; how often would I have gathered thy children together , as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings , and ye would not !
KJV	Luke	13	35	Behold , your house is left unto you desolate : and verily I say unto you , Ye shall not see me , until the time come when ye shall say , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord .
KJV	Luke	14	14	And thou shalt be blessed ; for they can not recompense thee : for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just .
KJV	Luke	14	2	And , behold , there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy .
KJV	Luke	14	3	And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ?
KJV	Luke	14	4	And they held their peace . And he took him , and healed him , and let him go ;
KJV	Luke	14	5	And answered them , saying , Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day ?
KJV	Luke	14	6	And they could not answer him again to these things .
KJV	Luke	14	7	And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden , when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms ; saying unto them .
KJV	Luke	14	8	When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding , sit not down in the highest room ; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him ;
KJV	Luke	14	9	And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee , Give this man place ; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room .
KJV	Luke	14	10	But when thou art bidden , go and sit down in the lowest room ; that when he that bade thee cometh , he may say unto thee , Friend , go up higher : then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee .
KJV	Luke	14	11	For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
KJV	Luke	14	12	Then said he also to him that bade him , When thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends , nor thy brethren , neither thy kinsmen , nor thy rich neighbours ; lest they also bid thee again , and a recompence be made thee .
KJV	Luke	14	13	But when thou makest a feast , call the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind :
KJV	Luke	14	15	And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things , he said unto him , Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God .
KJV	Luke	14	16	Then said he unto him , A certain man made a great supper , and bade many :
KJV	Luke	14	17	And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden , Come ; for all things are now ready .
KJV	Luke	14	18	And they all with one consent began to make excuse . The first said unto him , I have bought a piece of ground , and I must needs go and see it : I pray thee have me excused .
KJV	Luke	14	19	And another said , I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to prove them : I pray thee have me excused .
KJV	Luke	14	20	And another said , I have married a wife , and therefore I can not come .
KJV	Luke	14	21	So that servant came , and shewed his lord these things . Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant , Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in hither the poor , and the maimed , and the halt , and the blind .
KJV	Luke	14	22	And the servant said , Lord , it is done as thou hast commanded , and yet there is room .
KJV	Luke	14	23	And the lord said unto the servant , Go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled .
KJV	Luke	14	24	For I say unto you , That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper .
KJV	Luke	14	25	And there went great multitudes with him : and he turned , and said unto them ,
KJV	Luke	14	26	If any man come to me , and hate not his father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brethren , and sisters , yea , and his own life also , he can not be my disciple .
KJV	Luke	14	27	And whosoever doth not bear his cross , and come after me , can not be my disciple .
KJV	Luke	14	28	For which of you , intending to build a tower , sitteth not down first , and counteth the cost , whether he have sufficient to finish it ?
KJV	Luke	14	29	Lest haply , after he hath laid the foundation , and is not able to finish it , all that behold it begin to mock him ,
KJV	Luke	14	30	Saying , This man began to build , and was not able to finish .
KJV	Luke	14	31	Or what king , going to make war against another king , sitteth not down first , and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand ?
KJV	Luke	14	32	Or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and desireth conditions of peace .
KJV	Luke	14	33	So likewise , whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath , he can not be my disciple .
KJV	Luke	14	34	Salt is good : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be seasoned ?
KJV	Luke	14	35	It is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the dunghill ; but men cast it out . He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
KJV	Luke	15	15	And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country ; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine .
KJV	Luke	15	2	And the Pharisees and scribes murmured , saying , This man receiveth sinners , and eateth with them .
KJV	Luke	15	3	And he spake this parable unto them , saying ,
KJV	Luke	15	4	What man of you , having an hundred sheep , if he lose one of them , doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness , and go after that which is lost , until he find it ?
KJV	Luke	15	5	And when he hath found it , he layeth it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
KJV	Luke	15	6	And when he cometh home , he calleth together his friends and neighbours , saying unto them , Rejoice with me ; for I have found my sheep which was lost .
KJV	Luke	15	7	I say unto you , that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth , more than over ninety and nine just persons , which need no repentance .
KJV	Luke	15	8	Either what woman having ten pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , doth not light a candle , and sweep the house , and seek diligently till she find it ?
KJV	Luke	15	9	And when she hath found it , she calleth her friends and her neighbours together , saying , Rejoice with me ; for I have found the piece which I had lost .
KJV	Luke	15	10	Likewise , I say unto you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth .
KJV	Luke	15	11	And he said , A certain man had two sons :
KJV	Luke	15	12	And the younger of them said to his father , Father , give me the portion of goods that falleth to me . And he divided unto them his living .
KJV	Luke	15	13	And not many days after the younger son gathered all together , and took his journey into a far country , and there wasted his substance with riotous living .
KJV	Luke	15	14	And when he had spent all , there arose a mighty famine in that land ; and he began to be in want .
KJV	Luke	15	16	And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him .
KJV	Luke	15	17	And when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough and to spare , and I perish with hunger !
KJV	Luke	15	18	I will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and before thee ,
KJV	Luke	15	19	And am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
KJV	Luke	15	20	And he arose , and came to his father . But when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him .
KJV	Luke	15	21	And the son said unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight , and am no more worthy to be called thy son .
KJV	Luke	15	22	But the father said to his servants , Bring forth the best robe , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet :
KJV	Luke	15	23	And bring hither the fatted calf , and kill it ; and let us eat , and be merry :
KJV	Luke	15	24	For this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . And they began to be merry .
KJV	Luke	15	25	Now his elder son was in the field : and as he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard musick and dancing .
KJV	Luke	15	26	And he called one of the servants , and asked what these things meant .
KJV	Luke	15	27	And he said unto him , Thy brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe and sound .
KJV	Luke	15	28	And he was angry , and would not go in : therefore came his father out , and intreated him .
KJV	Luke	15	29	And he answering said to his father , Lo , these many years do I serve thee , neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment : and yet thou never gavest me a kid , that I might make merry with my friends :
KJV	Luke	15	30	But as soon as this thy son was come , which hath devoured thy living with harlots , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf .
KJV	Luke	15	31	And he said unto him , Son , thou art ever with me , and all that I have is thine .
KJV	Luke	15	32	It was meet that we should make merry , and be glad : for this thy brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found .
KJV	Luke	16	16	The law and the prophets were until John : since that time the kingdom of God is preached , and every man presseth into it .
KJV	Luke	16	2	And he called him , and said unto him , How is it that I hear this of thee ? give an account of thy stewardship ; for thou mayest be no longer steward .
KJV	Luke	16	3	Then the steward said within himself , What shall I do ? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship : I can not dig ; to beg I am ashamed .
KJV	Luke	16	4	I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
KJV	Luke	16	5	So he called every one of his lord 's debtors unto him , and said unto the first , How much owest thou unto my lord ?
KJV	Luke	16	6	And he said , An hundred measures of oil . And he said unto him , Take thy bill , and sit down quickly , and write fifty .
KJV	Luke	16	7	Then said he to another , And how much owest thou ? And he said , An hundred measures of wheat . And he said unto him , Take thy bill , and write fourscore .
KJV	Luke	16	8	And the lord commended the unjust steward , because he had done wisely : for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light .
KJV	Luke	16	9	And I say unto you , Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness ; that , when ye fail , they may receive you into everlasting habitations .
KJV	Luke	16	10	He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much : and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much .
KJV	Luke	16	11	If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
KJV	Luke	16	12	And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man 's , who shall give you that which is your own ?
KJV	Luke	16	13	No servant can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon .
KJV	Luke	16	14	And the Pharisees also , who were covetous , heard all these things : and they derided him .
KJV	Luke	16	15	And he said unto them , Ye are they which justify yourselves before men ; but God knoweth your hearts : for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God .
KJV	Luke	16	17	And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass , than one tittle of the law to fail .
KJV	Luke	16	18	Whosoever putteth away his wife , and marrieth another , committeth adultery : and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery .
KJV	Luke	16	19	There was a certain rich man , which was clothed in purple and fine linen , and fared sumptuously every day :
KJV	Luke	16	20	And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus , which was laid at his gate , full of sores ,
KJV	Luke	16	21	And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man 's table : moreover the dogs came and licked his sores .
KJV	Luke	16	22	And it came to pass , that the beggar died , and was carried by the angels into Abraham 's bosom : the rich man also died , and was buried ;
KJV	Luke	16	23	And in hell he lift up his eyes , being in torments , and seeth Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom .
KJV	Luke	16	24	And he cried and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ; for I am tormented in this flame .
KJV	Luke	16	25	But Abraham said , Son , remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things , and likewise Lazarus evil things : but now he is comforted , and thou art tormented .
KJV	Luke	16	26	And beside all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed : so that they which would pass from hence to you can not ; neither can they pass to us , that would come from thence .
KJV	Luke	16	27	Then he said , I pray thee therefore , father , that thou wouldest send him to my father 's house :
KJV	Luke	16	28	For I have five brethren ; that he may testify unto them , lest they also come into this place of torment .
KJV	Luke	16	29	Abraham saith unto him , They have Moses and the prophets ; let them hear them .
KJV	Luke	16	30	And he said , Nay , father Abraham : but if one went unto them from the dead , they will repent .
KJV	Luke	16	31	And he said unto him , If they hear not Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded , though one rose from the dead .
KJV	Luke	17	17	And Jesus answering said , Were there not ten cleansed ? but where are the nine ?
KJV	Luke	17	2	It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he cast into the sea , than that he should offend one of these little ones .
KJV	Luke	17	3	Take heed to yourselves : If thy brother trespass against thee , rebuke him ; and if he repent , forgive him .
KJV	Luke	17	4	And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to thee , saying , I repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
KJV	Luke	17	5	And the apostles said unto the Lord , Increase our faith .
KJV	Luke	17	6	And the Lord said , If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye might say unto this sycamine tree , Be thou plucked up by the root , and be thou planted in the sea ; and it should obey you .
KJV	Luke	17	7	But which of you , having a servant plowing or feeding cattle , will say unto him by and by , when he is come from the field , Go and sit down to meat ?
KJV	Luke	17	8	And will not rather say unto him , Make ready wherewith I may sup , and gird thyself , and serve me , till I have eaten and drunken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ?
KJV	Luke	17	9	Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him ? I trow not .
KJV	Luke	17	10	So likewise ye , when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you , say , We are unprofitable servants : we have done that which was our duty to do .
KJV	Luke	17	11	And it came to pass , as he went to Jerusalem , that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee .
KJV	Luke	17	12	And as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , which stood afar off :
KJV	Luke	17	13	And they lifted up their voices , and said , Jesus , Master , have mercy on us .
KJV	Luke	17	14	And when he saw them , he said unto them , Go shew yourselves unto the priests . And it came to pass , that , as they went , they were cleansed .
KJV	Luke	17	15	And one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , and with a loud voice glorified God ,
KJV	Luke	17	16	And fell down on his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a Samaritan .
KJV	Luke	17	18	There are not found that returned to give glory to God , save this stranger .
KJV	Luke	17	19	And he said unto him , Arise , go thy way : thy faith hath made thee whole .
KJV	Luke	17	20	And when he was demanded of the Pharisees , when the kingdom of God should come , he answered them and said , The kingdom of God cometh not with observation :
KJV	Luke	17	21	Neither shall they say , Lo here ! or , lo there ! for , behold , the kingdom of God is within you .
KJV	Luke	17	22	And he said unto the disciples , The days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , and ye shall not see it .
KJV	Luke	17	23	And they shall say to you , See here ; or , see there : go not after them , nor follow them .
KJV	Luke	17	24	For as the lightning , that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day .
KJV	Luke	17	25	But first must he suffer many things , and be rejected of this generation .
KJV	Luke	17	26	And as it was in the days of Noe , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man .
KJV	Luke	17	27	They did eat , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
KJV	Luke	17	28	Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot ; they did eat , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they builded ;
KJV	Luke	17	29	But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all .
KJV	Luke	17	30	Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed .
KJV	Luke	17	31	In that day , he which shall be upon the housetop , and his stuff in the house , let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back .
KJV	Luke	17	32	Remember Lot 's wife .
KJV	Luke	17	33	Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it ; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it .
KJV	Luke	17	34	I tell you , in that night there shall be two men in one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .
KJV	Luke	17	35	Two women shall be grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
KJV	Luke	17	36	Two men shall be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
KJV	Luke	17	37	And they answered and said unto him , Where , Lord ? And he said unto them , Wheresoever the body is , thither will the eagles be gathered together .
KJV	Luke	18	18	And a certain ruler asked him , saying , Good Master , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ?
KJV	Luke	18	2	Saying , There was in a city a judge , which feared not God , neither regarded man :
KJV	Luke	18	3	And there was a widow in that city ; and she came unto him , saying , Avenge me of mine adversary .
KJV	Luke	18	4	And he would not for a while : but afterward he said within himself , Though I fear not God , nor regard man ;
KJV	Luke	18	5	Yet because this widow troubleth me , I will avenge her , lest by her continual coming she weary me .
KJV	Luke	18	6	And the Lord said , Hear what the unjust judge saith .
KJV	Luke	18	7	And shall not God avenge his own elect , which cry day and night unto him , though he bear long with them ?
KJV	Luke	18	8	I tell you that he will avenge them speedily . Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ?
KJV	Luke	18	9	And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and despised others :
KJV	Luke	18	10	Two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a Pharisee , and the other a publican .
KJV	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , God , I thank thee , that I am not as other men are , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this publican .
KJV	Luke	18	12	I fast twice in the week , I give tithes of all that I possess .
KJV	Luke	18	13	And the publican , standing afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , God be merciful to me a sinner .
KJV	Luke	18	14	I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
KJV	Luke	18	15	And they brought unto him also infants , that he would touch them : but when his disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
KJV	Luke	18	16	But Jesus called them unto him , and said , Suffer little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God .
KJV	Luke	18	17	Verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein .
KJV	Luke	18	19	And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? none is good , save one , that is , God .
KJV	Luke	18	20	Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honour thy father and thy mother .
KJV	Luke	18	21	And he said , All these have I kept from my youth up .
KJV	Luke	18	22	Now when Jesus heard these things , he said unto him , Yet lackest thou one thing : sell all that thou hast , and distribute unto the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me .
KJV	Luke	18	23	And when he heard this , he was very sorrowful : for he was very rich .
KJV	Luke	18	24	And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful , he said , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
KJV	Luke	18	25	For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle 's eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
KJV	Luke	18	26	And they that heard it said , Who then can be saved ?
KJV	Luke	18	27	And he said , The things which are impossible with men are possible with God .
KJV	Luke	18	28	Then Peter said , Lo , we have left all , and followed thee .
KJV	Luke	18	29	And he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or parents , or brethren , or wife , or children , for the kingdom of God 's sake ,
KJV	Luke	18	30	Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time , and in the world to come life everlasting .
KJV	Luke	18	31	Then he took unto him the twelve , and said unto them , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished .
KJV	Luke	18	32	For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles , and shall be mocked , and spitefully entreated , and spitted on :
KJV	Luke	18	33	And they shall scourge him , and put him to death : and the third day he shall rise again .
KJV	Luke	18	34	And they understood none of these things : and this saying was hid from them , neither knew they the things which were spoken .
KJV	Luke	18	35	And it came to pass , that as he was come nigh unto Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the way side begging :
KJV	Luke	18	36	And hearing the multitude pass by , he asked what it meant .
KJV	Luke	18	37	And they told him , that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by .
KJV	Luke	18	38	And he cried , saying , Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me .
KJV	Luke	18	39	And they which went before rebuked him , that he should hold his peace : but he cried so much the more , Thou son of David , have mercy on me .
KJV	Luke	18	40	And Jesus stood , and commanded him to be brought unto him : and when he was come near , he asked him ,
KJV	Luke	18	41	Saying , What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee ? And he said , Lord , that I may receive my sight .
KJV	Luke	18	42	And Jesus said unto him , Receive thy sight : thy faith hath saved thee .
KJV	Luke	18	43	And immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying God : and all the people , when they saw it , gave praise unto God .
KJV	Luke	19	19	And he said likewise to him , Be thou also over five cities .
KJV	Luke	19	2	And , behold , there was a man named Zacchaeus , which was the chief among the publicans , and he was rich .
KJV	Luke	19	3	And he sought to see Jesus who he was ; and could not for the press , because he was little of stature .
KJV	Luke	19	4	And he ran before , and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him : for he was to pass that way .
KJV	Luke	19	5	And when Jesus came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said unto him , Zacchaeus , make haste , and come down ; for to day I must abide at thy house .
KJV	Luke	19	6	And he made haste , and came down , and received him joyfully .
KJV	Luke	19	7	And when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner .
KJV	Luke	19	8	And Zacchaeus stood , and said unto the Lord : Behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor ; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation , I restore him fourfold .
KJV	Luke	19	9	And Jesus said unto him , This day is salvation come to this house , forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham .
KJV	Luke	19	10	For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost .
KJV	Luke	19	11	And as they heard these things , he added and spake a parable , because he was nigh to Jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear .
KJV	Luke	19	12	He said therefore , A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
KJV	Luke	19	13	And he called his ten servants , and delivered them ten pounds , and said unto them , Occupy till I come .
KJV	Luke	19	14	But his citizens hated him , and sent a message after him , saying , We will not have this man to reign over us .
KJV	Luke	19	15	And it came to pass , that when he was returned , having received the kingdom , then he commanded these servants to be called unto him , to whom he had given the money , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading .
KJV	Luke	19	16	Then came the first , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained ten pounds .
KJV	Luke	19	17	And he said unto him , Well , thou good servant : because thou hast been faithful in a very little , have thou authority over ten cities .
KJV	Luke	19	18	And the second came , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained five pounds .
KJV	Luke	19	20	And another came , saying , Lord , behold , here is thy pound , which I have kept laid up in a napkin :
KJV	Luke	19	21	For I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up that thou layedst not down , and reapest that thou didst not sow .
KJV	Luke	19	22	And he saith unto him , Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee , thou wicked servant . Thou knewest that I was an austere man , taking up that I laid not down , and reaping that I did not sow :
KJV	Luke	19	23	Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank , that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury ?
KJV	Luke	19	24	And he said unto them that stood by , Take from him the pound , and give it to him that hath ten pounds .
KJV	Luke	19	25	( And they said unto him , Lord , he hath ten pounds . )
KJV	Luke	19	26	For I say unto you , That unto every one which hath shall be given ; and from him that hath not , even that he hath shall be taken away from him .
KJV	Luke	19	27	But those mine enemies , which would not that I should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me .
KJV	Luke	19	28	And when he had thus spoken , he went before , ascending up to Jerusalem .
KJV	Luke	19	29	And it came to pass , when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount called the mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples ,
KJV	Luke	19	30	Saying , Go ye into the village over against you ; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied , whereon yet never man sat : loose him , and bring him hither .
KJV	Luke	19	31	And if any man ask you , Why do ye loose him ? thus shall ye say unto him , Because the Lord hath need of him .
KJV	Luke	19	32	And they that were sent went their way , and found even as he had said unto them .
KJV	Luke	19	33	And as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said unto them , Why loose ye the colt ?
KJV	Luke	19	34	And they said , The Lord hath need of him .
KJV	Luke	19	35	And they brought him to Jesus : and they cast their garments upon the colt , and they set Jesus thereon .
KJV	Luke	19	36	And as he went , they spread their clothes in the way .
KJV	Luke	19	37	And when he was come nigh , even now at the descent of the mount of Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen ;
KJV	Luke	19	38	Saying , Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest .
KJV	Luke	19	39	And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him , Master , rebuke thy disciples .
KJV	Luke	19	40	And he answered and said unto them , I tell you that , if these should hold their peace , the stones would immediately cry out .
KJV	Luke	19	41	And when he was come near , he beheld the city , and wept over it ,
KJV	Luke	19	42	Saying , If thou hadst known , even thou , at least in this thy day , the things which belong unto thy peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes .
KJV	Luke	19	43	For the days shall come upon thee , that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and compass thee round , and keep thee in on every side ,
KJV	Luke	19	44	And shall lay thee even with the ground , and thy children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation .
KJV	Luke	19	45	And he went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold therein , and them that bought ;
KJV	Luke	19	46	Saying unto them , It is written , My house is the house of prayer : but ye have made it a den of thieves .
KJV	Luke	19	47	And he taught daily in the temple . But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him ,
KJV	Luke	19	48	And could not find what they might do : for all the people were very attentive to hear him .
KJV	Luke	20	20	And they watched him , and sent forth spies , which should feign themselves just men , that they might take hold of his words , that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor .
KJV	Luke	20	2	And spake unto him , saying , Tell us , by what authority doest thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ?
KJV	Luke	20	3	And he answered and said unto them , I will also ask you one thing ; and answer me :
KJV	Luke	20	4	The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or of men ?
KJV	Luke	20	5	And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then believed ye him not ?
KJV	Luke	20	6	But and if we say , Of men ; all the people will stone us : for they be persuaded that John was a prophet .
KJV	Luke	20	7	And they answered , that they could not tell whence it was .
KJV	Luke	20	8	And Jesus said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things .
KJV	Luke	20	9	Then began he to speak to the people this parable ; A certain man planted a vineyard , and let it forth to husbandmen , and went into a far country for a long time .
KJV	Luke	20	10	And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the husbandmen beat him , and sent him away empty .
KJV	Luke	20	11	And again he sent another servant : and they beat him also , and entreated him shamefully , and sent him away empty .
KJV	Luke	20	12	And again he sent a third : and they wounded him also , and cast him out .
KJV	Luke	20	13	Then said the lord of the vineyard , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son : it may be they will reverence him when they see him .
KJV	Luke	20	14	But when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir : come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
KJV	Luke	20	15	So they cast him out of the vineyard , and killed him . What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
KJV	Luke	20	16	He shall come and destroy these husbandmen , and shall give the vineyard to others . And when they heard it , they said , God forbid .
KJV	Luke	20	17	And he beheld them , and said , What is this then that is written , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner ?
KJV	Luke	20	18	Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken ; but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder .
KJV	Luke	20	19	And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them .
KJV	Luke	20	21	And they asked him , saying , Master , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , neither acceptest thou the person of any , but teachest the way of God truly :
KJV	Luke	20	22	Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar , or no ?
KJV	Luke	20	23	But he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them , Why tempt ye me ?
KJV	Luke	20	24	Shew me a penny . Whose image and superscription hath it ? They answered and said , Caesar 's .
KJV	Luke	20	25	And he said unto them , Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar 's , and unto God the things which be God 's .
KJV	Luke	20	26	And they could not take hold of his words before the people : and they marvelled at his answer , and held their peace .
KJV	Luke	20	27	Then came to him certain of the Sadducees , which deny that there is any resurrection ; and they asked him ,
KJV	Luke	20	28	Saying , Master , Moses wrote unto us , If any man 's brother die , having a wife , and he die without children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
KJV	Luke	20	29	There were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died without children .
KJV	Luke	20	30	And the second took her to wife , and he died childless .
KJV	Luke	20	31	And the third took her ; and in like manner the seven also : and they left no children , and died .
KJV	Luke	20	32	Last of all the woman died also .
KJV	Luke	20	33	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she ? for seven had her to wife .
KJV	Luke	20	34	And Jesus answering said unto them , The children of this world marry , and are given in marriage :
KJV	Luke	20	35	But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage :
KJV	Luke	20	36	Neither can they die any more : for they are equal unto the angels ; and are the children of God , being the children of the resurrection .
KJV	Luke	20	37	Now that the dead are raised , even Moses shewed at the bush , when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob .
KJV	Luke	20	38	For he is not a God of the dead , but of the living : for all live unto him .
KJV	Luke	20	39	Then certain of the scribes answering said , Master , thou hast well said .
KJV	Luke	20	40	And after that they durst not ask him any question at all .
KJV	Luke	20	41	And he said unto them , How say they that Christ is David 's son ?
KJV	Luke	20	42	And David himself saith in the book of Psalms , The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand ,
KJV	Luke	20	43	Till I make thine enemies thy footstool .
KJV	Luke	20	44	David therefore calleth him Lord , how is he then his son ?
KJV	Luke	20	45	Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples ,
KJV	Luke	20	46	Beware of the scribes , which desire to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the markets , and the highest seats in the synagogues , and the chief rooms at feasts ;
KJV	Luke	20	47	Which devour widows ' houses , and for a shew make long prayers : the same shall receive greater damnation .
KJV	Luke	21	21	Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto .
KJV	Luke	21	2	And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites .
KJV	Luke	21	3	And he said , Of a truth I say unto you , that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all :
KJV	Luke	21	4	For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God : but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had .
KJV	Luke	21	5	And as some spake of the temple , how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts , he said ,
KJV	Luke	21	6	As for these things which ye behold , the days will come , in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
KJV	Luke	21	7	And they asked him , saying , Master , but when shall these things be ? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass ?
KJV	Luke	21	8	And he said , Take heed that ye be not deceived : for many shall come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and the time draweth near : go ye not therefore after them .
KJV	Luke	21	9	But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by .
KJV	Luke	21	10	Then said he unto them , Nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom :
KJV	Luke	21	11	And great earthquakes shall be in divers places , and famines , and pestilences ; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven .
KJV	Luke	21	12	But before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues , and into prisons , being brought before kings and rulers for my name 's sake .
KJV	Luke	21	13	And it shall turn to you for a testimony .
KJV	Luke	21	14	Settle it therefore in your hearts , not to meditate before what ye shall answer :
KJV	Luke	21	15	For I will give you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist .
KJV	Luke	21	16	And ye shall be betrayed both by parents , and brethren , and kinsfolks , and friends ; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death .
KJV	Luke	21	17	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name 's sake .
KJV	Luke	21	18	But there shall not an hair of your head perish .
KJV	Luke	21	19	In your patience possess ye your souls .
KJV	Luke	21	20	And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies , then know that the desolation thereof is nigh .
KJV	Luke	21	22	For these be the days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
KJV	Luke	21	23	But woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck , in those days ! for there shall be great distress in the land , and wrath upon this people .
KJV	Luke	21	24	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led away captive into all nations : and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled .
KJV	Luke	21	25	And there shall be signs in the sun , and in the moon , and in the stars ; and upon the earth distress of nations , with perplexity ; the sea and the waves roaring ;
KJV	Luke	21	26	Men 's hearts failing them for fear , and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth : for the powers of heaven shall be shaken .
KJV	Luke	21	27	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
KJV	Luke	21	28	And when these things begin to come to pass , then look up , and lift up your heads ; for your redemption draweth nigh .
KJV	Luke	21	29	And he spake to them a parable ; Behold the fig tree , and all the trees ;
KJV	Luke	21	30	When they now shoot forth , ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand .
KJV	Luke	21	31	So likewise ye , when ye see these things come to pass , know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand .
KJV	Luke	21	32	Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass away , till all be fulfilled .
KJV	Luke	21	33	Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
KJV	Luke	21	34	And take heed to yourselves , lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting , and drunkenness , and cares of this life , and so that day come upon you unawares .
KJV	Luke	21	35	For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth .
KJV	Luke	21	36	Watch ye therefore , and pray always , that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass , and to stand before the Son of man .
KJV	Luke	21	37	And in the day time he was teaching in the temple ; and at night he went out , and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives .
KJV	Luke	21	38	And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple , for to hear him .
KJV	Luke	22	22	And truly the Son of man goeth , as it was determined : but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed !
KJV	Luke	22	2	And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him ; for they feared the people .
KJV	Luke	22	3	Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot , being of the number of the twelve .
KJV	Luke	22	4	And he went his way , and communed with the chief priests and captains , how he might betray him unto them .
KJV	Luke	22	5	And they were glad , and covenanted to give him money .
KJV	Luke	22	6	And he promised , and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude .
KJV	Luke	22	7	Then came the day of unleavened bread , when the passover must be killed .
KJV	Luke	22	8	And he sent Peter and John , saying , Go and prepare us the passover , that we may eat .
KJV	Luke	22	9	And they said unto him , Where wilt thou that we prepare ?
KJV	Luke	22	10	And he said unto them , Behold , when ye are entered into the city , there shall a man meet you , bearing a pitcher of water ; follow him into the house where he entereth in .
KJV	Luke	22	11	And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house , The Master saith unto thee , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
KJV	Luke	22	12	And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished : there make ready .
KJV	Luke	22	13	And they went , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
KJV	Luke	22	14	And when the hour was come , he sat down , and the twelve apostles with him .
KJV	Luke	22	15	And he said unto them , With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer :
KJV	Luke	22	16	For I say unto you , I will not any more eat thereof , until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God .
KJV	Luke	22	17	And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , Take this , and divide it among yourselves :
KJV	Luke	22	18	For I say unto you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God shall come .
KJV	Luke	22	19	And he took bread , and gave thanks , and brake it , and gave unto them , saying , This is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me .
KJV	Luke	22	20	Likewise also the cup after supper , saying , This cup is the new testament in my blood , which is shed for you .
KJV	Luke	22	21	But , behold , the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table .
KJV	Luke	22	23	And they began to enquire among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing .
KJV	Luke	22	24	And there was also a strife among them , which of them should be accounted the greatest .
KJV	Luke	22	25	And he said unto them , The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors .
KJV	Luke	22	26	But ye shall not be so : but he that is greatest among you , let him be as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that doth serve .
KJV	Luke	22	27	For whether is greater , he that sitteth at meat , or he that serveth ? is not he that sitteth at meat ? but I am among you as he that serveth .
KJV	Luke	22	28	Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations .
KJV	Luke	22	29	And I appoint unto you a kingdom , as my Father hath appointed unto me ;
KJV	Luke	22	30	That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
KJV	Luke	22	31	And the Lord said , Simon , Simon , behold , Satan hath desired to have you , that he may sift you as wheat :
KJV	Luke	22	32	But I have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not : and when thou art converted , strengthen thy brethren .
KJV	Luke	22	33	And he said unto him , Lord , I am ready to go with thee , both into prison , and to death .
KJV	Luke	22	34	And he said , I tell thee , Peter , the cock shall not crow this day , before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me .
KJV	Luke	22	35	And he said unto them , When I sent you without purse , and scrip , and shoes , lacked ye any thing ? And they said , Nothing .
KJV	Luke	22	36	Then said he unto them , But now , he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise his scrip : and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one .
KJV	Luke	22	37	For I say unto you , that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me , And he was reckoned among the transgressors : for the things concerning me have an end .
KJV	Luke	22	38	And they said , Lord , behold , here are two swords . And he said unto them , It is enough .
KJV	Luke	22	39	And he came out , and went , as he was wont , to the mount of Olives ; and his disciples also followed him .
KJV	Luke	22	40	And when he was at the place , he said unto them , Pray that ye enter not into temptation .
KJV	Luke	22	41	And he was withdrawn from them about a stone 's cast , and kneeled down , and prayed ,
KJV	Luke	22	42	Saying , Father , if thou be willing , remove this cup from me : nevertheless not my will , but thine , be done .
KJV	Luke	22	43	And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven , strengthening him .
KJV	Luke	22	44	And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly : and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground .
KJV	Luke	22	45	And when he rose up from prayer , and was come to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow ,
KJV	Luke	22	46	And said unto them , Why sleep ye ? rise and pray , lest ye enter into temptation .
KJV	Luke	22	47	And while he yet spake , behold a multitude , and he that was called Judas , one of the twelve , went before them , and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him .
KJV	Luke	22	48	But Jesus said unto him , Judas , betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss ?
KJV	Luke	22	49	When they which were about him saw what would follow , they said unto him , Lord , shall we smite with the sword ?
KJV	Luke	22	50	And one of them smote the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
KJV	Luke	22	51	And Jesus answered and said , Suffer ye thus far . And he touched his ear , and healed him .
KJV	Luke	22	52	Then Jesus said unto the chief priests , and captains of the temple , and the elders , which were come to him , Be ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and staves ?
KJV	Luke	22	53	When I was daily with you in the temple , ye stretched forth no hands against me : but this is your hour , and the power of darkness .
KJV	Luke	22	54	Then took they him , and led him , and brought him into the high priest 's house . And Peter followed afar off .
KJV	Luke	22	55	And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall , and were set down together , Peter sat down among them .
KJV	Luke	22	56	But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire , and earnestly looked upon him , and said , This man was also with him .
KJV	Luke	22	57	And he denied him , saying , Woman , I know him not .
KJV	Luke	22	58	And after a little while another saw him , and said , Thou art also of them . And Peter said , Man , I am not .
KJV	Luke	22	59	And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed , saying , Of a truth this fellow also was with him : for he is a Galilaean .
KJV	Luke	22	60	And Peter said , Man , I know not what thou sayest . And immediately , while he yet spake , the cock crew .
KJV	Luke	22	61	And the Lord turned , and looked upon Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he had said unto him , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
KJV	Luke	22	62	And Peter went out , and wept bitterly .
KJV	Luke	22	63	And the men that held Jesus mocked him , and smote him .
KJV	Luke	22	64	And when they had blindfolded him , they struck him on the face , and asked him , saying , Prophesy , who is it that smote thee ?
KJV	Luke	22	65	And many other things blasphemously spake they against him .
KJV	Luke	22	66	And as soon as it was day , the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together , and led him into their council , saying ,
KJV	Luke	22	67	Art thou the Christ ? tell us . And he said unto them , If I tell you , ye will not believe :
KJV	Luke	22	68	And if I also ask you , ye will not answer me , nor let me go .
KJV	Luke	22	69	Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God .
KJV	Luke	22	70	Then said they all , Art thou then the Son of God ? And he said unto them , Ye say that I am .
KJV	Luke	22	71	And they said , What need we any further witness ? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth .
KJV	Luke	23	23	And they were instant with loud voices , requiring that he might be crucified . And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed .
KJV	Luke	23	2	And they began to accuse him , saying , We found this fellow perverting the nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , saying that he himself is Christ a King .
KJV	Luke	23	3	And Pilate asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answered him and said , Thou sayest it .
KJV	Luke	23	4	Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people , I find no fault in this man .
KJV	Luke	23	5	And they were the more fierce , saying , He stirreth up the people , teaching throughout all Jewry , beginning from Galilee to this place .
KJV	Luke	23	6	When Pilate heard of Galilee , he asked whether the man were a Galilaean .
KJV	Luke	23	7	And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time .
KJV	Luke	23	8	And when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceeding glad : for he was desirous to see him of a long season , because he had heard many things of him ; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him .
KJV	Luke	23	9	Then he questioned with him in many words ; but he answered him nothing .
KJV	Luke	23	10	And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him .
KJV	Luke	23	11	And Herod with his men of war set him at nought , and mocked him , and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe , and sent him again to Pilate .
KJV	Luke	23	12	And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together : for before they were at enmity between themselves .
KJV	Luke	23	13	And Pilate , when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
KJV	Luke	23	14	Said unto them , Ye have brought this man unto me , as one that perverteth the people : and , behold , I , having examined him before you , have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him :
KJV	Luke	23	15	No , nor yet Herod : for I sent you to him ; and , lo , nothing worthy of death is done unto him .
KJV	Luke	23	16	I will therefore chastise him , and release him .
KJV	Luke	23	17	( For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast . )
KJV	Luke	23	18	And they cried out all at once , saying , Away with this man , and release unto us Barabbas :
KJV	Luke	23	19	( Who for a certain sedition made in the city , and for murder , was cast into prison . )
KJV	Luke	23	20	Pilate therefore , willing to release Jesus , spake again to them .
KJV	Luke	23	21	But they cried , saying , Crucify him , crucify him .
KJV	Luke	23	22	And he said unto them the third time , Why , what evil hath he done ? I have found no cause of death in him : I will therefore chastise him , and let him go .
KJV	Luke	23	24	And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required .
KJV	Luke	23	25	And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison , whom they had desired ; but he delivered Jesus to their will .
KJV	Luke	23	26	And as they led him away , they laid hold upon one Simon , a Cyrenian , coming out of the country , and on him they laid the cross , that he might bear it after Jesus .
KJV	Luke	23	27	And there followed him a great company of people , and of women , which also bewailed and lamented him .
KJV	Luke	23	28	But Jesus turning unto them said , Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not for me , but weep for yourselves , and for your children .
KJV	Luke	23	29	For , behold , the days are coming , in the which they shall say , Blessed are the barren , and the wombs that never bare , and the paps which never gave suck .
KJV	Luke	23	30	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains , Fall on us ; and to the hills , Cover us .
KJV	Luke	23	31	For if they do these things in a green tree , what shall be done in the dry ?
KJV	Luke	23	32	And there were also two other , malefactors , led with him to be put to death .
KJV	Luke	23	33	And when they were come to the place , which is called Calvary , there they crucified him , and the malefactors , one on the right hand , and the other on the left .
KJV	Luke	23	34	Then said Jesus , Father , forgive them ; for they know not what they do . And they parted his raiment , and cast lots .
KJV	Luke	23	35	And the people stood beholding . And the rulers also with them derided him , saying , He saved others ; let him save himself , if he be Christ , the chosen of God .
KJV	Luke	23	36	And the soldiers also mocked him , coming to him , and offering him vinegar ,
KJV	Luke	23	37	And saying , If thou be the king of the Jews , save thyself .
KJV	Luke	23	38	And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and Hebrew , This Is The King Of The Jews .
KJV	Luke	23	39	And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him , saying , If thou be Christ , save thyself and us .
KJV	Luke	23	40	But the other answering rebuked him , saying , Dost not thou fear God , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ?
KJV	Luke	23	41	And we indeed justly ; for we receive the due reward of our deeds : but this man hath done nothing amiss .
KJV	Luke	23	42	And he said unto Jesus , Lord , remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom .
KJV	Luke	23	43	And Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , Today shalt thou be with me in paradise .
KJV	Luke	23	44	And it was about the sixth hour , and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour .
KJV	Luke	23	45	And the sun was darkened , and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst .
KJV	Luke	23	46	And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice , he said , Father , into thy hands I commend my spirit : and having said thus , he gave up the ghost .
KJV	Luke	23	47	Now when the centurion saw what was done , he glorified God , saying , Certainly this was a righteous man .
KJV	Luke	23	48	And all the people that came together to that sight , beholding the things which were done , smote their breasts , and returned .
KJV	Luke	23	49	And all his acquaintance , and the women that followed him from Galilee , stood afar off , beholding these things .
KJV	Luke	23	50	And , behold , there was a man named Joseph , a counsellor ; and he was a good man , and a just :
KJV	Luke	23	51	( The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them ; ) he was of Arimathaea , a city of the Jews : who also himself waited for the kingdom of God .
KJV	Luke	23	52	This man went unto Pilate , and begged the body of Jesus .
KJV	Luke	23	53	And he took it down , and wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone , wherein never man before was laid .
KJV	Luke	23	54	And that day was the preparation , and the sabbath drew on .
KJV	Luke	23	55	And the women also , which came with him from Galilee , followed after , and beheld the sepulchre , and how his body was laid .
KJV	Luke	23	56	And they returned , and prepared spices and ointments ; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment .
KJV	Luke	24	24	And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not .
KJV	Luke	24	2	And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre .
KJV	Luke	24	3	And they entered in , and found not the body of the Lord Jesus .
KJV	Luke	24	4	And it came to pass , as they were much perplexed thereabout , behold , two men stood by them in shining garments :
KJV	Luke	24	5	And as they were afraid , and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , Why seek ye the living among the dead ?
KJV	Luke	24	6	He is not here , but is risen : remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee ,
KJV	Luke	24	7	Saying , The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again .
KJV	Luke	24	8	And they remembered his words ,
KJV	Luke	24	9	And returned from the sepulchre , and told all these things unto the eleven , and to all the rest .
KJV	Luke	24	10	It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna , and Mary the mother of James , and other women that were with them , which told these things unto the apostles .
KJV	Luke	24	11	And their words seemed to them as idle tales , and they believed them not .
KJV	Luke	24	12	Then arose Peter , and ran unto the sepulchre ; and stooping down , he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves , and departed , wondering in himself at that which was come to pass .
KJV	Luke	24	13	And , behold , two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus , which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs .
KJV	Luke	24	14	And they talked together of all these things which had happened .
KJV	Luke	24	15	And it came to pass , that , while they communed together and reasoned , Jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
KJV	Luke	24	16	But their eyes were holden that they should not know him .
KJV	Luke	24	17	And he said unto them , What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another , as ye walk , and are sad ?
KJV	Luke	24	18	And the one of them , whose name was Cleopas , answering said unto him , Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem , and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days ?
KJV	Luke	24	19	And he said unto them , What things ? And they said unto him , Concerning Jesus of Nazareth , which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people :
KJV	Luke	24	20	And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death , and have crucified him .
KJV	Luke	24	21	But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel : and beside all this , to day is the third day since these things were done .
KJV	Luke	24	22	Yea , and certain women also of our company made us astonished , which were early at the sepulchre ;
KJV	Luke	24	23	And when they found not his body , they came , saying , that they had also seen a vision of angels , which said that he was alive .
KJV	Luke	24	25	Then he said unto them , O fools , and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken :
KJV	Luke	24	26	Ought not Christ to have suffered these things , and to enter into his glory ?
KJV	Luke	24	27	And beginning at Moses and all the prophets , he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself .
KJV	Luke	24	28	And they drew nigh unto the village , whither they went : and he made as though he would have gone further .
KJV	Luke	24	29	But they constrained him , saying , Abide with us : for it is toward evening , and the day is far spent . And he went in to tarry with them .
KJV	Luke	24	30	And it came to pass , as he sat at meat with them , he took bread , and blessed it , and brake , and gave to them .
KJV	Luke	24	31	And their eyes were opened , and they knew him ; and he vanished out of their sight .
KJV	Luke	24	32	And they said one to another , Did not our heart burn within us , while he talked with us by the way , and while he opened to us the scriptures ?
KJV	Luke	24	33	And they rose up the same hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
KJV	Luke	24	34	Saying , The Lord is risen indeed , and hath appeared to Simon .
KJV	Luke	24	35	And they told what things were done in the way , and how he was known of them in breaking of bread .
KJV	Luke	24	36	And as they thus spake , Jesus himself stood in the midst of them , and saith unto them , Peace be unto you .
KJV	Luke	24	37	But they were terrified and affrighted , and supposed that they had seen a spirit .
KJV	Luke	24	38	And he said unto them , Why are ye troubled ? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts ?
KJV	Luke	24	39	Behold my hands and my feet , that it is I myself : handle me , and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me have .
KJV	Luke	24	40	And when he had thus spoken , he shewed them his hands and his feet .
KJV	Luke	24	41	And while they yet believed not for joy , and wondered , he said unto them , Have ye here any meat ?
KJV	Luke	24	42	And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish , and of an honeycomb .
KJV	Luke	24	43	And he took it , and did eat before them .
KJV	Luke	24	44	And he said unto them , These are the words which I spake unto you , while I was yet with you , that all things must be fulfilled , which were written in the law of Moses , and in the prophets , and in the psalms , concerning me .
KJV	Luke	24	45	Then opened he their understanding , that they might understand the scriptures ,
KJV	Luke	24	46	And said unto them , Thus it is written , and thus it behooved Christ to suffer , and to rise from the dead the third day :
KJV	Luke	24	47	And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations , beginning at Jerusalem .
KJV	Luke	24	48	And ye are witnesses of these things .
KJV	Luke	24	49	And , behold , I send the promise of my Father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem , until ye be endued with power from on high .
KJV	Luke	24	50	And he led them out as far as to Bethany , and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them .
KJV	Luke	24	51	And it came to pass , while he blessed them , he was parted from them , and carried up into heaven .
KJV	Luke	24	52	And they worshipped him , and returned to Jerusalem with great joy :
KJV	Luke	24	53	And were continually in the temple , praising and blessing God . Amen .
KJV	John	1	1	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
KJV	John	1	2	The same was in the beginning with God .
KJV	John	1	3	All things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made that was made .
KJV	John	1	4	In him was life ; and the life was the light of men .
KJV	John	1	5	And the light shineth in darkness ; and the darkness comprehended it not .
KJV	John	1	6	There was a man sent from God , whose name was John .
KJV	John	1	7	The same came for a witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all men through him might believe .
KJV	John	1	8	He was not that Light , but was sent to bear witness of that Light .
KJV	John	1	9	That was the true Light , which lighteth every man that cometh into the world .
KJV	John	1	10	He was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not .
KJV	John	1	11	He came unto his own , and his own received him not .
KJV	John	1	12	But as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of God , even to them that believe on his name :
KJV	John	1	13	Which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
KJV	John	1	14	And the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , ( and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the Father , ) full of grace and truth .
KJV	John	1	15	John bare witness of him , and cried , saying , This was he of whom I spake , He that cometh after me is preferred before me : for he was before me .
KJV	John	1	16	And of his fulness have all we received , and grace for grace .
KJV	John	1	17	For the law was given by Moses , but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ .
KJV	John	1	18	No man hath seen God at any time , the only begotten Son , which is in the bosom of the Father , he hath declared him .
KJV	John	1	19	And this is the record of John , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , Who art thou ?
KJV	John	1	20	And he confessed , and denied not ; but confessed , I am not the Christ .
KJV	John	1	21	And they asked him , What then ? Art thou Elias ? And he saith , I am not . Art thou that prophet ? And he answered , No .
KJV	John	1	22	Then said they unto him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . What sayest thou of thyself ?
KJV	John	1	23	He said , I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make straight the way of the Lord , as said the prophet Esaias .
KJV	John	1	24	And they which were sent were of the Pharisees .
KJV	John	1	25	And they asked him , and said unto him , Why baptizest thou then , if thou be not that Christ , nor Elias , neither that prophet ?
KJV	John	1	26	John answered them , saying , I baptize with water : but there standeth one among you , whom ye know not ;
KJV	John	1	27	He it is , who coming after me is preferred before me , whose shoe 's latchet I am not worthy to unloose .
KJV	John	1	28	These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan , where John was baptizing .
KJV	John	1	29	The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him , and saith , Behold the Lamb of God , which taketh away the sin of the world .
KJV	John	1	30	This is he of whom I said , After me cometh a man which is preferred before me : for he was before me .
KJV	John	1	31	And I knew him not : but that he should be made manifest to Israel , therefore am I come baptizing with water .
KJV	John	1	32	And John bare record , saying , I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove , and it abode upon him .
KJV	John	1	33	And I knew him not : but he that sent me to baptize with water , the same said unto me , Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending , and remaining on him , the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost .
KJV	John	1	34	And I saw , and bare record that this is the Son of God .
KJV	John	1	35	Again the next day after John stood , and two of his disciples ;
KJV	John	1	36	And looking upon Jesus as he walked , he saith , Behold the Lamb of God !
KJV	John	1	37	And the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed Jesus .
KJV	John	1	38	Then Jesus turned , and saw them following , and saith unto them , What seek ye ? They said unto him , Rabbi , ( which is to say , being interpreted , Master , ) where dwellest thou ?
KJV	John	1	39	He saith unto them , Come and see . They came and saw where he dwelt , and abode with him that day : for it was about the tenth hour .
KJV	John	1	40	One of the two which heard John speak , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother .
KJV	John	1	41	He first findeth his own brother Simon , and saith unto him , We have found the Messias , which is , being interpreted , the Christ .
KJV	John	1	42	And he brought him to Jesus . And when Jesus beheld him , he said , Thou art Simon the son of Jona : thou shalt be called Cephas , which is by interpretation , A stone .
KJV	John	1	43	The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee , and findeth Philip , and saith unto him , Follow me .
KJV	John	1	44	Now Philip was of Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
KJV	John	1	45	Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith unto him , We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , did write , Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph .
KJV	John	1	46	And Nathanael said unto him , Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth ? Philip saith unto him , Come and see .
KJV	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , and saith of him , Behold an Israelite indeed , in whom is no guile !
KJV	John	1	48	Nathanael saith unto him , Whence knowest thou me ? Jesus answered and said unto him , Before that Philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig tree , I saw thee .
KJV	John	1	49	Nathanael answered and saith unto him , Rabbi , thou art the Son of God ; thou art the King of Israel .
KJV	John	1	50	Jesus answered and said unto him , Because I said unto thee , I saw thee under the fig tree , believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these .
KJV	John	1	51	And he saith unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man .
KJV	John	2	2	And both Jesus was called , and his disciples , to the marriage .
KJV	John	2	3	And when they wanted wine , the mother of Jesus saith unto him , They have no wine .
KJV	John	2	4	Jesus saith unto her , Woman , what have I to do with thee ? mine hour is not yet come .
KJV	John	2	5	His mother saith unto the servants , Whatsoever he saith unto you , do it .
KJV	John	2	6	And there were set there six waterpots of stone , after the manner of the purifying of the Jews , containing two or three firkins apiece .
KJV	John	2	7	Jesus saith unto them , Fill the waterpots with water . And they filled them up to the brim .
KJV	John	2	8	And he saith unto them , Draw out now , and bear unto the governor of the feast . And they bare it .
KJV	John	2	9	When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , and knew not whence it was : ( but the servants which drew the water knew ; ) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom ,
KJV	John	2	10	And saith unto him , Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine ; and when men have well drunk , then that which is worse : but thou hast kept the good wine until now .
KJV	John	2	11	This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee , and manifested forth his glory ; and his disciples believed on him .
KJV	John	2	12	After this he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples : and they continued there not many days .
KJV	John	2	13	And the Jews ' passover was at hand , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
KJV	John	2	14	And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves , and the changers of money sitting :
KJV	John	2	15	And when he had made a scourge of small cords , he drove them all out of the temple , and the sheep , and the oxen ; and poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew the tables ;
KJV	John	2	16	And said unto them that sold doves , Take these things hence ; make not my Father 's house an house of merchandise .
KJV	John	2	17	And his disciples remembered that it was written , The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up .
KJV	John	2	18	Then answered the Jews and said unto him , What sign shewest thou unto us , seeing that thou doest these things ?
KJV	John	2	19	Jesus answered and said unto them , Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up .
KJV	John	2	20	Then said the Jews , Forty and six years was this temple in building , and wilt thou rear it up in three days ?
KJV	John	2	21	But he spake of the temple of his body .
KJV	John	2	22	When therefore he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them ; and they believed the scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
KJV	John	2	23	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the miracles which he did .
KJV	John	2	24	But Jesus did not commit himself unto them , because he knew all men ,
KJV	John	2	25	And needed not that any should testify of man : for he knew what was in man .
KJV	John	3	3	Jesus answered and said unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except a man be born again , he can not see the kingdom of God .
KJV	John	3	2	The same came to Jesus by night , and said unto him , Rabbi , we know that thou art a teacher come from God : for no man can do these miracles that thou doest , except God be with him .
KJV	John	3	4	Nicodemus saith unto him , How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter the second time into his mother 's womb , and be born ?
KJV	John	3	5	Jesus answered , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit , he can not enter into the kingdom of God .
KJV	John	3	6	That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
KJV	John	3	7	Marvel not that I said unto thee , Ye must be born again .
KJV	John	3	8	The wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the Spirit .
KJV	John	3	9	Nicodemus answered and said unto him , How can these things be ?
KJV	John	3	10	Jesus answered and said unto him , Art thou a master of Israel , and knowest not these things ?
KJV	John	3	11	Verily , verily , I say unto thee , We speak that we do know , and testify that we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness .
KJV	John	3	12	If I have told you earthly things , and ye believe not , how shall ye believe , if I tell you of heavenly things ?
KJV	John	3	13	And no man hath ascended up to heaven , but he that came down from heaven , even the Son of man which is in heaven .
KJV	John	3	14	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of man be lifted up :
KJV	John	3	15	That whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have eternal life .
KJV	John	3	16	For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life .
KJV	John	3	17	For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world ; but that the world through him might be saved .
KJV	John	3	18	He that believeth on him is not condemned : but he that believeth not is condemned already , because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God .
KJV	John	3	19	And this is the condemnation , that light is come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds were evil .
KJV	John	3	20	For every one that doeth evil hateth the light , neither cometh to the light , lest his deeds should be reproved .
KJV	John	3	21	But he that doeth truth cometh to the light , that his deeds may be made manifest , that they are wrought in God .
KJV	John	3	22	After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea ; and there he tarried with them , and baptized .
KJV	John	3	23	And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim , because there was much water there : and they came , and were baptized .
KJV	John	3	24	For John was not yet cast into prison .
KJV	John	3	25	Then there arose a question between some of John 's disciples and the Jews about purifying .
KJV	John	3	26	And they came unto John , and said unto him , Rabbi , he that was with thee beyond Jordan , to whom thou barest witness , behold , the same baptizeth , and all men come to him .
KJV	John	3	27	John answered and said , A man can receive nothing , except it be given him from heaven .
KJV	John	3	28	Ye yourselves bear me witness , that I said , I am not the Christ , but that I am sent before him .
KJV	John	3	29	He that hath the bride is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , which standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom 's voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
KJV	John	3	30	He must increase , but I must decrease .
KJV	John	3	31	He that cometh from above is above all : he that is of the earth is earthly , and speaketh of the earth : he that cometh from heaven is above all .
KJV	John	3	32	And what he hath seen and heard , that he testifieth ; and no man receiveth his testimony .
KJV	John	3	33	He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true .
KJV	John	3	34	For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God : for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him .
KJV	John	3	35	The Father loveth the Son , and hath given all things into his hand .
KJV	John	3	36	He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life : and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life ; but the wrath of God abideth on him .
KJV	John	4	4	And he must needs go through Samaria .
KJV	John	4	2	( Though Jesus himself baptized not , but his disciples , )
KJV	John	4	3	He left Judaea , and departed again into Galilee .
KJV	John	4	5	Then cometh he to a city of Samaria , which is called Sychar , near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
KJV	John	4	6	Now Jacob 's well was there . Jesus therefore , being wearied with his journey , sat thus on the well : and it was about the sixth hour .
KJV	John	4	7	There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water : Jesus saith unto her , Give me to drink .
KJV	John	4	8	( For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat . )
KJV	John	4	9	Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him , How is it that thou , being a Jew , askest drink of me , which am a woman of Samaria ? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans .
KJV	John	4	10	Jesus answered and said unto her , If thou knewest the gift of God , and who it is that saith to thee , Give me to drink ; thou wouldest have asked of him , and he would have given thee living water .
KJV	John	4	11	The woman saith unto him , Sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep : from whence then hast thou that living water ?
KJV	John	4	12	Art thou greater than our father Jacob , which gave us the well , and drank thereof himself , and his children , and his cattle ?
KJV	John	4	13	Jesus answered and said unto her , Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again :
KJV	John	4	14	But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst ; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life .
KJV	John	4	15	The woman saith unto him , Sir , give me this water , that I thirst not , neither come hither to draw .
KJV	John	4	16	Jesus saith unto her , Go , call thy husband , and come hither .
KJV	John	4	17	The woman answered and said , I have no husband . Jesus said unto her , Thou hast well said , I have no husband :
KJV	John	4	18	For thou hast had five husbands ; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband : in that saidst thou truly .
KJV	John	4	19	The woman saith unto him , Sir , I perceive that thou art a prophet .
KJV	John	4	20	Our fathers worshipped in this mountain ; and ye say , that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship .
KJV	John	4	21	Jesus saith unto her , Woman , believe me , the hour cometh , when ye shall neither in this mountain , nor yet at Jerusalem , worship the Father .
KJV	John	4	22	Ye worship ye know not what : we know what we worship : for salvation is of the Jews .
KJV	John	4	23	But the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth : for the Father seeketh such to worship him .
KJV	John	4	24	God is a Spirit : and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth .
KJV	John	4	25	The woman saith unto him , I know that Messias cometh , which is called Christ : when he is come , he will tell us all things .
KJV	John	4	26	Jesus saith unto her , I that speak unto thee am he .
KJV	John	4	27	And upon this came his disciples , and marvelled that he talked with the woman : yet no man said , What seekest thou ? or , Why talkest thou with her ?
KJV	John	4	28	The woman then left her waterpot , and went her way into the city , and saith to the men ,
KJV	John	4	29	Come , see a man , which told me all things that ever I did : is not this the Christ ?
KJV	John	4	30	Then they went out of the city , and came unto him .
KJV	John	4	31	In the mean while his disciples prayed him , saying , Master , eat .
KJV	John	4	32	But he said unto them , I have meat to eat that ye know not of .
KJV	John	4	33	Therefore said the disciples one to another , Hath any man brought him ought to eat ?
KJV	John	4	34	Jesus saith unto them , My meat is to do the will of him that sent me , and to finish his work .
KJV	John	4	35	Say not ye , There are yet four months , and then cometh harvest ? behold , I say unto you , Lift up your eyes , and look on the fields ; for they are white already to harvest .
KJV	John	4	36	And he that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life eternal : that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together .
KJV	John	4	37	And herein is that saying true , One soweth , and another reapeth .
KJV	John	4	38	I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour : other men laboured , and ye are entered into their labours .
KJV	John	4	39	And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman , which testified , He told me all that ever I did .
KJV	John	4	40	So when the Samaritans were come unto him , they besought him that he would tarry with them : and he abode there two days .
KJV	John	4	41	And many more believed because of his own word ;
KJV	John	4	42	And said unto the woman , Now we believe , not because of thy saying : for we have heard him ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Saviour of the world .
KJV	John	4	43	Now after two days he departed thence , and went into Galilee .
KJV	John	4	44	For Jesus himself testified , that a prophet hath no honour in his own country .
KJV	John	4	45	Then when he was come into Galilee , the Galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast .
KJV	John	4	46	So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . And there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at Capernaum .
KJV	John	4	47	When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee , he went unto him , and besought him that he would come down , and heal his son : for he was at the point of death .
KJV	John	4	48	Then said Jesus unto him , Except ye see signs and wonders , ye will not believe .
KJV	John	4	49	The nobleman saith unto him , Sir , come down ere my child die .
KJV	John	4	50	Jesus saith unto him , Go thy way ; thy son liveth . And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way .
KJV	John	4	51	And as he was now going down , his servants met him , and told him , saying , Thy son liveth .
KJV	John	4	52	Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend . And they said unto him , Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him .
KJV	John	4	53	So the father knew that it was at the same hour , in the which Jesus said unto him , Thy son liveth : and himself believed , and his whole house .
KJV	John	4	54	This is again the second miracle that Jesus did , when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee .
KJV	John	5	5	And a certain man was there , which had an infirmity thirty and eight years .
KJV	John	5	2	Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool , which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda , having five porches .
KJV	John	5	3	In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk , of blind , halt , withered , waiting for the moving of the water .
KJV	John	5	4	For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool , and troubled the water : whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had .
KJV	John	5	6	When Jesus saw him lie , and knew that he had been now a long time in that case , he saith unto him , Wilt thou be made whole ?
KJV	John	5	7	The impotent man answered him , Sir , I have no man , when the water is troubled , to put me into the pool : but while I am coming , another steppeth down before me .
KJV	John	5	8	Jesus saith unto him , Rise , take up thy bed , and walk .
KJV	John	5	9	And immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sabbath .
KJV	John	5	10	The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured , It is the sabbath day : it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed .
KJV	John	5	11	He answered them , He that made me whole , the same said unto me , Take up thy bed , and walk .
KJV	John	5	12	Then asked they him , What man is that which said unto thee , Take up thy bed , and walk ?
KJV	John	5	13	And he that was healed wist not who it was : for Jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in that place .
KJV	John	5	14	Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple , and said unto him , Behold , thou art made whole : sin no more , lest a worse thing come unto thee .
KJV	John	5	15	The man departed , and told the Jews that it was Jesus , which had made him whole .
KJV	John	5	16	And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus , and sought to slay him , because he had done these things on the sabbath day .
KJV	John	5	17	But Jesus answered them , My Father worketh hitherto , and I work .
KJV	John	5	18	Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him , because he not only had broken the sabbath , but said also that God was his Father , making himself equal with God .
KJV	John	5	19	Then answered Jesus and said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he seeth the Father do : for what things soever he doeth , these also doeth the Son likewise .
KJV	John	5	20	For the Father loveth the Son , and sheweth him all things that himself doeth : and he will shew him greater works than these , that ye may marvel .
KJV	John	5	21	For as the Father raiseth up the dead , and quickeneth them ; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will .
KJV	John	5	22	For the Father judgeth no man , but hath committed all judgment unto the Son :
KJV	John	5	23	That all men should honour the Son , even as they honour the Father . He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him .
KJV	John	5	24	Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that heareth my word , and believeth on him that sent me , hath everlasting life , and shall not come into condemnation ; but is passed from death unto life .
KJV	John	5	25	Verily , verily , I say unto you , The hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear shall live .
KJV	John	5	26	For as the Father hath life in himself ; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself ;
KJV	John	5	27	And hath given him authority to execute judgment also , because he is the Son of man .
KJV	John	5	28	Marvel not at this : for the hour is coming , in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice ,
KJV	John	5	29	And shall come forth ; they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of damnation .
KJV	John	5	30	I can of mine own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of the Father which hath sent me .
KJV	John	5	31	If I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true .
KJV	John	5	32	There is another that beareth witness of me ; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true .
KJV	John	5	33	Ye sent unto John , and he bare witness unto the truth .
KJV	John	5	34	But I receive not testimony from man : but these things I say , that ye might be saved .
KJV	John	5	35	He was a burning and a shining light : and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light .
KJV	John	5	36	But I have greater witness than that of John : for the works which the Father hath given me to finish , the same works that I do , bear witness of me , that the Father hath sent me .
KJV	John	5	37	And the Father himself , which hath sent me , hath borne witness of me . Ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape .
KJV	John	5	38	And ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he hath sent , him ye believe not .
KJV	John	5	39	Search the scriptures ; for in them ye think ye have eternal life : and they are they which testify of me .
KJV	John	5	40	And ye will not come to me , that ye might have life .
KJV	John	5	41	I receive not honour from men .
KJV	John	5	42	But I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you .
KJV	John	5	43	I am come in my Father 's name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .
KJV	John	5	44	How can ye believe , which receive honour one of another , and seek not the honour that cometh from God only ?
KJV	John	5	45	Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father : there is one that accuseth you , even Moses , in whom ye trust .
KJV	John	5	46	For had ye believed Moses , ye would have believed me ; for he wrote of me .
KJV	John	5	47	But if ye believe not his writings , how shall ye believe my words ?
KJV	John	6	6	And this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do .
KJV	John	6	2	And a great multitude followed him , because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased .
KJV	John	6	3	And Jesus went up into a mountain , and there he sat with his disciples .
KJV	John	6	4	And the passover , a feast of the Jews , was nigh .
KJV	John	6	5	When Jesus then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come unto him , he saith unto Philip , Whence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ?
KJV	John	6	7	Philip answered him , Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one of them may take a little .
KJV	John	6	8	One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter 's brother , saith unto him ,
KJV	John	6	9	There is a lad here , which hath five barley loaves , and two small fishes : but what are they among so many ?
KJV	John	6	10	And Jesus said , Make the men sit down . Now there was much grass in the place . So the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
KJV	John	6	11	And Jesus took the loaves ; and when he had given thanks , he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to them that were set down ; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would .
KJV	John	6	12	When they were filled , he said unto his disciples , Gather up the fragments that remain , that nothing be lost .
KJV	John	6	13	Therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which remained over and above unto them that had eaten .
KJV	John	6	14	Then those men , when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did , said , This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world .
KJV	John	6	15	When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
KJV	John	6	16	And when even was now come , his disciples went down unto the sea ,
KJV	John	6	17	And entered into a ship , and went over the sea toward Capernaum . And it was now dark , and Jesus was not come to them .
KJV	John	6	18	And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew .
KJV	John	6	19	So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the ship : and they were afraid .
KJV	John	6	20	But he saith unto them , It is I ; be not afraid .
KJV	John	6	21	Then they willingly received him into the ship : and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went .
KJV	John	6	22	The day following , when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there , save that one whereinto his disciples were entered , and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat , but that his disciples were gone away alone ;
KJV	John	6	23	( Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread , after that the Lord had given thanks : )
KJV	John	6	24	When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they also took shipping , and came to Capernaum , seeking for Jesus .
KJV	John	6	25	And when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , Rabbi , when camest thou hither ?
KJV	John	6	26	Jesus answered them and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Ye seek me , not because ye saw the miracles , but because ye did eat of the loaves , and were filled .
KJV	John	6	27	Labour not for the meat which perisheth , but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life , which the Son of man shall give unto you : for him hath God the Father sealed .
KJV	John	6	28	Then said they unto him , What shall we do , that we might work the works of God ?
KJV	John	6	29	Jesus answered and said unto them , This is the work of God , that ye believe on him whom he hath sent .
KJV	John	6	30	They said therefore unto him , What sign shewest thou then , that we may see , and believe thee ? what dost thou work ?
KJV	John	6	31	Our fathers did eat manna in the desert ; as it is written , He gave them bread from heaven to eat .
KJV	John	6	32	Then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Moses gave you not that bread from heaven ; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven .
KJV	John	6	33	For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven , and giveth life unto the world .
KJV	John	6	34	Then said they unto him , Lord , evermore give us this bread .
KJV	John	6	35	And Jesus said unto them , I am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall never hunger ; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst .
KJV	John	6	36	But I said unto you , That ye also have seen me , and believe not .
KJV	John	6	37	All that the Father giveth me shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out .
KJV	John	6	38	For I came down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me .
KJV	John	6	39	And this is the Father 's will which hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
KJV	John	6	40	And this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which seeth the Son , and believeth on him , may have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day .
KJV	John	6	41	The Jews then murmured at him , because he said , I am the bread which came down from heaven .
KJV	John	6	42	And they said , Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how is it then that he saith , I came down from heaven ?
KJV	John	6	43	Jesus therefore answered and said unto them , Murmur not among yourselves .
KJV	John	6	44	No man can come to me , except the Father which hath sent me draw him : and I will raise him up at the last day .
KJV	John	6	45	It is written in the prophets , And they shall be all taught of God . Every man therefore that hath heard , and hath learned of the Father , cometh unto me .
KJV	John	6	46	Not that any man hath seen the Father , save he which is of God , he hath seen the Father .
KJV	John	6	47	Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me hath everlasting life .
KJV	John	6	48	I am that bread of life .
KJV	John	6	49	Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness , and are dead .
KJV	John	6	50	This is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
KJV	John	6	51	I am the living bread which came down from heaven : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : and the bread that I will give is my flesh , which I will give for the life of the world .
KJV	John	6	52	The Jews therefore strove among themselves , saying , How can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
KJV	John	6	53	Then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
KJV	John	6	54	Whoso eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day .
KJV	John	6	55	For my flesh is meat indeed , and my blood is drink indeed .
KJV	John	6	56	He that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , dwelleth in me , and I in him .
KJV	John	6	57	As the living Father hath sent me , and I live by the Father : so he that eateth me , even he shall live by me .
KJV	John	6	58	This is that bread which came down from heaven : not as your fathers did eat manna , and are dead : he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever .
KJV	John	6	59	These things said he in the synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum .
KJV	John	6	60	Many therefore of his disciples , when they had heard this , said , This is an hard saying ; who can hear it ?
KJV	John	6	61	When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it , he said unto them , Doth this offend you ?
KJV	John	6	62	What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before ?
KJV	John	6	63	It is the spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that I speak unto you , they are spirit , and they are life .
KJV	John	6	64	But there are some of you that believe not . For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not , and who should betray him .
KJV	John	6	65	And he said , Therefore said I unto you , that no man can come unto me , except it were given unto him of my Father .
KJV	John	6	66	From that time many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him .
KJV	John	6	67	Then said Jesus unto the twelve , Will ye also go away ?
KJV	John	6	68	Then Simon Peter answered him , Lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life .
KJV	John	6	69	And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ , the Son of the living God .
KJV	John	6	70	Jesus answered them , Have not I chosen you twelve , and one of you is a devil ?
KJV	John	6	71	He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon : for he it was that should betray him , being one of the twelve .
KJV	John	7	7	The world can not hate you ; but me it hateth , because I testify of it , that the works thereof are evil .
KJV	John	7	2	Now the Jew 's feast of tabernacles was at hand .
KJV	John	7	3	His brethren therefore said unto him , Depart hence , and go into Judaea , that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest .
KJV	John	7	4	For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret , and he himself seeketh to be known openly . If thou do these things , shew thyself to the world .
KJV	John	7	5	For neither did his brethren believe in him .
KJV	John	7	6	Then Jesus said unto them , My time is not yet come : but your time is alway ready .
KJV	John	7	8	Go ye up unto this feast : I go not up yet unto this feast : for my time is not yet full come .
KJV	John	7	9	When he had said these words unto them , he abode still in Galilee .
KJV	John	7	10	But when his brethren were gone up , then went he also up unto the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
KJV	John	7	11	Then the Jews sought him at the feast , and said , Where is he ?
KJV	John	7	12	And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him : for some said , He is a good man : others said , Nay ; but he deceiveth the people .
KJV	John	7	13	Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews .
KJV	John	7	14	Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple , and taught .
KJV	John	7	15	And the Jews marvelled , saying , How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ?
KJV	John	7	16	Jesus answered them , and said , My doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me .
KJV	John	7	17	If any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself .
KJV	John	7	18	He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
KJV	John	7	19	Did not Moses give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law ? Why go ye about to kill me ?
KJV	John	7	20	The people answered and said , Thou hast a devil : who goeth about to kill thee ?
KJV	John	7	21	Jesus answered and said unto them , I have done one work , and ye all marvel .
KJV	John	7	22	Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision ; ( not because it is of Moses , but of the fathers ; ) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man .
KJV	John	7	23	If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ?
KJV	John	7	24	Judge not according to the appearance , but judge righteous judgment .
KJV	John	7	25	Then said some of them of Jerusalem , Is not this he , whom they seek to kill ?
KJV	John	7	26	But , lo , he speaketh boldly , and they say nothing unto him . Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ ?
KJV	John	7	27	Howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when Christ cometh , no man knoweth whence he is .
KJV	John	7	28	Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , Ye both know me , and ye know whence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not .
KJV	John	7	29	But I know him : for I am from him , and he hath sent me .
KJV	John	7	30	Then they sought to take him : but no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come .
KJV	John	7	31	And many of the people believed on him , and said , When Christ cometh , will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done ?
KJV	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him ; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him .
KJV	John	7	33	Then said Jesus unto them , Yet a little while am I with you , and then I go unto him that sent me .
KJV	John	7	34	Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither ye can not come .
KJV	John	7	35	Then said the Jews among themselves , Whither will he go , that we shall not find him ? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles , and teach the Gentiles ?
KJV	John	7	36	What manner of saying is this that he said , Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither ye can not come ?
KJV	John	7	37	In the last day , that great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried , saying , If any man thirst , let him come unto me , and drink .
KJV	John	7	38	He that believeth on me , as the scripture hath said , out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water .
KJV	John	7	39	( But this spake he of the Spirit , which they that believe on him should receive : for the Holy Ghost was not yet given ; because that Jesus was not yet glorified . )
KJV	John	7	40	Many of the people therefore , when they heard this saying , said , Of a truth this is the Prophet .
KJV	John	7	41	Others said , This is the Christ . But some said , Shall Christ come out of Galilee ?
KJV	John	7	42	Hath not the scripture said , That Christ cometh of the seed of David , and out of the town of Bethlehem , where David was ?
KJV	John	7	43	So there was a division among the people because of him .
KJV	John	7	44	And some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him .
KJV	John	7	45	Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees ; and they said unto them , Why have ye not brought him ?
KJV	John	7	46	The officers answered , Never man spake like this man .
KJV	John	7	47	Then answered them the Pharisees , Are ye also deceived ?
KJV	John	7	48	Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him ?
KJV	John	7	49	But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed .
KJV	John	7	50	Nicodemus saith unto them , ( he that came to Jesus by night , being one of them , )
KJV	John	7	51	Doth our law judge any man , before it hear him , and know what he doeth ?
KJV	John	7	52	They answered and said unto him , Art thou also of Galilee ? Search , and look : for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet .
KJV	John	7	53	And every man went unto his own house .
KJV	John	8	8	And again he stooped down , and wrote on the ground .
KJV	John	8	2	And early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them .
KJV	John	8	3	And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery ; and when they had set her in the midst ,
KJV	John	8	4	They say unto him , Master , this woman was taken in adultery , in the very act .
KJV	John	8	5	Now Moses in the law commanded us , that such should be stoned : but what sayest thou ?
KJV	John	8	6	This they said , tempting him , that they might have to accuse him . But Jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground , as though he heard them not .
KJV	John	8	7	So when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said unto them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her .
KJV	John	8	9	And they which heard it , being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one , beginning at the eldest , even unto the last : and Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
KJV	John	8	10	When Jesus had lifted up himself , and saw none but the woman , he said unto her , Woman , where are those thine accusers ? hath no man condemned thee ?
KJV	John	8	11	She said , No man , Lord . And Jesus said unto her , Neither do I condemn thee : go , and sin no more .
KJV	John	8	12	Then spake Jesus again unto them , saying , I am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life .
KJV	John	8	13	The Pharisees therefore said unto him , Thou bearest record of thyself ; thy record is not true .
KJV	John	8	14	Jesus answered and said unto them , Though I bear record of myself , yet my record is true : for I know whence I came , and whither I go ; but ye can not tell whence I come , and whither I go .
KJV	John	8	15	Ye judge after the flesh ; I judge no man .
KJV	John	8	16	And yet if I judge , my judgment is true : for I am not alone , but I and the Father that sent me .
KJV	John	8	17	It is also written in your law , that the testimony of two men is true .
KJV	John	8	18	I am one that bear witness of myself , and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me .
KJV	John	8	19	Then said they unto him , Where is thy Father ? Jesus answered , Ye neither know me , nor my Father : if ye had known me , ye should have known my Father also .
KJV	John	8	20	These words spake Jesus in the treasury , as he taught in the temple : and no man laid hands on him ; for his hour was not yet come .
KJV	John	8	21	Then said Jesus again unto them , I go my way , and ye shall seek me , and shall die in your sins : whither I go , ye can not come .
KJV	John	8	22	Then said the Jews , Will he kill himself ? because he saith , Whither I go , ye can not come .
KJV	John	8	23	And he said unto them , Ye are from beneath ; I am from above : ye are of this world ; I am not of this world .
KJV	John	8	24	I said therefore unto you , that ye shall die in your sins : for if ye believe not that I am he , ye shall die in your sins .
KJV	John	8	25	Then said they unto him , Who art thou ? And Jesus saith unto them , Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning .
KJV	John	8	26	I have many things to say and to judge of you : but he that sent me is true ; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him .
KJV	John	8	27	They understood not that he spake to them of the Father .
KJV	John	8	28	Then said Jesus unto them , When ye have lifted up the Son of man , then shall ye know that I am he , and that I do nothing of myself ; but as my Father hath taught me , I speak these things .
KJV	John	8	29	And he that sent me is with me : the Father hath not left me alone ; for I do always those things that please him .
KJV	John	8	30	As he spake these words , many believed on him .
KJV	John	8	31	Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him , If ye continue in my word , then are ye my disciples indeed ;
KJV	John	8	32	And ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free .
KJV	John	8	33	They answered him , We be Abraham 's seed , and were never in bondage to any man : how sayest thou , Ye shall be made free ?
KJV	John	8	34	Jesus answered them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin .
KJV	John	8	35	And the servant abideth not in the house for ever : but the Son abideth ever .
KJV	John	8	36	If the Son therefore shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed .
KJV	John	8	37	I know that ye are Abraham 's seed ; but ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you .
KJV	John	8	38	I speak that which I have seen with my Father : and ye do that which ye have seen with your father .
KJV	John	8	39	They answered and said unto him , Abraham is our father . Jesus saith unto them , If ye were Abraham 's children , ye would do the works of Abraham .
KJV	John	8	40	But now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which I have heard of God : this did not Abraham .
KJV	John	8	41	Ye do the deeds of your father . Then said they to him , We be not born of fornication ; we have one Father , even God .
KJV	John	8	42	Jesus said unto them , If God were your Father , ye would love me : for I proceeded forth and came from God ; neither came I of myself , but he sent me .
KJV	John	8	43	Why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye can not hear my word .
KJV	John	8	44	Ye are of your father the devil , and the lusts of your father ye will do . He was a murderer from the beginning , and abode not in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar , and the father of it .
KJV	John	8	45	And because I tell you the truth , ye believe me not .
KJV	John	8	46	Which of you convinceth me of sin ? And if I say the truth , why do ye not believe me ?
KJV	John	8	47	He that is of God heareth God 's words : ye therefore hear them not , because ye are not of God .
KJV	John	8	48	Then answered the Jews , and said unto him , Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan , and hast a devil ?
KJV	John	8	49	Jesus answered , I have not a devil ; but I honour my Father , and ye do dishonour me .
KJV	John	8	50	And I seek not mine own glory : there is one that seeketh and judgeth .
KJV	John	8	51	Verily , verily , I say unto you , If a man keep my saying , he shall never see death .
KJV	John	8	52	Then said the Jews unto him , Now we know that thou hast a devil . Abraham is dead , and the prophets ; and thou sayest , If a man keep my saying , he shall never taste of death .
KJV	John	8	53	Art thou greater than our father Abraham , which is dead ? and the prophets are dead : whom makest thou thyself ?
KJV	John	8	54	Jesus answered , If I honour myself , my honour is nothing : it is my Father that honoureth me ; of whom ye say , that he is your God :
KJV	John	8	55	Yet ye have not known him ; but I know him : and if I should say , I know him not , I shall be a liar like unto you : but I know him , and keep his saying .
KJV	John	8	56	Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day : and he saw it , and was glad .
KJV	John	8	57	Then said the Jews unto him , Thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen Abraham ?
KJV	John	8	58	Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Before Abraham was , I am .
KJV	John	8	59	Then took they up stones to cast at him : but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by .
KJV	John	9	9	Some said , This is he : others said , He is like him : but he said , I am he .
KJV	John	9	2	And his disciples asked him , saying , Master , who did sin , this man , or his parents , that he was born blind ?
KJV	John	9	3	Jesus answered , Neither hath this man sinned , nor his parents : but that the works of God should be made manifest in him .
KJV	John	9	4	I must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work .
KJV	John	9	5	As long as I am in the world , I am the light of the world .
KJV	John	9	6	When he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay ,
KJV	John	9	7	And said unto him , Go , wash in the pool of Siloam , ( which is by interpretation , Sent . ) He went his way therefore , and washed , and came seeing .
KJV	John	9	8	The neighbours therefore , and they which before had seen him that he was blind , said , Is not this he that sat and begged ?
KJV	John	9	10	Therefore said they unto him , How were thine eyes opened ?
KJV	John	9	11	He answered and said , A man that is called Jesus made clay , and anointed mine eyes , and said unto me , Go to the pool of Siloam , and wash : and I went and washed , and I received sight .
KJV	John	9	12	Then said they unto him , Where is he ? He said , I know not .
KJV	John	9	13	They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind .
KJV	John	9	14	And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes .
KJV	John	9	15	Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight . He said unto them , He put clay upon mine eyes , and I washed , and do see .
KJV	John	9	16	Therefore said some of the Pharisees , This man is not of God , because he keepeth not the sabbath day . Others said , How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles ? And there was a division among them .
KJV	John	9	17	They say unto the blind man again , What sayest thou of him , that he hath opened thine eyes ? He said , He is a prophet .
KJV	John	9	18	But the Jews did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight .
KJV	John	9	19	And they asked them , saying , Is this your son , who ye say was born blind ? how then doth he now see ?
KJV	John	9	20	His parents answered them and said , We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind :
KJV	John	9	21	But by what means he now seeth , we know not ; or who hath opened his eyes , we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself .
KJV	John	9	22	These words spake his parents , because they feared the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man did confess that he was Christ , he should be put out of the synagogue .
KJV	John	9	23	Therefore said his parents , He is of age ; ask him .
KJV	John	9	24	Then again called they the man that was blind , and said unto him , Give God the praise : we know that this man is a sinner .
KJV	John	9	25	He answered and said , Whether he be a sinner or no , I know not : one thing I know , that , whereas I was blind , now I see .
KJV	John	9	26	Then said they to him again , What did he to thee ? how opened he thine eyes ?
KJV	John	9	27	He answered them , I have told you already , and ye did not hear : wherefore would ye hear it again ? will ye also be his disciples ?
KJV	John	9	28	Then they reviled him , and said , Thou art his disciple ; but we are Moses ' disciples .
KJV	John	9	29	We know that God spake unto Moses : as for this fellow , we know not from whence he is .
KJV	John	9	30	The man answered and said unto them , Why herein is a marvellous thing , that ye know not from whence he is , and yet he hath opened mine eyes .
KJV	John	9	31	Now we know that God heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of God , and doeth his will , him he heareth .
KJV	John	9	32	Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind .
KJV	John	9	33	If this man were not of God , he could do nothing .
KJV	John	9	34	They answered and said unto him , Thou wast altogether born in sins , and dost thou teach us ? And they cast him out .
KJV	John	9	35	Jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and when he had found him , he said unto him , Dost thou believe on the Son of God ?
KJV	John	9	36	He answered and said , Who is he , Lord , that I might believe on him ?
KJV	John	9	37	And Jesus said unto him , Thou hast both seen him , and it is he that talketh with thee .
KJV	John	9	38	And he said , Lord , I believe . And he worshipped him .
KJV	John	9	39	And Jesus said , For judgment I am come into this world , that they which see not might see ; and that they which see might be made blind .
KJV	John	9	40	And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words , and said unto him , Are we blind also ?
KJV	John	9	41	Jesus said unto them , If ye were blind , ye should have no sin : but now ye say , We see ; therefore your sin remaineth .
KJV	John	10	10	The thief cometh not , but for to steal , and to kill , and to destroy : I am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more abundantly .
KJV	John	10	2	But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
KJV	John	10	3	To him the porter openeth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out .
KJV	John	10	4	And when he putteth forth his own sheep , he goeth before them , and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice .
KJV	John	10	5	And a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers .
KJV	John	10	6	This parable spake Jesus unto them : but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them .
KJV	John	10	7	Then said Jesus unto them again , Verily , verily , I say unto you , I am the door of the sheep .
KJV	John	10	8	All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them .
KJV	John	10	9	I am the door : by me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall go in and out , and find pasture .
KJV	John	10	11	I am the good shepherd : the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep .
KJV	John	10	12	But he that is an hireling , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth : and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep .
KJV	John	10	13	The hireling fleeth , because he is an hireling , and careth not for the sheep .
KJV	John	10	14	I am the good shepherd , and know my sheep , and am known of mine .
KJV	John	10	15	As the Father knoweth me , even so know I the Father : and I lay down my life for the sheep .
KJV	John	10	16	And other sheep I have , which are not of this fold : them also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one fold , and one shepherd .
KJV	John	10	17	Therefore doth my Father love me , because I lay down my life , that I might take it again .
KJV	John	10	18	No man taketh it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . This commandment have I received of my Father .
KJV	John	10	19	There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings .
KJV	John	10	20	And many of them said , He hath a devil , and is mad ; why hear ye him ?
KJV	John	10	21	Others said , These are not the words of him that hath a devil . Can a devil open the eyes of the blind ?
KJV	John	10	22	And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication , and it was winter .
KJV	John	10	23	And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon 's porch .
KJV	John	10	24	Then came the Jews round about him , and said unto him , How long dost thou make us to doubt ? If thou be the Christ , tell us plainly .
KJV	John	10	25	Jesus answered them , I told you , and ye believed not : the works that I do in my Father 's name , they bear witness of me .
KJV	John	10	26	But ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep , as I said unto you .
KJV	John	10	27	My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me :
KJV	John	10	28	And I give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand .
KJV	John	10	29	My Father , which gave them me , is greater than all ; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father 's hand .
KJV	John	10	30	I and my Father are one .
KJV	John	10	31	Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him .
KJV	John	10	32	Jesus answered them , Many good works have I shewed you from my Father ; for which of those works do ye stone me ?
KJV	John	10	33	The Jews answered him , saying , For a good work we stone thee not ; but for blasphemy ; and because that thou , being a man , makest thyself God .
KJV	John	10	34	Jesus answered them , Is it not written in your law , I said , Ye are gods ?
KJV	John	10	35	If he called them gods , unto whom the word of God came , and the scripture can not be broken ;
KJV	John	10	36	Say ye of him , whom the Father hath sanctified , and sent into the world , Thou blasphemest ; because I said , I am the Son of God ?
KJV	John	10	37	If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not .
KJV	John	10	38	But if I do , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know , and believe , that the Father is in me , and I in him .
KJV	John	10	39	Therefore they sought again to take him : but he escaped out of their hand ,
KJV	John	10	40	And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized ; and there he abode .
KJV	John	10	41	And many resorted unto him , and said , John did no miracle : but all things that John spake of this man were true .
KJV	John	10	42	And many believed on him there .
KJV	John	11	11	These things said he : and after that he saith unto them , Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ; but I go , that I may awake him out of sleep .
KJV	John	11	2	( It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick . )
KJV	John	11	3	Therefore his sisters sent unto him , saying , Lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick .
KJV	John	11	4	When Jesus heard that , he said , This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God might be glorified thereby .
KJV	John	11	5	Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus .
KJV	John	11	6	When he had heard therefore that he was sick , he abode two days still in the same place where he was .
KJV	John	11	7	Then after that saith he to his disciples , Let us go into Judaea again .
KJV	John	11	8	His disciples say unto him , Master , the Jews of late sought to stone thee ; and goest thou thither again ?
KJV	John	11	9	Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If any man walk in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world .
KJV	John	11	10	But if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because there is no light in him .
KJV	John	11	12	Then said his disciples , Lord , if he sleep , he shall do well .
KJV	John	11	13	Howbeit Jesus spake of his death : but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep .
KJV	John	11	14	Then said Jesus unto them plainly , Lazarus is dead .
KJV	John	11	15	And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him .
KJV	John	11	16	Then said Thomas , which is called Didymus , unto his fellowdisciples , Let us also go , that we may die with him .
KJV	John	11	17	Then when Jesus came , he found that he had lain in the grave four days already .
KJV	John	11	18	Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off :
KJV	John	11	19	And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary , to comfort them concerning their brother .
KJV	John	11	20	Then Martha , as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met him : but Mary sat still in the house .
KJV	John	11	21	Then said Martha unto Jesus , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
KJV	John	11	22	But I know , that even now , whatsoever thou wilt ask of God , God will give it thee .
KJV	John	11	23	Jesus saith unto her , Thy brother shall rise again .
KJV	John	11	24	Martha saith unto him , I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day .
KJV	John	11	25	Jesus said unto her , I am the resurrection , and the life : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live :
KJV	John	11	26	And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die . Believest thou this ?
KJV	John	11	27	She saith unto him , Yea , Lord : I believe that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , which should come into the world .
KJV	John	11	28	And when she had so said , she went her way , and called Mary her sister secretly , saying , The Master is come , and calleth for thee .
KJV	John	11	29	As soon as she heard that , she arose quickly , and came unto him .
KJV	John	11	30	Now Jesus was not yet come into the town , but was in that place where Martha met him .
KJV	John	11	31	The Jews then which were with her in the house , and comforted her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up hastily and went out , followed her , saying , She goeth unto the grave to weep there .
KJV	John	11	32	Then when Mary was come where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying unto him , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
KJV	John	11	33	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews also weeping which came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled .
KJV	John	11	34	And said , Where have ye laid him ? They said unto him , Lord , come and see .
KJV	John	11	35	Jesus wept .
KJV	John	11	36	Then said the Jews , Behold how he loved him !
KJV	John	11	37	And some of them said , Could not this man , which opened the eyes of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ?
KJV	John	11	38	Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave . It was a cave , and a stone lay upon it .
KJV	John	11	39	Jesus said , Take ye away the stone . Martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith unto him , Lord , by this time he stinketh : for he hath been dead four days .
KJV	John	11	40	Jesus saith unto her , Said I not unto thee , that , if thou wouldest believe , thou shouldest see the glory of God ?
KJV	John	11	41	Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . And Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , Father , I thank thee that thou hast heard me .
KJV	John	11	42	And I knew that thou hearest me always : but because of the people which stand by I said it , that they may believe that thou hast sent me .
KJV	John	11	43	And when he thus had spoken , he cried with a loud voice , Lazarus , come forth .
KJV	John	11	44	And he that was dead came forth , bound hand and foot with graveclothes : and his face was bound about with a napkin . Jesus saith unto them , Loose him , and let him go .
KJV	John	11	45	Then many of the Jews which came to Mary , and had seen the things which Jesus did , believed on him .
KJV	John	11	46	But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees , and told them what things Jesus had done .
KJV	John	11	47	Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council , and said , What do we ? for this man doeth many miracles .
KJV	John	11	48	If we let him thus alone , all men will believe on him : and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation .
KJV	John	11	49	And one of them , named Caiaphas , being the high priest that same year , said unto them , Ye know nothing at all ,
KJV	John	11	50	Nor consider that it is expedient for us , that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not .
KJV	John	11	51	And this spake he not of himself : but being high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation ;
KJV	John	11	52	And not for that nation only , but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad .
KJV	John	11	53	Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death .
KJV	John	11	54	Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews ; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness , into a city called Ephraim , and there continued with his disciples .
KJV	John	11	55	And the Jews ' passover was nigh at hand : and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover , to purify themselves .
KJV	John	11	56	Then sought they for Jesus , and spake among themselves , as they stood in the temple , What think ye , that he will not come to the feast ?
KJV	John	11	57	Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should shew it , that they might take him .
KJV	John	12	12	On the next day much people that were come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
KJV	John	12	2	There they made him a supper ; and Martha served : but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him .
KJV	John	12	3	Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
KJV	John	12	4	Then saith one of his disciples , Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , which should betray him ,
KJV	John	12	5	Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence , and given to the poor ?
KJV	John	12	6	This he said , not that he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and bare what was put therein .
KJV	John	12	7	Then said Jesus , Let her alone : against the day of my burying hath she kept this .
KJV	John	12	8	For the poor always ye have with you ; but me ye have not always .
KJV	John	12	9	Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
KJV	John	12	10	But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death ;
KJV	John	12	11	Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away , and believed on Jesus .
KJV	John	12	13	Took branches of palm trees , and went forth to meet him , and cried , Hosanna : Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord .
KJV	John	12	14	And Jesus , when he had found a young ass , sat thereon ; as it is written ,
KJV	John	12	15	Fear not , daughter of Sion : behold , thy King cometh , sitting on an ass 's colt .
KJV	John	12	16	These things understood not his disciples at the first : but when Jesus was glorified , then remembered they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him .
KJV	John	12	17	The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , bare record .
KJV	John	12	18	For this cause the people also met him , for that they heard that he had done this miracle .
KJV	John	12	19	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves , Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ? behold , the world is gone after him .
KJV	John	12	20	And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast :
KJV	John	12	21	The same came therefore to Philip , which was of Bethsaida of Galilee , and desired him , saying , Sir , we would see Jesus .
KJV	John	12	22	Philip cometh and telleth Andrew : and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus .
KJV	John	12	23	And Jesus answered them , saying , The hour is come , that the Son of man should be glorified .
KJV	John	12	24	Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
KJV	John	12	25	He that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal .
KJV	John	12	26	If any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will my Father honour .
KJV	John	12	27	Now is my soul troubled ; and what shall I say ? Father , save me from this hour : but for this cause came I unto this hour .
KJV	John	12	28	Father , glorify thy name . Then came there a voice from heaven , saying , I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again .
KJV	John	12	29	The people therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it thundered : others said , An angel spake to him .
KJV	John	12	30	Jesus answered and said , This voice came not because of me , but for your sakes .
KJV	John	12	31	Now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
KJV	John	12	32	And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto me .
KJV	John	12	33	This he said , signifying what death he should die .
KJV	John	12	34	The people answered him , We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever : and how sayest thou , The Son of man must be lifted up ? who is this Son of man ?
KJV	John	12	35	Then Jesus said unto them , Yet a little while is the light with you . Walk while ye have the light , lest darkness come upon you : for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth .
KJV	John	12	36	While ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . These things spake Jesus , and departed , and did hide himself from them .
KJV	John	12	37	But though he had done so many miracles before them , yet they believed not on him :
KJV	John	12	38	That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spake , Lord , who hath believed our report ? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed ?
KJV	John	12	39	Therefore they could not believe , because that Esaias said again ,
KJV	John	12	40	He hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart ; that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and be converted , and I should heal them .
KJV	John	12	41	These things said Esaias , when he saw his glory , and spake of him .
KJV	John	12	42	Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue :
KJV	John	12	43	For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God .
KJV	John	12	44	Jesus cried and said , He that believeth on me , believeth not on me , but on him that sent me .
KJV	John	12	45	And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me .
KJV	John	12	46	I am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness .
KJV	John	12	47	And if any man hear my words , and believe not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
KJV	John	12	48	He that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
KJV	John	12	49	For I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
KJV	John	12	50	And I know that his commandment is life everlasting : whatsoever I speak therefore , even as the Father said unto me , so I speak .
KJV	John	13	13	Ye call me Master and Lord : and ye say well ; for so I am .
KJV	John	13	2	And supper being ended , the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon 's son , to betray him ;
KJV	John	13	3	Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he was come from God , and went to God ;
KJV	John	13	4	He riseth from supper , and laid aside his garments ; and took a towel , and girded himself .
KJV	John	13	5	After that he poureth water into a bason , and began to wash the disciples ' feet , and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded .
KJV	John	13	6	Then cometh he to Simon Peter : and Peter saith unto him , Lord , dost thou wash my feet ?
KJV	John	13	7	Jesus answered and said unto him , What I do thou knowest not now ; but thou shalt know hereafter .
KJV	John	13	8	Peter saith unto him , Thou shalt never wash my feet . Jesus answered him , If I wash thee not , thou hast no part with me .
KJV	John	13	9	Simon Peter saith unto him , Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head .
KJV	John	13	10	Jesus saith to him , He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet , but is clean every whit : and ye are clean , but not all .
KJV	John	13	11	For he knew who should betray him ; therefore said he , Ye are not all clean .
KJV	John	13	12	So after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was set down again , he said unto them , Know ye what I have done to you ?
KJV	John	13	14	If I then , your Lord and Master , have washed your feet ; ye also ought to wash one another 's feet .
KJV	John	13	15	For I have given you an example , that ye should do as I have done to you .
KJV	John	13	16	Verily , verily , I say unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him .
KJV	John	13	17	If ye know these things , happy are ye if ye do them .
KJV	John	13	18	I speak not of you all : I know whom I have chosen : but that the scripture may be fulfilled , He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me .
KJV	John	13	19	Now I tell you before it come , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that I am he .
KJV	John	13	20	Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
KJV	John	13	21	When Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
KJV	John	13	22	Then the disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake .
KJV	John	13	23	Now there was leaning on Jesus ' bosom one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved .
KJV	John	13	24	Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake .
KJV	John	13	25	He then lying on Jesus ' breast saith unto him , Lord , who is it ?
KJV	John	13	26	Jesus answered , He it is , to whom I shall give a sop , when I have dipped it . And when he had dipped the sop , he gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon .
KJV	John	13	27	And after the sop Satan entered into him . Then said Jesus unto him , That thou doest , do quickly .
KJV	John	13	28	Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him .
KJV	John	13	29	For some of them thought , because Judas had the bag , that Jesus had said unto him , Buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor .
KJV	John	13	30	He then having received the sop went immediately out : and it was night .
KJV	John	13	31	Therefore , when he was gone out , Jesus said , Now is the Son of man glorified , and God is glorified in him .
KJV	John	13	32	If God be glorified in him , God shall also glorify him in himself , and shall straightway glorify him .
KJV	John	13	33	Little children , yet a little while I am with you . Ye shall seek me : and as I said unto the Jews , Whither I go , ye can not come ; so now I say to you .
KJV	John	13	34	A new commandment I give unto you , That ye love one another ; as I have loved you , that ye also love one another .
KJV	John	13	35	By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another .
KJV	John	13	36	Simon Peter said unto him , Lord , whither goest thou ? Jesus answered him , Whither I go , thou canst not follow me now ; but thou shalt follow me afterwards .
KJV	John	13	37	Peter said unto him , Lord , why can not I follow thee now ? I will lay down my life for thy sake .
KJV	John	13	38	Jesus answered him , Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ? Verily , verily , I say unto thee , The cock shall not crow , till thou hast denied me thrice .
KJV	John	14	14	If ye shall ask any thing in my name , I will do it .
KJV	John	14	2	In my Father 's house are many mansions : if it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you .
KJV	John	14	3	And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and receive you unto myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also .
KJV	John	14	4	And whither I go ye know , and the way ye know .
KJV	John	14	5	Thomas saith unto him , Lord , we know not whither thou goest ; and how can we know the way ?
KJV	John	14	6	Jesus saith unto him , I am the way , the truth , and the life : no man cometh unto the Father , but by me .
KJV	John	14	7	If ye had known me , ye should have known my Father also : and from henceforth ye know him , and have seen him .
KJV	John	14	8	Philip saith unto him , Lord , show us the Father , and it sufficeth us .
KJV	John	14	9	Jesus saith unto him , Have I been so long time with you , and yet hast thou not known me , Philip ? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father ; and how sayest thou then , Show us the Father ?
KJV	John	14	10	Believest thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself : but the Father that dwelleth in me , he doeth the works .
KJV	John	14	11	Believe me that I am in the Father , and the Father in me : or else believe me for the very works ' sake .
KJV	John	14	12	Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go unto my Father .
KJV	John	14	13	And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
KJV	John	14	15	If ye love me , keep my commandments .
KJV	John	14	16	And I will pray the Father , and he shall give you another Comforter , that he may abide with you for ever ;
KJV	John	14	17	Even the Spirit of truth ; whom the world can not receive , because it seeth him not , neither knoweth him : but ye know him ; for he dwelleth with you , and shall be in you .
KJV	John	14	18	I will not leave you comfortless : I will come to you .
KJV	John	14	19	Yet a little while , and the world seeth me no more ; but ye see me : because I live , ye shall live also .
KJV	John	14	20	At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you .
KJV	John	14	21	He that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him .
KJV	John	14	22	Judas saith unto him , not Iscariot , Lord , how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us , and not unto the world ?
KJV	John	14	23	Jesus answered and said unto him , If a man love me , he will keep my words : and my Father will love him , and we will come unto him , and make our abode with him .
KJV	John	14	24	He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the Father 's which sent me .
KJV	John	14	25	These things have I spoken unto you , being yet present with you .
KJV	John	14	26	But the Comforter , which is the Holy Ghost , whom the Father will send in my name , he shall teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , whatsoever I have said unto you .
KJV	John	14	27	Peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you . Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
KJV	John	14	28	Ye have heard how I said unto you , I go away , and come again unto you . If ye loved me , ye would rejoice , because I said , I go unto the Father : for my Father is greater than I .
KJV	John	14	29	And now I have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye might believe .
KJV	John	14	30	Hereafter I will not talk much with you : for the prince of this world cometh , and hath nothing in me .
KJV	John	14	31	But that the world may know that I love the Father ; and as the Father gave me commandment , even so I do . Arise , let us go hence .
KJV	John	15	15	Henceforth I call you not servants ; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth : but I have called you friends ; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you .
KJV	John	15	2	Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away : and every branch that beareth fruit , he purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
KJV	John	15	3	Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you .
KJV	John	15	4	Abide in me , and I in you . As the branch can not bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the vine ; no more can ye , except ye abide in me .
KJV	John	15	5	I am the vine , ye are the branches : He that abideth in me , and I in him , the same bringeth forth much fruit : for without me ye can do nothing .
KJV	John	15	6	If a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
KJV	John	15	7	If ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ye shall ask what ye will , and it shall be done unto you .
KJV	John	15	8	Herein is my Father glorified , that ye bear much fruit ; so shall ye be my disciples .
KJV	John	15	9	As the Father hath loved me , so have I loved you : continue ye in my love .
KJV	John	15	10	If ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as I have kept my Father 's commandments , and abide in his love .
KJV	John	15	11	These things have I spoken unto you , that my joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full .
KJV	John	15	12	This is my commandment , That ye love one another , as I have loved you .
KJV	John	15	13	Greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
KJV	John	15	14	Ye are my friends , if ye do whatsoever I command you .
KJV	John	15	16	Ye have not chosen me , but I have chosen you , and ordained you , that ye should go and bring forth fruit , and that your fruit should remain : that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name , he may give it you .
KJV	John	15	17	These things I command you , that ye love one another .
KJV	John	15	18	If the world hate you , ye know that it hated me before it hated you .
KJV	John	15	19	If ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
KJV	John	15	20	Remember the word that I said unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord . If they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yours also .
KJV	John	15	21	But all these things will they do unto you for my name 's sake , because they know not him that sent me .
KJV	John	15	22	If I had not come and spoken unto them , they had not had sin : but now they have no cloak for their sin .
KJV	John	15	23	He that hateth me hateth my Father also .
KJV	John	15	24	If I had not done among them the works which none other man did , they had not had sin : but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father .
KJV	John	15	25	But this cometh to pass , that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law , They hated me without a cause .
KJV	John	15	26	But when the Comforter is come , whom I will send unto you from the Father , even the Spirit of truth , which proceedeth from the Father , he shall testify of me :
KJV	John	15	27	And ye also shall bear witness , because ye have been with me from the beginning .
KJV	John	16	16	A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me , because I go to the Father .
KJV	John	16	2	They shall put you out of the synagogues : yea , the time cometh , that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service .
KJV	John	16	3	And these things will they do unto you , because they have not known the Father , nor me .
KJV	John	16	4	But these things have I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . And these things I said not unto you at the beginning , because I was with you .
KJV	John	16	5	But now I go my way to him that sent me ; and none of you asketh me , Whither goest thou ?
KJV	John	16	6	But because I have said these things unto you , sorrow hath filled your heart .
KJV	John	16	7	Nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedient for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Comforter will not come unto you ; but if I depart , I will send him unto you .
KJV	John	16	8	And when he is come , he will reprove the world of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment :
KJV	John	16	9	Of sin , because they believe not on me ;
KJV	John	16	10	Of righteousness , because I go to my Father , and ye see me no more ;
KJV	John	16	11	Of judgment , because the prince of this world is judged .
KJV	John	16	12	I have yet many things to say unto you , but ye can not bear them now .
KJV	John	16	13	Howbeit when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will shew you things to come .
KJV	John	16	14	He shall glorify me : for he shall receive of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
KJV	John	16	15	All things that the Father hath are mine : therefore said I , that he shall take of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
KJV	John	16	17	Then said some of his disciples among themselves , What is this that he saith unto us , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me : and , Because I go to the Father ?
KJV	John	16	18	They said therefore , What is this that he saith , A little while ? we can not tell what he saith .
KJV	John	16	19	Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him , and said unto them , Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ?
KJV	John	16	20	Verily , verily , I say unto you , That ye shall weep and lament , but the world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy .
KJV	John	16	21	A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for joy that a man is born into the world .
KJV	John	16	22	And ye now therefore have sorrow : but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no man taketh from you .
KJV	John	16	23	And in that day ye shall ask me nothing . Verily , verily , I say unto you , Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name , he will give it you .
KJV	John	16	24	Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full .
KJV	John	16	25	These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs : but the time cometh , when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs , but I shall shew you plainly of the Father .
KJV	John	16	26	At that day ye shall ask in my name : and I say not unto you , that I will pray the Father for you :
KJV	John	16	27	For the Father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , and have believed that I came out from God .
KJV	John	16	28	I came forth from the Father , and am come into the world : again , I leave the world , and go to the Father .
KJV	John	16	29	His disciples said unto him , Lo , now speakest thou plainly , and speakest no proverb .
KJV	John	16	30	Now are we sure that thou knowest all things , and needest not that any man should ask thee : by this we believe that thou camest forth from God .
KJV	John	16	31	Jesus answered them , Do ye now believe ?
KJV	John	16	32	Behold , the hour cometh , yea , is now come , that ye shall be scattered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
KJV	John	16	33	These things I have spoken unto you , that in me ye might have peace . In the world ye shall have tribulation : but be of good cheer ; I have overcome the world .
KJV	John	17	17	Sanctify them through thy truth : thy word is truth .
KJV	John	17	2	As thou hast given him power over all flesh , that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him .
KJV	John	17	3	And this is life eternal , that they might know thee the only true God , and Jesus Christ , whom thou hast sent .
KJV	John	17	4	I have glorified thee on the earth : I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do .
KJV	John	17	5	And now , O Father , glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was .
KJV	John	17	6	I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world : thine they were , and thou gavest them me ; and they have kept thy word .
KJV	John	17	7	Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee .
KJV	John	17	8	For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me ; and they have received them , and have known surely that I came out from thee , and they have believed that thou didst send me .
KJV	John	17	9	I pray for them : I pray not for the world , but for them which thou hast given me ; for they are thine .
KJV	John	17	10	And all mine are thine , and thine are mine ; and I am glorified in them .
KJV	John	17	11	And now I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me , that they may be one , as we are .
KJV	John	17	12	While I was with them in the world , I kept them in thy name : those that thou gavest me I have kept , and none of them is lost , but the son of perdition ; that the scripture might be fulfilled .
KJV	John	17	13	And now come I to thee ; and these things I speak in the world , that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves .
KJV	John	17	14	I have given them thy word ; and the world hath hated them , because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
KJV	John	17	15	I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil .
KJV	John	17	16	They are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
KJV	John	17	18	As thou hast sent me into the world , even so have I also sent them into the world .
KJV	John	17	19	And for their sakes I sanctify myself , that they also might be sanctified through the truth .
KJV	John	17	20	Neither pray I for these alone , but for them also which shall believe on me through their word ;
KJV	John	17	21	That they all may be one ; as thou , Father , art in me , and I in thee , that they also may be one in us : that the world may believe that thou hast sent me .
KJV	John	17	22	And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them ; that they may be one , even as we are one :
KJV	John	17	23	I in them , and thou in me , that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them , as thou hast loved me .
KJV	John	17	24	Father , I will that they also , whom thou hast given me , be with me where I am ; that they may behold my glory , which thou hast given me : for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world .
KJV	John	17	25	O righteous Father , the world hath not known thee : but I have known thee , and these have known that thou hast sent me .
KJV	John	17	26	And I have declared unto them thy name , and will declare it : that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them , and I in them .
KJV	John	18	18	And the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of coals ; for it was cold : and they warmed themselves : and Peter stood with them , and warmed himself .
KJV	John	18	2	And Judas also , which betrayed him , knew the place : for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples .
KJV	John	18	3	Judas then , having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees , cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons .
KJV	John	18	4	Jesus therefore , knowing all things that should come upon him , went forth , and said unto them , Whom seek ye ?
KJV	John	18	5	They answered him , Jesus of Nazareth . Jesus saith unto them , I am he . And Judas also , which betrayed him , stood with them .
KJV	John	18	6	As soon then as he had said unto them , I am he , they went backward , and fell to the ground .
KJV	John	18	7	Then asked he them again , Whom seek ye ? And they said , Jesus of Nazareth .
KJV	John	18	8	Jesus answered , I have told you that I am he : if therefore ye seek me , let these go their way :
KJV	John	18	9	That the saying might be fulfilled , which he spake , Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none .
KJV	John	18	10	Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it , and smote the high priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear . The servant 's name was Malchus .
KJV	John	18	11	Then said Jesus unto Peter , Put up thy sword into the sheath : the cup which my Father hath given me , shall I not drink it ?
KJV	John	18	12	Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus , and bound him ,
KJV	John	18	13	And led him away to Annas first ; for he was father in law to Caiaphas , which was the high priest that same year .
KJV	John	18	14	Now Caiaphas was he , which gave counsel to the Jews , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
KJV	John	18	15	And Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple : that disciple was known unto the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest .
KJV	John	18	16	But Peter stood at the door without . Then went out that other disciple , which was known unto the high priest , and spake unto her that kept the door , and brought in Peter .
KJV	John	18	17	Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter , Art not thou also one of this man 's disciples ? He saith , I am not .
KJV	John	18	19	The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples , and of his doctrine .
KJV	John	18	20	Jesus answered him , I spake openly to the world ; I ever taught in the synagogue , and in the temple , whither the Jews always resort ; and in secret have I said nothing .
KJV	John	18	21	Why askest thou me ? ask them which heard me , what I have said unto them : behold , they know what I said .
KJV	John	18	22	And when he had thus spoken , one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand , saying , Answerest thou the high priest so ?
KJV	John	18	23	Jesus answered him , If I have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil : but if well , why smitest thou me ?
KJV	John	18	24	Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest .
KJV	John	18	25	And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself . They said therefore unto him , Art not thou also one of his disciples ? He denied it , and said , I am not .
KJV	John	18	26	One of the servants of the high priest , being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off , saith , Did not I see thee in the garden with him ?
KJV	John	18	27	Peter then denied again : and immediately the cock crew .
KJV	John	18	28	Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover .
KJV	John	18	29	Pilate then went out unto them , and said , What accusation bring ye against this man ?
KJV	John	18	30	They answered and said unto him , If he were not a malefactor , we would not have delivered him up unto thee .
KJV	John	18	31	Then said Pilate unto them , Take ye him , and judge him according to your law . The Jews therefore said unto him , It is not lawful for us to put any man to death :
KJV	John	18	32	That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spake , signifying what death he should die .
KJV	John	18	33	Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again , and called Jesus , and said unto him , Art thou the King of the Jews ?
KJV	John	18	34	Jesus answered him , Sayest thou this thing of thyself , or did others tell it thee of me ?
KJV	John	18	35	Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me : what hast thou done ?
KJV	John	18	36	Jesus answered , My kingdom is not of this world : if my kingdom were of this world , then would my servants fight , that I should not be delivered to the Jews : but now is my kingdom not from hence .
KJV	John	18	37	Pilate therefore said unto him , Art thou a king then ? Jesus answered , Thou sayest that I am a king . To this end was I born , and for this cause came I into the world , that I should bear witness unto the truth . Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice .
KJV	John	18	38	Pilate saith unto him , What is truth ? And when he had said this , he went out again unto the Jews , and saith unto them , I find in him no fault at all .
KJV	John	18	39	But ye have a custom , that I should release unto you one at the passover : will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
KJV	John	18	40	Then cried they all again , saying , Not this man , but Barabbas . Now Barabbas was a robber .
KJV	John	19	19	And Pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . And the writing was Jesus Of Nazareth The King Of The Jews .
KJV	John	19	2	And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple robe ,
KJV	John	19	3	And said , Hail , King of the Jews ! and they smote him with their hands .
KJV	John	19	4	Pilate therefore went forth again , and saith unto them , Behold , I bring him forth to you , that ye may know that I find no fault in him .
KJV	John	19	5	Then came Jesus forth , wearing the crown of thorns , and the purple robe . And Pilate saith unto them , Behold the man !
KJV	John	19	6	When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him , they cried out , saying , Crucify him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Take ye him , and crucify him : for I find no fault in him .
KJV	John	19	7	The Jews answered him , We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God .
KJV	John	19	8	When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he was the more afraid ;
KJV	John	19	9	And went again into the judgment hall , and saith unto Jesus , Whence art thou ? But Jesus gave him no answer .
KJV	John	19	10	Then saith Pilate unto him , Speakest thou not unto me ? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee , and have power to release thee ?
KJV	John	19	11	Jesus answered , Thou couldest have no power at all against me , except it were given thee from above : therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin .
KJV	John	19	12	And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him : but the Jews cried out , saying , If thou let this man go , thou art not Caesar 's friend : whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar .
KJV	John	19	13	When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement , but in the Hebrew , Gabbatha .
KJV	John	19	14	And it was the preparation of the passover , and about the sixth hour : and he saith unto the Jews , Behold your King !
KJV	John	19	15	But they cried out , Away with him , away with him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Shall I crucify your King ? The chief priests answered , We have no king but Caesar .
KJV	John	19	16	Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified . And they took Jesus , and led him away .
KJV	John	19	17	And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha :
KJV	John	19	18	Where they crucified him , and two other with him , on either side one , and Jesus in the midst .
KJV	John	19	20	This title then read many of the Jews : for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in Hebrew , and Greek , and Latin .
KJV	John	19	21	Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate , Write not , The King of the Jews ; but that he said , I am King of the Jews .
KJV	John	19	22	Pilate answered , What I have written I have written .
KJV	John	19	23	Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took his garments , and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also his coat : now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout .
KJV	John	19	24	They said therefore among themselves , Let us not rend it , but cast lots for it , whose it shall be : that the scripture might be fulfilled , which saith , They parted my raiment among them , and for my vesture they did cast lots . These things therefore the soldiers did .
KJV	John	19	25	Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene .
KJV	John	19	26	When Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son !
KJV	John	19	27	Then saith he to the disciple , Behold thy mother ! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home .
KJV	John	19	28	After this , Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished , that the scripture might be fulfilled , saith , I thirst .
KJV	John	19	29	Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a spunge with vinegar , and put it upon hyssop , and put it to his mouth .
KJV	John	19	30	When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , It is finished : and he bowed his head , and gave up the ghost .
KJV	John	19	31	The Jews therefore , because it was the preparation , that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day , ( for that sabbath day was an high day , ) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away .
KJV	John	19	32	Then came the soldiers , and brake the legs of the first , and of the other which was crucified with him .
KJV	John	19	33	But when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they brake not his legs :
KJV	John	19	34	But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side , and forthwith came there out blood and water .
KJV	John	19	35	And he that saw it bare record , and his record is true : and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye might believe .
KJV	John	19	36	For these things were done , that the scripture should be fulfilled , A bone of him shall not be broken .
KJV	John	19	37	And again another scripture saith , They shall look on him whom they pierced .
KJV	John	19	38	And after this Joseph of Arimathaea , being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus : and Pilate gave him leave . He came therefore , and took the body of Jesus .
KJV	John	19	39	And there came also Nicodemus , which at the first came to Jesus by night , and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight .
KJV	John	19	40	Then took they the body of Jesus , and wound it in linen clothes with the spices , as the manner of the Jews is to bury .
KJV	John	19	41	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the garden a new sepulchre , wherein was never man yet laid .
KJV	John	19	42	There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews ' preparation day ; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand .
KJV	John	20	20	And when he had so said , he shewed unto them his hands and his side . Then were the disciples glad , when they saw the Lord .
KJV	John	20	2	Then she runneth , and cometh to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple , whom Jesus loved , and saith unto them , They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre , and we know not where they have laid him .
KJV	John	20	3	Peter therefore went forth , and that other disciple , and came to the sepulchre .
KJV	John	20	4	So they ran both together : and the other disciple did outrun Peter , and came first to the sepulchre .
KJV	John	20	5	And he stooping down , and looking in , saw the linen clothes lying ; yet went he not in .
KJV	John	20	6	Then cometh Simon Peter following him , and went into the sepulchre , and seeth the linen clothes lie ,
KJV	John	20	7	And the napkin , that was about his head , not lying with the linen clothes , but wrapped together in a place by itself .
KJV	John	20	8	Then went in also that other disciple , which came first to the sepulchre , and he saw , and believed .
KJV	John	20	9	For as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead .
KJV	John	20	10	Then the disciples went away again unto their own home .
KJV	John	20	11	But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping : and as she wept , she stooped down , and looked into the sepulchre ,
KJV	John	20	12	And seeth two angels in white sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
KJV	John	20	13	And they say unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? She saith unto them , Because they have taken away my Lord , and I know not where they have laid him .
KJV	John	20	14	And when she had thus said , she turned herself back , and saw Jesus standing , and knew not that it was Jesus .
KJV	John	20	15	Jesus saith unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? whom seekest thou ? She , supposing him to be the gardener , saith unto him , Sir , if thou have borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away .
KJV	John	20	16	Jesus saith unto her , Mary . She turned herself , and saith unto him , Rabboni ; which is to say , Master .
KJV	John	20	17	Jesus saith unto her , Touch me not ; for I am not yet ascended to my Father : but go to my brethren , and say unto them , I ascend unto my Father , and your Father ; and to my God , and your God .
KJV	John	20	18	Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord , and that he had spoken these things unto her .
KJV	John	20	19	Then the same day at evening , being the first day of the week , when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews , came Jesus and stood in the midst , and saith unto them , Peace be unto you .
KJV	John	20	21	Then said Jesus to them again , Peace be unto you : as my Father hath sent me , even so send I you .
KJV	John	20	22	And when he had said this , he breathed on them , and saith unto them , Receive ye the Holy Ghost :
KJV	John	20	23	Whose soever sins ye remit , they are remitted unto them ; and whose soever sins ye retain , they are retained .
KJV	John	20	24	But Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came .
KJV	John	20	25	The other disciples therefore said unto him , We have seen the Lord . But he said unto them , Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails , and put my finger into the print of the nails , and thrust my hand into his side , I will not believe .
KJV	John	20	26	And after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them : then came Jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be unto you .
KJV	John	20	27	Then saith he to Thomas , Reach hither thy finger , and behold my hands ; and reach hither thy hand , and thrust it into my side : and be not faithless , but believing .
KJV	John	20	28	And Thomas answered and said unto him , My Lord and my God .
KJV	John	20	29	Jesus saith unto him , Thomas , because thou hast seen me , thou hast believed : blessed are they that have not seen , and yet have believed .
KJV	John	20	30	And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples , which are not written in this book :
KJV	John	20	31	But these are written , that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God ; and that believing ye might have life through his name .
KJV	John	21	21	Peter seeing him saith to Jesus , Lord , and what shall this man do ?
KJV	John	21	2	There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas called Didymus , and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , and the sons of Zebedee , and two other of his disciples .
KJV	John	21	3	Simon Peter saith unto them , I go a fishing . They say unto him , We also go with thee . They went forth , and entered into a ship immediately ; and that night they caught nothing .
KJV	John	21	4	But when the morning was now come , Jesus stood on the shore : but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus .
KJV	John	21	5	Then Jesus saith unto them , Children , have ye any meat ? They answered him , No .
KJV	John	21	6	And he said unto them , Cast the net on the right side of the ship , and ye shall find . They cast therefore , and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes .
KJV	John	21	7	Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter , It is the Lord . Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he girt his fisher 's coat unto him , ( for he was naked , ) and did cast himself into the sea .
KJV	John	21	8	And the other disciples came in a little ship ; ( for they were not far from land , but as it were two hundred cubits , ) dragging the net with fishes .
KJV	John	21	9	As soon then as they were come to land , they saw a fire of coals there , and fish laid thereon , and bread .
KJV	John	21	10	Jesus saith unto them , Bring of the fish which ye have now caught .
KJV	John	21	11	Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great fishes , an hundred and fifty and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
KJV	John	21	12	Jesus saith unto them , Come and dine . And none of the disciples durst ask him , Who art thou ? knowing that it was the Lord .
KJV	John	21	13	Jesus then cometh , and taketh bread , and giveth them , and fish likewise .
KJV	John	21	14	This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples , after that he was risen from the dead .
KJV	John	21	15	So when they had dined , Jesus saith to Simon Peter , Simon , son of Jonas , lovest thou me more than these ? He saith unto him , Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I love thee . He saith unto him , Feed my lambs .
KJV	John	21	16	He saith to him again the second time , Simon , son of Jonas , lovest thou me ? He saith unto him , Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I love thee . He saith unto him , Feed my sheep .
KJV	John	21	17	He saith unto him the third time , Simon , son of Jonas , lovest thou me ? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time , Lovest thou me ? And he said unto him , Lord , thou knowest all things ; thou knowest that I love thee . Jesus saith unto him , Feed my sheep .
KJV	John	21	18	Verily , verily , I say unto thee , When thou wast young , thou girdest thyself , and walkedst whither thou wouldest : but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands , and another shall gird thee , and carry thee whither thou wouldest not .
KJV	John	21	19	This spake he , signifying by what death he should glorify God . And when he had spoken this , he saith unto him , Follow me .
KJV	John	21	20	Then Peter , turning about , seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following ; which also leaned on his breast at supper , and said , Lord , which is he that betrayeth thee ?
KJV	John	21	22	Jesus saith unto him , If I will that he tarry till I come , what is that to thee ? follow thou me .
KJV	John	21	23	Then went this saying abroad among the brethren , that that disciple should not die : yet Jesus said not unto him , He shall not die ; but , If I will that he tarry till I come , what is that to thee ?
KJV	John	21	24	This is the disciple which testifieth of these things , and wrote these things : and we know that his testimony is true .
KJV	John	21	25	And there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which , if they should be written every one , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . Amen .
KJV	Romans	1	1	Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , called to be an apostle , separated unto the gospel of God ,
KJV	Romans	1	2	( Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures , )
KJV	Romans	1	3	Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord , which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh ;
KJV	Romans	1	4	And declared to be the Son of God with power , according to the spirit of holiness , by the resurrection from the dead :
KJV	Romans	1	5	By whom we have received grace and apostleship , for obedience to the faith among all nations , for his name :
KJV	Romans	1	6	Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ :
KJV	Romans	1	7	To all that be in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : Grace to you and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	Romans	1	8	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all , that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world .
KJV	Romans	1	9	For God is my witness , whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son , that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers ;
KJV	Romans	1	10	Making request , if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you .
KJV	Romans	1	11	For I long to see you , that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift , to the end ye may be established ;
KJV	Romans	1	12	That is , that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me .
KJV	Romans	1	13	Now I would not have you ignorant , brethren , that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you , ( but was let hitherto , ) that I might have some fruit among you also , even as among other Gentiles .
KJV	Romans	1	14	I am debtor both to the Greeks , and to the Barbarians ; both to the wise , and to the unwise .
KJV	Romans	1	15	So , as much as in me is , I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also .
KJV	Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
KJV	Romans	1	17	For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith : as it is written , The just shall live by faith .
KJV	Romans	1	18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who hold the truth in unrighteousness ;
KJV	Romans	1	19	Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them ; for God hath shewed it unto them .
KJV	Romans	1	20	For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead ; so that they are without excuse :
KJV	Romans	1	21	Because that , when they knew God , they glorified him not as God , neither were thankful ; but became vain in their imaginations , and their foolish heart was darkened .
KJV	Romans	1	22	Professing themselves to be wise , they became fools ,
KJV	Romans	1	23	And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man , and to birds , and fourfooted beasts , and creeping things .
KJV	Romans	1	24	Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts , to dishonour their own bodies between themselves :
KJV	Romans	1	25	Who changed the truth of God into a lie , and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator , who is blessed for ever . Amen .
KJV	Romans	1	26	For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections : for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature :
KJV	Romans	1	27	And likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is unseemly , and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet .
KJV	Romans	1	28	And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them over to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not convenient ;
KJV	Romans	1	29	Being filled with all unrighteousness , fornication , wickedness , covetousness , maliciousness ; full of envy , murder , debate , deceit , malignity ; whisperers ,
KJV	Romans	1	30	Backbiters , haters of God , despiteful , proud , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
KJV	Romans	1	31	Without understanding , covenantbreakers , without natural affection , implacable , unmerciful :
KJV	Romans	1	32	Who knowing the judgment of God , that they which commit such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but have pleasure in them that do them .
KJV	Romans	2	2	But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things .
KJV	Romans	2	3	And thinkest thou this , O man , that judgest them which do such things , and doest the same , that thou shalt escape the judgment of God ?
KJV	Romans	2	4	Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering ; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance ?
KJV	Romans	2	5	But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God ;
KJV	Romans	2	6	Who will render to every man according to his deeds :
KJV	Romans	2	7	To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality , eternal life :
KJV	Romans	2	8	But unto them that are contentious , and do not obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , indignation and wrath ,
KJV	Romans	2	9	Tribulation and anguish , upon every soul of man that doeth evil , of the Jew first , and also of the Gentile ;
KJV	Romans	2	10	But glory , honour , and peace , to every man that worketh good , to the Jew first , and also to the Gentile :
KJV	Romans	2	11	For there is no respect of persons with God .
KJV	Romans	2	12	For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law : and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law ;
KJV	Romans	2	13	( For not the hearers of the law are just before God , but the doers of the law shall be justified .
KJV	Romans	2	14	For when the Gentiles , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , these , having not the law , are a law unto themselves :
KJV	Romans	2	15	Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience also bearing witness , and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another ; )
KJV	Romans	2	16	In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel .
KJV	Romans	2	17	Behold , thou art called a Jew , and restest in the law , and makest thy boast of God ,
KJV	Romans	2	18	And knowest his will , and approvest the things that are more excellent , being instructed out of the law ;
KJV	Romans	2	19	And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind , a light of them which are in darkness ,
KJV	Romans	2	20	An instructor of the foolish , a teacher of babes , which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law .
KJV	Romans	2	21	Thou therefore which teachest another , teachest thou not thyself ? thou that preachest a man should not steal , dost thou steal ?
KJV	Romans	2	22	Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery , dost thou commit adultery ? thou that abhorrest idols , dost thou commit sacrilege ?
KJV	Romans	2	23	Thou that makest thy boast of the law , through breaking the law dishonourest thou God ?
KJV	Romans	2	24	For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you , as it is written .
KJV	Romans	2	25	For circumcision verily profiteth , if thou keep the law : but if thou be a breaker of the law , thy circumcision is made uncircumcision .
KJV	Romans	2	26	Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law , shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision ?
KJV	Romans	2	27	And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature , if it fulfil the law , judge thee , who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law ?
KJV	Romans	2	28	For he is not a Jew , which is one outwardly ; neither is that circumcision , which is outward in the flesh :
KJV	Romans	2	29	But he is a Jew , which is one inwardly ; and circumcision is that of the heart , in the spirit , and not in the letter ; whose praise is not of men , but of God .
KJV	Romans	3	3	For what if some did not believe ? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect ?
KJV	Romans	3	2	Much every way : chiefly , because that unto them were committed the oracles of God .
KJV	Romans	3	4	God forbid : yea , let God be true , but every man a liar ; as it is written , That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings , and mightest overcome when thou art judged .
KJV	Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance ? ( I speak as a man )
KJV	Romans	3	6	God forbid : for then how shall God judge the world ?
KJV	Romans	3	7	For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory ; why yet am I also judged as a sinner ?
KJV	Romans	3	8	And not rather , ( as we be slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say , ) Let us do evil , that good may come ? whose damnation is just .
KJV	Romans	3	9	What then ? are we better than they ? No , in no wise : for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles , that they are all under sin ;
KJV	Romans	3	10	As it is written , There is none righteous , no , not one :
KJV	Romans	3	11	There is none that understandeth , there is none that seeketh after God .
KJV	Romans	3	12	They are all gone out of the way , they are together become unprofitable ; there is none that doeth good , no , not one .
KJV	Romans	3	13	Their throat is an open sepulchre ; with their tongues they have used deceit ; the poison of asps is under their lips :
KJV	Romans	3	14	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness :
KJV	Romans	3	15	Their feet are swift to shed blood :
KJV	Romans	3	16	Destruction and misery are in their ways :
KJV	Romans	3	17	And the way of peace have they not known :
KJV	Romans	3	18	There is no fear of God before their eyes .
KJV	Romans	3	19	Now we know that what things soever the law saith , it saith to them who are under the law : that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God .
KJV	Romans	3	20	Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight : for by the law is the knowledge of sin .
KJV	Romans	3	21	But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested , being witnessed by the law and the prophets ;
KJV	Romans	3	22	Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe : for there is no difference :
KJV	Romans	3	23	For all have sinned , and come short of the glory of God ;
KJV	Romans	3	24	Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus :
KJV	Romans	3	25	Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood , to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past , through the forbearance of God ;
KJV	Romans	3	26	To declare , I say , at this time his righteousness : that he might be just , and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus .
KJV	Romans	3	27	Where is boasting then ? It is excluded . By what law ? of works ? Nay : but by the law of faith .
KJV	Romans	3	28	Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law .
KJV	Romans	3	29	Is he the God of the Jews only ? is he not also of the Gentiles ? Yes , of the Gentiles also :
KJV	Romans	3	30	Seeing it is one God , which shall justify the circumcision by faith , and uncircumcision through faith .
KJV	Romans	3	31	Do we then make void the law through faith ? God forbid : yea , we establish the law .
KJV	Romans	4	4	Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace , but of debt .
KJV	Romans	4	2	For if Abraham were justified by works , he hath whereof to glory ; but not before God .
KJV	Romans	4	3	For what saith the scripture ? Abraham believed God , and it was counted unto him for righteousness .
KJV	Romans	4	5	But to him that worketh not , but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly , his faith is counted for righteousness .
KJV	Romans	4	6	Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man , unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works ,
KJV	Romans	4	7	Saying , Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven , and whose sins are covered .
KJV	Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin .
KJV	Romans	4	9	Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only , or upon the uncircumcision also ? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness .
KJV	Romans	4	10	How was it then reckoned ? when he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? Not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
KJV	Romans	4	11	And he received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised : that he might be the father of all them that believe , though they be not circumcised ; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also :
KJV	Romans	4	12	And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had being yet uncircumcised .
KJV	Romans	4	13	For the promise , that he should be the heir of the world , was not to Abraham , or to his seed , through the law , but through the righteousness of faith .
KJV	Romans	4	14	For if they which are of the law be heirs , faith is made void , and the promise made of none effect :
KJV	Romans	4	15	Because the law worketh wrath : for where no law is , there is no transgression .
KJV	Romans	4	16	Therefore it is of faith , that it might be by grace ; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed ; not to that only which is of the law , but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham ; who is the father of us all ,
KJV	Romans	4	17	( As it is written , I have made thee a father of many nations , ) before him whom he believed , even God , who quickeneth the dead , and calleth those things which be not as though they were .
KJV	Romans	4	18	Who against hope believed in hope , that he might become the father of many nations , according to that which was spoken , So shall thy seed be .
KJV	Romans	4	19	And being not weak in faith , he considered not his own body now dead , when he was about an hundred years old , neither yet the deadness of Sarah 's womb :
KJV	Romans	4	20	He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief ; but was strong in faith , giving glory to God ;
KJV	Romans	4	21	And being fully persuaded that , what he had promised , he was able also to perform .
KJV	Romans	4	22	And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness .
KJV	Romans	4	23	Now it was not written for his sake alone , that it was imputed to him ;
KJV	Romans	4	24	But for us also , to whom it shall be imputed , if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead ;
KJV	Romans	4	25	Who was delivered for our offences , and was raised again for our justification .
KJV	Romans	5	5	And hope maketh not ashamed ; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us .
KJV	Romans	5	2	By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand , and rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
KJV	Romans	5	3	And not only so , but we glory in tribulations also : knowing that tribulation worketh patience ;
KJV	Romans	5	4	And patience , experience ; and experience , hope :
KJV	Romans	5	6	For when we were yet without strength , in due time Christ died for the ungodly .
KJV	Romans	5	7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die : yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die .
KJV	Romans	5	8	But God commendeth his love toward us , in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us .
KJV	Romans	5	9	Much more then , being now justified by his blood , we shall be saved from wrath through him .
KJV	Romans	5	10	For if , when we were enemies , we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we shall be saved by his life .
KJV	Romans	5	11	And not only so , but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom we have now received the atonement .
KJV	Romans	5	12	Wherefore , as by one man sin entered into the world , and death by sin ; and so death passed upon all men , for that all have sinned :
KJV	Romans	5	13	( For until the law sin was in the world : but sin is not imputed when there is no law .
KJV	Romans	5	14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam 's transgression , who is the figure of him that was to come .
KJV	Romans	5	15	But not as the offence , so also is the free gift . For if through the offence of one many be dead , much more the grace of God , and the gift by grace , which is by one man , Jesus Christ , hath abounded unto many .
KJV	Romans	5	16	And not as it was by one that sinned , so is the gift : for the judgment was by one to condemnation , but the free gift is of many offences unto justification .
KJV	Romans	5	17	For if by one man 's offence death reigned by one ; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one , Jesus Christ . )
KJV	Romans	5	18	Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation ; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life .
KJV	Romans	5	19	For as by one man 's disobedience many were made sinners , so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous .
KJV	Romans	5	20	Moreover the law entered , that the offence might abound . But where sin abounded , grace did much more abound :
KJV	Romans	5	21	That as sin hath reigned unto death , even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord .
KJV	Romans	6	6	Knowing this , that our old man is crucified with him , that the body of sin might be destroyed , that henceforth we should not serve sin .
KJV	Romans	6	2	God forbid . How shall we , that are dead to sin , live any longer therein ?
KJV	Romans	6	3	Know ye not , that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death ?
KJV	Romans	6	4	Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death : that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father , even so we also should walk in newness of life .
KJV	Romans	6	5	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death , we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection :
KJV	Romans	6	7	For he that is dead is freed from sin .
KJV	Romans	6	8	Now if we be dead with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with him :
KJV	Romans	6	9	Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more ; death hath no more dominion over him .
KJV	Romans	6	10	For in that he died , he died unto sin once : but in that he liveth , he liveth unto God .
KJV	Romans	6	11	Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin , but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord .
KJV	Romans	6	12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body , that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof .
KJV	Romans	6	13	Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin : but yield yourselves unto God , as those that are alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God .
KJV	Romans	6	14	For sin shall not have dominion over you : for ye are not under the law , but under grace .
KJV	Romans	6	15	What then ? shall we sin , because we are not under the law , but under grace ? God forbid .
KJV	Romans	6	16	Know ye not , that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey , his servants ye are to whom ye obey ; whether of sin unto death , or of obedience unto righteousness ?
KJV	Romans	6	17	But God be thanked , that ye were the servants of sin , but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you .
KJV	Romans	6	18	Being then made free from sin , ye became the servants of righteousness .
KJV	Romans	6	19	I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh : for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity ; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness .
KJV	Romans	6	20	For when ye were the servants of sin , ye were free from righteousness .
KJV	Romans	6	21	What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed ? for the end of those things is death .
KJV	Romans	6	22	But now being made free from sin , and become servants to God , ye have your fruit unto holiness , and the end everlasting life .
KJV	Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death ; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
KJV	Romans	7	7	What shall we say then ? Is the law sin ? God forbid . Nay , I had not known sin , but by the law : for I had not known lust , except the law had said , Thou shalt not covet .
KJV	Romans	7	2	For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth ; but if the husband be dead , she is loosed from the law of her husband .
KJV	Romans	7	3	So then if , while her husband liveth , she be married to another man , she shall be called an adulteress : but if her husband be dead , she is free from that law ; so that she is no adulteress , though she be married to another man .
KJV	Romans	7	4	Wherefore , my brethren , ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ ; that ye should be married to another , even to him who is raised from the dead , that we should bring forth fruit unto God .
KJV	Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh , the motions of sins , which were by the law , did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death .
KJV	Romans	7	6	But now we are delivered from the law , that being dead wherein we were held ; that we should serve in newness of spirit , and not in the oldness of the letter .
KJV	Romans	7	8	But sin , taking occasion by the commandment , wrought in me all manner of concupiscence . For without the law sin was dead .
KJV	Romans	7	9	For I was alive without the law once : but when the commandment came , sin revived , and I died .
KJV	Romans	7	10	And the commandment , which was ordained to life , I found to be unto death .
KJV	Romans	7	11	For sin , taking occasion by the commandment , deceived me , and by it slew me .
KJV	Romans	7	12	Wherefore the law is holy , and the commandment holy , and just , and good .
KJV	Romans	7	13	Was then that which is good made death unto me ? God forbid . But sin , that it might appear sin , working death in me by that which is good ; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful .
KJV	Romans	7	14	For we know that the law is spiritual : but I am carnal , sold under sin .
KJV	Romans	7	15	For that which I do I allow not : for what I would , that do I not ; but what I hate , that do I .
KJV	Romans	7	16	If then I do that which I would not , I consent unto the law that it is good .
KJV	Romans	7	17	Now then it is no more I that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .
KJV	Romans	7	18	For I know that in me ( that is , in my flesh , ) dwelleth no good thing : for to will is present with me ; but how to perform that which is good I find not .
KJV	Romans	7	19	For the good that I would I do not : but the evil which I would not , that I do .
KJV	Romans	7	20	Now if I do that I would not , it is no more I that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .
KJV	Romans	7	21	I find then a law , that , when I would do good , evil is present with me .
KJV	Romans	7	22	For I delight in the law of God after the inward man :
KJV	Romans	7	23	But I see another law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members .
KJV	Romans	7	24	O wretched man that I am ! who shall deliver me from the body of this death ?
KJV	Romans	7	25	I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord . So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God ; but with the flesh the law of sin .
KJV	Romans	8	8	So then they that are in the flesh can not please God .
KJV	Romans	8	2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death .
KJV	Romans	8	3	For what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh :
KJV	Romans	8	4	That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
KJV	Romans	8	5	For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh ; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit .
KJV	Romans	8	6	For to be carnally minded is death ; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace .
KJV	Romans	8	7	Because the carnal mind is enmity against God : for it is not subject to the law of God , neither indeed can be .
KJV	Romans	8	9	But ye are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you . Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his .
KJV	Romans	8	10	And if Christ be in you , the body is dead because of sin ; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness .
KJV	Romans	8	11	But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you , he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you .
KJV	Romans	8	12	Therefore , brethren , we are debtors , not to the flesh , to live after the flesh .
KJV	Romans	8	13	For if ye live after the flesh , ye shall die : but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body , ye shall live .
KJV	Romans	8	14	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God , they are the sons of God .
KJV	Romans	8	15	For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear ; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption , whereby we cry , Abba , Father .
KJV	Romans	8	16	The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit , that we are the children of God :
KJV	Romans	8	17	And if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint-heirs with Christ ; if so be that we suffer with him , that we may be also glorified together .
KJV	Romans	8	18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us .
KJV	Romans	8	19	For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God .
KJV	Romans	8	20	For the creature was made subject to vanity , not willingly , but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope ,
KJV	Romans	8	21	Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God .
KJV	Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now .
KJV	Romans	8	23	And not only they , but ourselves also , which have the firstfruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to wit , the redemption of our body .
KJV	Romans	8	24	For we are saved by hope : but hope that is seen is not hope : for what a man seeth , why doth he yet hope for ?
KJV	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for that we see not , then do we with patience wait for it .
KJV	Romans	8	26	Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities : for we know not what we should pray for as we ought : but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which can not be uttered .
KJV	Romans	8	27	And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit , because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God .
KJV	Romans	8	28	And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God , to them who are the called according to his purpose .
KJV	Romans	8	29	For whom he did foreknow , he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brethren .
KJV	Romans	8	30	Moreover whom he did predestinate , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also justified : and whom he justified , them he also glorified .
KJV	Romans	8	31	What shall we then say to these things ? If God be for us , who can be against us ?
KJV	Romans	8	32	He that spared not his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not with him also freely give us all things ?
KJV	Romans	8	33	Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God 's elect ? It is God that justifieth .
KJV	Romans	8	34	Who is he that condemneth ? It is Christ that died , yea rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also maketh intercession for us .
KJV	Romans	8	35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ?
KJV	Romans	8	36	As it is written , For thy sake we are killed all the day long ; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter .
KJV	Romans	8	37	Nay , in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us .
KJV	Romans	8	38	For I am persuaded , that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor powers , nor things present , nor things to come ,
KJV	Romans	8	39	Nor height , nor depth , nor any other creature , shall be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
KJV	Romans	9	9	For this is the word of promise , At this time will I come , and Sarah shall have a son .
KJV	Romans	9	2	That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart .
KJV	Romans	9	3	For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren , my kinsmen according to the flesh :
KJV	Romans	9	4	Who are Israelites ; to whom pertaineth the adoption , and the glory , and the covenants , and the giving of the law , and the service of God , and the promises ;
KJV	Romans	9	5	Whose are the fathers , and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came , who is over all , God blessed for ever . Amen .
KJV	Romans	9	6	Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect . For they are not all Israel , which are of Israel :
KJV	Romans	9	7	Neither , because they are the seed of Abraham , are they all children : but , In Isaac shall thy seed be called .
KJV	Romans	9	8	That is , They which are the children of the flesh , these are not the children of God : but the children of the promise are counted for the seed .
KJV	Romans	9	10	And not only this ; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one , even by our father Isaac ;
KJV	Romans	9	11	( For the children being not yet born , neither having done any good or evil , that the purpose of God according to election might stand , not of works , but of him that calleth ; )
KJV	Romans	9	12	It was said unto her , The elder shall serve the younger .
KJV	Romans	9	13	As it is written , Jacob have I loved , but Esau have I hated .
KJV	Romans	9	14	What shall we say then ? Is there unrighteousness with God ? God forbid .
KJV	Romans	9	15	For he saith to Moses , I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy , and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion .
KJV	Romans	9	16	So then it is not of him that willeth , nor of him that runneth , but of God that sheweth mercy .
KJV	Romans	9	17	For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh , Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up , that I might shew my power in thee , and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth .
KJV	Romans	9	18	Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy , and whom he will he hardeneth .
KJV	Romans	9	19	Thou wilt say then unto me , Why doth he yet find fault ? For who hath resisted his will ?
KJV	Romans	9	20	Nay but , O man , who art thou that repliest against God ? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it , Why hast thou made me thus ?
KJV	Romans	9	21	Hath not the potter power over the clay , of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour , and another unto dishonour ?
KJV	Romans	9	22	What if God , willing to shew his wrath , and to make his power known , endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction :
KJV	Romans	9	23	And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy , which he had afore prepared unto glory ,
KJV	Romans	9	24	Even us , whom he hath called , not of the Jews only , but also of the Gentiles ?
KJV	Romans	9	25	As he saith also in Osee , I will call them my people , which were not my people ; and her beloved , which was not beloved .
KJV	Romans	9	26	And it shall come to pass , that in the place where it was said unto them , Ye are not my people ; there shall they be called the children of the living God .
KJV	Romans	9	27	Esaias also crieth concerning Israel , Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea , a remnant shall be saved :
KJV	Romans	9	28	For he will finish the work , and cut it short in righteousness : because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth .
KJV	Romans	9	29	And as Esaias said before , Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed , we had been as Sodoma , and been made like unto Gomorrha .
KJV	Romans	9	30	What shall we say then ? That the Gentiles , which followed not after righteousness , have attained to righteousness , even the righteousness which is of faith .
KJV	Romans	9	31	But Israel , which followed after the law of righteousness , hath not attained to the law of righteousness .
KJV	Romans	9	32	Wherefore ? Because they sought it not by faith , but as it were by the works of the law . For they stumbled at that stumblingstone ;
KJV	Romans	9	33	As it is written , Behold , I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence : and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed .
KJV	Romans	10	10	For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness ; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation .
KJV	Romans	10	2	For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God , but not according to knowledge .
KJV	Romans	10	3	For they being ignorant of God 's righteousness , and going about to establish their own righteousness , have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God .
KJV	Romans	10	4	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth .
KJV	Romans	10	5	For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law , That the man which doeth those things shall live by them .
KJV	Romans	10	6	But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise , Say not in thine heart , Who shall ascend into heaven ? ( that is , to bring Christ down from above : )
KJV	Romans	10	7	Or , Who shall descend into the deep ? ( that is , to bring up Christ again from the dead . )
KJV	Romans	10	8	But what saith it ? The word is nigh thee , even in thy mouth , and in thy heart : that is , the word of faith , which we preach ;
KJV	Romans	10	9	That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead , thou shalt be saved .
KJV	Romans	10	11	For the scripture saith , Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed .
KJV	Romans	10	12	For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek : for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him .
KJV	Romans	10	13	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved .
KJV	Romans	10	14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher ?
KJV	Romans	10	15	And how shall they preach , except they be sent ? as it is written , How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace , and bring glad tidings of good things !
KJV	Romans	10	16	But they have not all obeyed the gospel . For Esaias saith , Lord , who hath believed our report ?
KJV	Romans	10	17	So then faith cometh by hearing , and hearing by the word of God .
KJV	Romans	10	18	But I say , Have they not heard ? Yes verily , their sound went into all the earth , and their words unto the ends of the world .
KJV	Romans	10	19	But I say , Did not Israel know ? First Moses saith , I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people , and by a foolish nation I will anger you .
KJV	Romans	10	20	But Esaias is very bold , and saith , I was found of them that sought me not ; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me .
KJV	Romans	10	21	But to Israel he saith , All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people .
KJV	Romans	11	11	I say then , Have they stumbled that they should fall ? God forbid : but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles , for to provoke them to jealousy .
KJV	Romans	11	2	God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew . Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias ? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying ,
KJV	Romans	11	3	Lord , they have killed thy prophets , and digged down thine altars ; and I am left alone , and they seek my life .
KJV	Romans	11	4	But what saith the answer of God unto him ? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal .
KJV	Romans	11	5	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace .
KJV	Romans	11	6	And if by grace , then is it no more of works : otherwise grace is no more grace . But if it be of works , then it is no more grace : otherwise work is no more work .
KJV	Romans	11	7	What then ? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for ; but the election hath obtained it , and the rest were blinded .
KJV	Romans	11	8	( According as it is written , God hath given them the spirit of slumber , eyes that they should not see , and ears that they should not hear ; ) unto this day .
KJV	Romans	11	9	And David saith , Let their table be made a snare , and a trap , and a stumblingblock , and a recompence unto them :
KJV	Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened , that they may not see , and bow down their back alway .
KJV	Romans	11	12	Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world , and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles ; how much more their fulness ?
KJV	Romans	11	13	For I speak to you Gentiles , inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles , I magnify mine office :
KJV	Romans	11	14	If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh , and might save some of them .
KJV	Romans	11	15	For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world , what shall the receiving of them be , but life from the dead ?
KJV	Romans	11	16	For if the firstfruit be holy , the lump is also holy : and if the root be holy , so are the branches .
KJV	Romans	11	17	And if some of the branches be broken off , and thou , being a wild olive tree , wert grafted in among them , and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree ;
KJV	Romans	11	18	Boast not against the branches . But if thou boast , thou bearest not the root , but the root thee .
KJV	Romans	11	19	Thou wilt say then , The branches were broken off , that I might be grafted in .
KJV	Romans	11	20	Well ; because of unbelief they were broken off , and thou standest by faith . Be not highminded , but fear :
KJV	Romans	11	21	For if God spared not the natural branches , take heed lest he also spare not thee .
KJV	Romans	11	22	Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God : on them which fell , severity ; but toward thee , goodness , if thou continue in his goodness : otherwise thou also shalt be cut off .
KJV	Romans	11	23	And they also , if they abide not still in unbelief , shall be grafted in : for God is able to graft them in again .
KJV	Romans	11	24	For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature , and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree : how much more shall these , which be the natural branches , be grafted into their own olive tree ?
KJV	Romans	11	25	For I would not , brethren , that ye should be ignorant of this mystery , lest ye should be wise in your own conceits ; that blindness in part is happened to Israel , until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in .
KJV	Romans	11	26	And so all Israel shall be saved : as it is written , There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer , and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob :
KJV	Romans	11	27	For this is my covenant unto them , when I shall take away their sins .
KJV	Romans	11	28	As concerning the gospel , they are enemies for your sakes : but as touching the election , they are beloved for the father 's sakes .
KJV	Romans	11	29	For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance .
KJV	Romans	11	30	For as ye in times past have not believed God , yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief :
KJV	Romans	11	31	Even so have these also now not believed , that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy .
KJV	Romans	11	32	For God hath concluded them all in unbelief , that he might have mercy upon all .
KJV	Romans	11	33	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! how unsearchable are his judgments , and his ways past finding out !
KJV	Romans	11	34	For who hath known the mind of the Lord ? or who hath been his counsellor ?
KJV	Romans	11	35	Or who hath first given to him , and it shall be recompensed unto him again ?
KJV	Romans	11	36	For of him , and through him , and to him , are all things : to whom be glory for ever . Amen .
KJV	Romans	12	12	Rejoicing in hope ; patient in tribulation ; continuing instant in prayer ;
KJV	Romans	12	2	And be not conformed to this world : but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good , and acceptable , and perfect , will of God .
KJV	Romans	12	3	For I say , through the grace given unto me , to every man that is among you , not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think ; but to think soberly , according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith .
KJV	Romans	12	4	For as we have many members in one body , and all members have not the same office :
KJV	Romans	12	5	So we , being many , are one body in Christ , and every one members one of another .
KJV	Romans	12	6	Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us , whether prophecy , let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith ;
KJV	Romans	12	7	Or ministry , let us wait on our ministering : or he that teacheth , on teaching ;
KJV	Romans	12	8	Or he that exhorteth , on exhortation : he that giveth , let him do it with simplicity ; he that ruleth , with diligence ; he that sheweth mercy , with cheerfulness .
KJV	Romans	12	9	Let love be without dissimulation . Abhor that which is evil ; cleave to that which is good .
KJV	Romans	12	10	Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love ; in honour preferring one another ;
KJV	Romans	12	11	Not slothful in business ; fervent in spirit ; serving the Lord ;
KJV	Romans	12	13	Distributing to the necessity of saints ; given to hospitality .
KJV	Romans	12	14	Bless them which persecute you : bless , and curse not .
KJV	Romans	12	15	Rejoice with them that do rejoice , and weep with them that weep .
KJV	Romans	12	16	Be of the same mind one toward another . Mind not high things , but condescend to men of low estate . Be not wise in your own conceits .
KJV	Romans	12	17	Recompense to no man evil for evil . Provide things honest in the sight of all men .
KJV	Romans	12	18	If it be possible , as much as lieth in you , live peaceably with all men .
KJV	Romans	12	19	Dearly beloved , avenge not yourselves , but rather give place unto wrath : for it is written , Vengeance is mine ; I will repay , saith the Lord .
KJV	Romans	12	20	Therefore if thine enemy hunger , feed him ; if he thirst , give him drink : for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head .
KJV	Romans	12	21	Be not overcome of evil , but overcome evil with good .
KJV	Romans	13	13	Let us walk honestly , as in the day ; not in rioting and drunkenness , not in chambering and wantonness , not in strife and envying .
KJV	Romans	13	2	Whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God : and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation .
KJV	Romans	13	3	For rulers are not a terror to good works , but to the evil . Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power ? do that which is good , and thou shalt have praise of the same :
KJV	Romans	13	4	For he is the minister of God to thee for good . But if thou do that which is evil , be afraid ; for he beareth not the sword in vain : for he is the minister of God , a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil .
KJV	Romans	13	5	Wherefore ye must needs be subject , not only for wrath , but also for conscience sake .
KJV	Romans	13	6	For for this cause pay ye tribute also : for they are God 's ministers , attending continually upon this very thing .
KJV	Romans	13	7	Render therefore to all their dues : tribute to whom tribute is due ; custom to whom custom ; fear to whom fear ; honour to whom honour .
KJV	Romans	13	8	Owe no man any thing , but to love one another : for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law .
KJV	Romans	13	9	For this , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not kill , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false witness , Thou shalt not covet ; and if there be any other commandment , it is briefly comprehended in this saying , namely , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
KJV	Romans	13	10	Love worketh no ill to his neighbour : therefore love is the fulfilling of the law .
KJV	Romans	13	11	And that , knowing the time , that now it is high time to awake out of sleep : for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed .
KJV	Romans	13	12	The night is far spent , the day is at hand : let us therefore cast off the works of darkness , and let us put on the armour of light .
KJV	Romans	13	14	But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make not provision for the flesh , to fulfil the lusts thereof .
KJV	Romans	14	14	I know , and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus , that there is nothing unclean of itself : but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
KJV	Romans	14	2	For one believeth that he may eat all things : another , who is weak , eateth herbs .
KJV	Romans	14	3	Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not ; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth : for God hath received him .
KJV	Romans	14	4	Who art thou that judgest another man 's servant ? to his own master he standeth or falleth . Yea , he shall be holden up : for God is able to make him stand .
KJV	Romans	14	5	One man esteemeth one day above another : another esteemeth every day alike . Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind .
KJV	Romans	14	6	He that regardeth the day , regardeth it unto the Lord ; and he that regardeth not the day , to the Lord he doth not regard it . He that eateth , eateth to the Lord , for he giveth God thanks ; and he that eateth not , to the Lord he eateth not , and giveth God thanks .
KJV	Romans	14	7	For none of us liveth to himself , and no man dieth to himself .
KJV	Romans	14	8	For whether we live , we live unto the Lord ; and whether we die , we die unto the Lord : whether we live therefore , or die , we are the Lord 's .
KJV	Romans	14	9	For to this end Christ both died , and rose , and revived , that he might be Lord both of the dead and living .
KJV	Romans	14	10	But why dost thou judge thy brother ? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother ? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
KJV	Romans	14	11	For it is written , As I live , saith the Lord , every knee shall bow to me , and every tongue shall confess to God .
KJV	Romans	14	12	So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God .
KJV	Romans	14	13	Let us not therefore judge one another any more : but judge this rather , that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother 's way .
KJV	Romans	14	15	But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat , now walkest thou not charitably . Destroy not him with thy meat , for whom Christ died .
KJV	Romans	14	16	Let not then your good be evil spoken of :
KJV	Romans	14	17	For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink ; but righteousness , and peace , and joy in the Holy Ghost .
KJV	Romans	14	18	For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God , and approved of men .
KJV	Romans	14	19	Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace , and things wherewith one may edify another .
KJV	Romans	14	20	For meat destroy not the work of God . All things indeed are pure ; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence .
KJV	Romans	14	21	It is good neither to eat flesh , nor to drink wine , nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth , or is offended , or is made weak .
KJV	Romans	14	22	Hast thou faith ? have it to thyself before God . Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth .
KJV	Romans	14	23	And he that doubteth is damned if he eat , because he eateth not of faith : for whatsoever is not of faith is sin .
KJV	Romans	15	15	Nevertheless , brethren , I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me of God ,
KJV	Romans	15	2	Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification .
KJV	Romans	15	3	For even Christ pleased not himself ; but , as it is written , The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me .
KJV	Romans	15	4	For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning , that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope .
KJV	Romans	15	5	Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus :
KJV	Romans	15	6	That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	Romans	15	7	Wherefore receive ye one another , as Christ also received us to the glory of God .
KJV	Romans	15	8	Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God , to confirm the promises made unto the fathers :
KJV	Romans	15	9	And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy ; as it is written , For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles , and sing unto thy name .
KJV	Romans	15	10	And again he saith , Rejoice , ye Gentiles , with his people .
KJV	Romans	15	11	And again , Praise the Lord , all ye Gentiles ; and laud him , all ye people .
KJV	Romans	15	12	And again , Esaias saith , There shall be a root of Jesse , and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles ; in him shall the Gentiles trust .
KJV	Romans	15	13	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that ye may abound in hope , through the power of the Holy Ghost .
KJV	Romans	15	14	And I myself also am persuaded of you , my brethren , that ye also are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish one another .
KJV	Romans	15	16	That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles , ministering the gospel of God , that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable , being sanctified by the Holy Ghost .
KJV	Romans	15	17	I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God .
KJV	Romans	15	18	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me , to make the Gentiles obedient , by word and deed ,
KJV	Romans	15	19	Through mighty signs and wonders , by the power of the Spirit of God ; so that from Jerusalem , and round about unto Illyricum , I have fully preached the gospel of Christ .
KJV	Romans	15	20	Yea , so have I strived to preach the gospel , not where Christ was named , lest I should build upon another man 's foundation :
KJV	Romans	15	21	But as it is written , To whom he was not spoken of , they shall see : and they that have not heard shall understand .
KJV	Romans	15	22	For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you .
KJV	Romans	15	23	But now having no more place in these parts , and having a great desire these many years to come unto you ;
KJV	Romans	15	24	Whensoever I take my journey into Spain , I will come to you : for I trust to see you in my journey , and to be brought on my way thitherward by you , if first I be somewhat filled with your company .
KJV	Romans	15	25	But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints .
KJV	Romans	15	26	For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem .
KJV	Romans	15	27	It hath pleased them verily ; and their debtors they are . For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things .
KJV	Romans	15	28	When therefore I have performed this , and have sealed to them this fruit , I will come by you into Spain .
KJV	Romans	15	29	And I am sure that , when I come unto you , I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ .
KJV	Romans	15	30	Now I beseech you , brethren , for the Lord Jesus Christ 's sake , and for the love of the Spirit , that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ;
KJV	Romans	15	31	That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea ; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints ;
KJV	Romans	15	32	That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God , and may with you be refreshed .
KJV	Romans	15	33	Now the God of peace be with you all . Amen .
KJV	Romans	16	16	Salute one another with an holy kiss . The churches of Christ salute you .
KJV	Romans	16	2	That ye receive her in the Lord , as becometh saints , and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you : for she hath been a succourer of many , and of myself also .
KJV	Romans	16	3	Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus :
KJV	Romans	16	4	Who have for my life laid down their own necks : unto whom not only I give thanks , but also all the churches of the Gentiles .
KJV	Romans	16	5	Likewise greet the church that is in their house . Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus , who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ .
KJV	Romans	16	6	Greet Mary , who bestowed much labour on us .
KJV	Romans	16	7	Salute Andronicus and Junia , my kinsmen , and my fellow-prisoners , who are of note among the apostles , who also were in Christ before me .
KJV	Romans	16	8	Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord .
KJV	Romans	16	9	Salute Urbane , our helper in Christ , and Stachys my beloved .
KJV	Romans	16	10	Salute Apelles approved in Christ . Salute them which are of Aristobulus ' household .
KJV	Romans	16	11	Salute Herodion my kinsman . Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus , which are in the Lord .
KJV	Romans	16	12	Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa , who labour in the Lord . Salute the beloved Persis , which laboured much in the Lord .
KJV	Romans	16	13	Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord , and his mother and mine .
KJV	Romans	16	14	Salute Asyncritus , Phlegon , Hermas , Patrobas , Hermes , and the brethren which are with them .
KJV	Romans	16	15	Salute Philologus , and Julia , Nereus , and his sister , and Olympas , and all the saints which are with them .
KJV	Romans	16	17	Now I beseech you , brethren , mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned ; and avoid them .
KJV	Romans	16	18	For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ , but their own belly ; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple .
KJV	Romans	16	19	For your obedience is come abroad unto all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good , and simple concerning evil .
KJV	Romans	16	20	And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
KJV	Romans	16	21	Timotheus my workfellow , and Lucius , and Jason , and Sosipater , my kinsmen , salute you .
KJV	Romans	16	22	I Tertius , who wrote this epistle , salute you in the Lord .
KJV	Romans	16	23	Gaius mine host , and of the whole church , saluteth you . Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you , and Quartus a brother .
KJV	Romans	16	24	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
KJV	Romans	16	25	Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel , and the preaching of Jesus Christ , according to the revelation of the mystery , which was kept secret since the world began ,
KJV	Romans	16	26	But now is made manifest , and by the scriptures of the prophets , according to the commandment of the everlasting God , made known to all nations for the obedience of faith :
KJV	Romans	16	27	To God only wise , be glory through Jesus Christ for ever . Amen .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God , and Sosthenes our brother ,
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	2	Unto the church of God which is at Corinth , to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints , with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord , both their 's and our 's :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace be unto you , and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I thank my God always on your behalf , for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	5	That in every thing ye are enriched by him , in all utterance , and in all knowledge ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	6	Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	7	So that ye come behind in no gift ; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	8	Who shall also confirm you unto the end , that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful , by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	10	Now I beseech you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you ; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	11	For it hath been declared unto me of you , my brethren , by them which are of the house of Chloe , that there are contentions among you .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	12	Now this I say , that every one of you saith , I am of Paul ; and I of Apollos ; and I of Cephas ; and I of Christ .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Is Christ divided ? was Paul crucified for you ? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I baptized none of you , but Crispus and Gaius ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	15	Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanas : besides , I know not whether I baptized any other .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	17	For Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the gospel : not with wisdom of words , lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness ; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	19	For it is written , I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise ? where is the scribe ? where is the disputer of this world ? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	21	For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God , it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	22	For the Jews require a sign , and the Greeks seek after wisdom :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	23	But we preach Christ crucified , unto the Jews a stumblingblock , and unto the Greeks foolishness ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	24	But unto them which are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God , and the wisdom of God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men ; and the weakness of God is stronger than men .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	26	For ye see your calling , brethren , how that not many wise men after the flesh , not many mighty , not many noble , are called :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	27	But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise ; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	28	And base things of the world , and things which are despised , hath God chosen , yea , and things which are not , to bring to nought things that are :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	29	That no flesh should glory in his presence .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	30	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus , who of God is made unto us wisdom , and righteousness , and sanctification , and redemption :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	1	31	That , according as it is written , He that glorieth , let him glory in the Lord .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	2	1	Corinthians
KJV	1%20Corinthians	2	2	For I determined not to know any thing among you , save Jesus Christ , and him crucified .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	2	3	And I was with you in weakness , and in fear , and in much trembling .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	2	4	And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man 's wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	2	5	That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	2	6	Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect : yet not the wisdom of this world , nor of the princes of this world , that come to nought :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	2	7	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery , even the hidden wisdom , which God ordained before the world unto our glory :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	2	8	Which none of the princes of this world knew : for had they known it , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	2	9	But as it is written , Eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , neither have entered into the heart of man , the things which God hath prepared for them that love him .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	2	10	But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit : for the Spirit searcheth all things , yea , the deep things of God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	2	11	For what man knoweth the things of a man , save the spirit of man which is in him ? even so the things of God knoweth no man , but the Spirit of God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	2	12	Now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the spirit which is of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	2	13	Which things also we speak , not in the words which man 's wisdom teacheth , but which the Holy Ghost teacheth ; comparing spiritual things with spiritual .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	2	14	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God : for they are foolishness unto him : neither can he know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	2	15	But he that is spiritual judgeth all things , yet he himself is judged of no man .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	2	16	For who hath known the mind of the Lord , that he may instruct him ? but we have the mind of Christ .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	1	Corinthians
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	3	For ye are yet carnal : for whereas there is among you envying , and strife , and divisions , are ye not carnal , and walk as men ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	2	I have fed you with milk , and not with meat : for hitherto ye were not able to bear it , neither yet now are ye able .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	4	For while one saith , I am of Paul ; and another , I am of Apollos ; are ye not carnal ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	5	Who then is Paul , and who is Apollos , but ministers by whom ye believed , even as the Lord gave to every man ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	6	I have planted , Apollos watered ; but God gave the increase .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	7	So then neither is he that planteth any thing , neither he that watereth ; but God that giveth the increase .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	8	Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one : and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	9	For we are labourers together with God : ye are God 's husbandry , ye are God 's building .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God which is given unto me , as a wise masterbuilder , I have laid the foundation , and another buildeth thereon . But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	11	For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid , which is Jesus Christ .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	12	Now if any man build upon this foundation gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , stubble ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	13	Every man 's work shall be made manifest : for the day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire ; and the fire shall try every man 's work of what sort it is .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	14	If any man 's work abide which he hath built thereupon , he shall receive a reward .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	15	If any man 's work shall be burned , he shall suffer loss : but he himself shall be saved ; yet so as by fire .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	16	Know ye not that ye are the temple of God , and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If any man defile the temple of God , him shall God destroy ; for the temple of God is holy , which temple ye are .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Let no man deceive himself . If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world , let him become a fool , that he may be wise .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God . For it is written , He taketh the wise in their own craftiness .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	20	And again , The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise , that they are vain .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	21	Therefore let no man glory in men . For all things are your 's ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	22	Whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come ; all are your 's ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	3	23	And ye are Christ 's ; and Christ is God 's .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	1	Corinthians
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	4	For I know nothing by myself ; yet am I not hereby justified : but he that judgeth me is the Lord .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	2	Moreover it is required in stewards , that a man be found faithful .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you , or of man 's judgment : yea , I judge not mine own self .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	5	Therefore judge nothing before the time , until the Lord come , who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts : and then shall every man have praise of God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	6	And these things , brethren , I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes ; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written , that no one of you be puffed up for one against another .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	7	For who maketh thee to differ from another ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive ? now if thou didst receive it , why dost thou glory , as if thou hadst not received it ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	8	Now ye are full , now ye are rich , ye have reigned as kings without us : and I would to God ye did reign , that we also might reign with you .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	9	For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last , as it were appointed to death : for we are made a spectacle unto the world , and to angels , and to men .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	10	We are fools for Christ 's sake , but ye are wise in Christ ; we are weak , but ye are strong ; ye are honourable , but we are despised .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	11	Even unto this present hour we both hunger , and thirst , and are naked , and are buffeted , and have no certain dwellingplace ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	12	And labour , working with our own hands : being reviled , we bless ; being persecuted , we suffer it :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	13	Being defamed , we intreat : we are made as the filth of the world , and are the offscouring of all things unto this day .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	14	I write not these things to shame you , but as my beloved sons I warn you .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	15	For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ , yet have ye not many fathers : for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	16	Wherefore I beseech you , be ye followers of me .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	17	For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus , who is my beloved son , and faithful in the Lord , who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ , as I teach every where in every church .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	18	Now some are puffed up , as though I would not come to you .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	19	But I will come to you shortly , if the Lord will , and will know , not the speech of them which are puffed up , but the power .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	20	For the kingdom of God is not in word , but in power .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	4	21	What will ye ? shall I come unto you with a rod , or in love , and in the spirit of meekness ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	5	1	Corinthians
KJV	1%20Corinthians	5	5	To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh , that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	5	2	And ye are puffed up , and have not rather mourned , that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	5	3	For I verily , as absent in body , but present in spirit , have judged already , as though I were present , concerning him that hath so done this deed ,
KJV	1%20Corinthians	5	4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , when ye are gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
KJV	1%20Corinthians	5	6	Your glorying is not good . Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	5	7	Purge out therefore the old leaven , that ye may be a new lump , as ye are unleavened . For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	5	8	Therefore let us keep the feast , not with old leaven , neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness ; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	5	9	I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	5	10	Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world , or with the covetous , or extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then must ye needs go out of the world .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	5	11	But now I have written unto you not to keep company , if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator , or covetous , or an idolator , or a railer , or a drunkard , or an extortioner ; with such an one no not to eat .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	5	12	For what have I to do to judge them also that are without ? do not ye judge them that are within ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	5	13	But them that are without God judgeth . Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	1	Corinthians
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	6	But brother goeth to law with brother , and that before the unbelievers .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	2	Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world ? and if the world shall be judged by you , are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	3	Know ye not that we shall judge angels ? how much more things that pertain to this life ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	4	If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life , set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	5	I speak to your shame . Is it so , that there is not a wise man among you ? no , not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	7	Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you , because ye go to law one with another . Why do ye not rather take wrong ? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	8	Nay , ye do wrong , and defraud , and that your brethren .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	9	Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God ? Be not deceived : neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor effeminate , nor abusers of themselves with mankind ,
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	10	Nor thieves , nor covetous , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor extortioners , shall inherit the kingdom of God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	11	And such were some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sanctified , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	12	All things are lawful unto me , but all things are not expedient : all things are lawful for me , but I will not be brought under the power of any .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	13	Meats for the belly , and the belly for meats : but God shall destroy both it and them . Now the body is not for fornication , but for the Lord ; and the Lord for the body .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	14	And God hath both raised up the Lord , and will also raise up us by his own power .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	15	Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ ? shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them the members of an harlot ? God forbid .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	16	What ? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body ? for two , saith he , shall be one flesh .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	17	But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	18	Flee fornication . Every sin that a man doeth is without the body ; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	19	What ? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	6	20	For ye are bought with a price : therefore glorify God in your body , and in your spirit , which are God 's .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	1	Corinthians
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	7	For I would that all men were even as I myself . But every man hath his proper gift of God , one after this manner , and another after that .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	2	Nevertheless , to avoid fornication , let every man have his own wife , and let every woman have her own husband .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	3	Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence : and likewise also the wife unto the husband .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife hath not power of her own body , but the husband : and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body , but the wife .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Defraud ye not one the other , except it be with consent for a time , that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer ; and come together again , that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	6	But I speak this by permission , and not of commandment .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	8	I say therefore to the unmarried and widows , it is good for them if they abide even as I .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they can not contain , let them marry : for it is better to marry than to burn .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	10	And unto the married I command , yet not I , but the Lord , Let not the wife depart from her husband :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	11	But and if she depart , let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband : and let not the husband put away his wife .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	12	But to the rest speak I , not the Lord : If any brother hath a wife that believeth not , and she be pleased to dwell with him , let him not put her away .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not , and if he be pleased to dwell with her , let her not leave him .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband : else were your children unclean ; but now are they holy .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbelieving depart , let him depart . A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases : but God hath called us to peace .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	16	For what knowest thou , O wife , whether thou shalt save thy husband ? or how knowest thou , O man , whether thou shalt save thy wife ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	17	But as God hath distributed to every man , as the Lord hath called every one , so let him walk . And so ordain I in all churches .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Is any man called being circumcised ? let him not become uncircumcised . Is any called in uncircumcision ? let him not be circumcised .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing , but the keeping of the commandments of God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Art thou called being a servant ? care not for it : but if thou mayest be made free , use it rather .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For he that is called in the Lord , being a servant , is the Lord 's freeman : likewise also he that is called , being free , is Christ 's servant .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	23	Ye are bought with a price ; be not ye the servants of men .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	24	Brethren , let every man , wherein he is called , therein abide with God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord : yet I give my judgment , as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress , I say , that it is good for a man so to be .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Art thou bound unto a wife ? seek not to be loosed . Art thou loosed from a wife ? seek not a wife .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But and if thou marry , thou hast not sinned ; and if a virgin marry , she hath not sinned . Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh : but I spare you .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	29	But this I say , brethren , the time is short : it remaineth , that both they that have wives be as though they had none ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	30	And they that weep , as though they wept not ; and they that rejoice , as though they rejoiced not ; and they that buy , as though they possessed not ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	31	And they that use this world , as not abusing it : for the fashion of this world passeth away .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	32	But I would have you without carefulness . He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord , how he may please the Lord :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world , how he may please his wife .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	34	There is difference also between a wife and a virgin . The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and in spirit : but she that is married careth for the things of the world , how she may please her husband .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	35	And this I speak for your own profit ; not that I may cast a snare upon you , but for that which is comely , and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	36	But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin , if she pass the flower of her age , and need so require , let him do what he will , he sinneth not : let them marry .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	37	Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart , having no necessity , but hath power over his own will , and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin , doeth well .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well ; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	39	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth ; but if her husband be dead , she is at liberty to be married to whom she will ; only in the Lord .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	7	40	But she is happier if she so abide , after my judgment : and I think also that I have the Spirit of God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	8	1	Corinthians
KJV	1%20Corinthians	8	8	But meat commendeth us not to God : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	8	2	And if any man think that he knoweth any thing , he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	8	3	But if any man love God , the same is known of him .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	8	4	As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols , we know that an idol is nothing in the world , and that there is none other God but one .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	8	5	For though there be that are called gods , whether in heaven or in earth , ( as there be gods many , and lords many , )
KJV	1%20Corinthians	8	6	But to us there is but one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we in him ; and one Lord Jesus Christ , by whom are all things , and we by him .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	8	7	Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge : for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol ; and their conscience being weak is defiled .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	8	9	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	8	10	For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol 's temple , shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	8	11	And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish , for whom Christ died ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	8	12	But when ye sin so against the brethren , and wound their weak conscience , ye sin against Christ .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	8	13	Wherefore , if meat make my brother to offend , I will eat no flesh while the world standeth , lest I make my brother to offend .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	1	Corinthians
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	9	For it is written in the law of Moses , thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn . Doth God take care for oxen ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	2	If I be not an apostle unto others , yet doubtless I am to you : for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	3	Mine answer to them that do examine me is this ,
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	4	Have we not power to eat and to drink ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	5	Have we not power to lead about a sister , a wife , as well as other apostles , and as the brethren of the Lord , and Cephas ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	6	Or I only and Barnabas , have not we power to forbear working ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	7	Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges ? who planteth a vineyard , and eateth not of the fruit thereof ? or who feedeth a flock , and eateth not of the milk of the flock ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	8	Say I these things as a man ? or saith not the law the same also ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	10	Or saith he it altogether for our sakes ? For our sakes , no doubt , this is written : that he that ploweth should plow in hope ; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	11	If we have sown unto you spiritual things , is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	12	If others be partakers of this power over you , are not we rather ? Nevertheless we have not used this power ; but suffer all things , lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	13	Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple ? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	14	Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	15	But I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my glorying void .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	16	For though I preach the gospel , I have nothing to glory of : for necessity is laid upon me ; yea , woe is unto me , if I preach not the gospel !
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	17	For if I do this thing willingly , I have a reward : but if against my will , a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	18	What is my reward then ? Verily that , when I preach the gospel , I may make the gospel of Christ without charge , that I abuse not my power in the gospel .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	19	For though I be free from all men , yet have I made myself servant unto all , that I might gain the more .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	20	And unto the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might gain the Jews ; to them that are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain them that are under the law ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	21	To them that are without law , as without law , ( being not without law to God , but under the law to Christ , ) that I might gain them that are without law .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	22	To the weak became I as weak , that I might gain the weak : I am made all things to all men , that I might by all means save some .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	23	And this I do for the gospel 's sake , that I might be partaker thereof with you .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	24	Know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ? So run , that ye may obtain .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	25	And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things . Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown ; but we an incorruptible .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	26	I therefore so run , not as uncertainly ; so fight I , not as one that beateth the air :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	9	27	But I keep under my body , and bring it into subjection : lest that by any means , when I have preached to others , I myself should be a castaway .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	1	Corinthians
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	10	Neither murmur ye , as some of them also murmured , and were destroyed of the destroyer .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	2	And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	3	And did all eat the same spiritual meat ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	4	And did all drink the same spiritual drink : for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them : and that Rock was Christ .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	5	But with many of them God was not well pleased : for they were overthrown in the wilderness .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	6	Now these things were our examples , to the intent we should not lust after evil things , as they also lusted .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	7	Neither be ye idolaters , as were some of them ; as it is written , The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	8	Neither let us commit fornication , as some of them committed , and fell in one day three and twenty thousand .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	9	Neither let us tempt Christ , as some of them also tempted , and were destroyed of serpents .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	11	Now all these things happened unto them for examples : and they are written for our admonition , upon whom the ends of the world are come .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	12	Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	13	There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man : but God is faithful , who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able ; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape , that ye may be able to bear it .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	14	Wherefore , my dearly beloved , flee from idolatry .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to wise men ; judge ye what I say .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	16	The cup of blessing which we bless , is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? The bread which we break , is it not the communion of the body of Christ ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	17	For we being many are one bread , and one body : for we are all partakers of that one bread .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Behold Israel after the flesh : are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	19	What say I then ? that the idol is any thing , or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	20	But I say , that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to devils , and not to God : and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	21	Ye can not drink the cup of the Lord , and the cup of devils : ye can not be partakers of the Lord 's table , and of the table of devils .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? are we stronger than he ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful for me , but all things are not expedient : all things are lawful for me , but all things edify not .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	24	Let no man seek his own , but every man another 's wealth .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	25	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles , that eat , asking no question for conscience sake :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	26	For the earth is the Lord 's , and the fulness thereof .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	27	If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast , and ye be disposed to go ; whatsoever is set before you , eat , asking no question for conscience sake .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	28	But if any man say unto you , this is offered in sacrifice unto idols , eat not for his sake that shewed it , and for conscience sake : for the earth is the Lord 's , and the fulness thereof :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	29	Conscience , I say , not thine own , but of the other : for why is my liberty judged of another man 's conscience ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	30	For if I by grace be a partaker , why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	31	Whether therefore ye eat , or drink , or whatsoever ye do , do all to the glory of God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	32	Give none offence , neither to the Jews , nor to the Gentiles , nor to the church of God :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	10	33	Even as I please all men in all things , not seeking mine own profit , but the profit of many , that they may be saved .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	1	Corinthians
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	11	Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman , neither the woman without the man , in the Lord .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you , brethren , that ye remember me in all things , and keep the ordinances , as I delivered them to you .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	3	But I would have you know , that the head of every man is Christ ; and the head of the woman is the man ; and the head of Christ is God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man praying or prophesying , having his head covered , dishonoureth his head .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	5	But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head : for that is even all one as if she were shaven .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	6	For if the woman be not covered , let her also be shorn : but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven , let her be covered .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	7	For a man indeed ought not to cover his head , forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	8	For the man is not of the woman : but the woman of the man .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	9	Neither was the man created for the woman ; but the woman for the man .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	10	For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	12	For as the woman is of the man , even so is the man also by the woman ; but all things of God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	13	Judge in yourselves : is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Doth not even nature itself teach you , that , if a man have long hair , it is a shame unto him ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman have long hair , it is a glory to her : for her hair is given her for a covering .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	16	But if any man seem to be contentious , we have no such custom , neither the churches of God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	17	Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not , that ye come together not for the better , but for the worse .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	18	For first of all , when ye come together in the church , I hear that there be divisions among you ; and I partly believe it .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	19	For there must be also heresies among you , that they which are approved may be made manifest among you .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	20	When ye come together therefore into one place , this is not to eat the Lord 's supper .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	21	For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper : and one is hungry , and another is drunken .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	22	What ? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in ? or despise ye the church of God , and shame them that have not ? what shall I say to you ? shall I praise you in this ? I praise you not .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	23	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you , that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	24	And when he had given thanks , he brake it , and said , Take , eat : this is my body , which is broken for you : this do in remembrance of me .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	25	After the same manner also he took the cup , when he had supped , saying , this cup is the new testament in my blood : this do ye , as oft as ye drink it , in remembrance of me .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For as often as ye eat this bread , and drink this cup , ye do shew the Lord 's death till he come .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	27	Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread , and drink this cup of the Lord , unworthily , shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	28	But let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of that bread , and drink of that cup .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	29	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily , eateth and drinketh damnation to himself , not discerning the Lord 's body .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	30	For this cause many are weak and sickly among you , and many sleep .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	31	For if we would judge ourselves , we should not be judged .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But when we are judged , we are chastened of the Lord , that we should not be condemned with the world .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	33	Wherefore , my brethren , when ye come together to eat , tarry one for another .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	11	34	And if any man hunger , let him eat at home ; that ye come not together unto condemnation . And the rest will I set in order when I come .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	1	Corinthians
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	12	For as the body is one , and hath many members , and all the members of that one body , being many , are one body : so also is Christ .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	2	Ye know that ye were Gentiles , carried away unto these dumb idols , even as ye were led .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	3	Wherefore I give you to understand , that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed : and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord , but by the Holy Ghost .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	4	Now there are diversities of gifts , but the same Spirit .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	5	And there are differences of administrations , but the same Lord .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	6	And there are diversities of operations , but it is the same God which worketh all in all .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	7	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	8	For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom ; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	9	To another faith by the same Spirit ; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	10	To another the working of miracles ; to another prophecy ; to another discerning of spirits ; to another divers kinds of tongues ; to another the interpretation of tongues :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	11	But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit , dividing to every man severally as he will .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body , whether we be Jews or Gentiles , whether we be bond or free ; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	14	For the body is not one member , but many .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	15	If the foot shall say , Because I am not the hand , I am not of the body ; is it therefore not of the body ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear shall say , Because I am not the eye , I am not of the body ; is it therefore not of the body ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , where were the hearing ? If the whole were hearing , where were the smelling ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body , as it hath pleased him .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	19	And if they were all one member , where were the body ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	20	But now are they many members , yet but one body .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	21	And the eye can not say unto the hand , I have no need of thee : nor again the head to the feet , I have no need of you .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	22	Nay , much more those members of the body , which seem to be more feeble , are necessary :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	23	And those members of the body , which we think to be less honourable , upon these we bestow more abundant honour ; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	24	For our comely parts have no need : but God hath tempered the body together , having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	25	That there should be no schism in the body ; but that the members should have the same care one for another .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	26	And whether one member suffer , all the members suffer with it ; or one member be honoured , all the members rejoice with it .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Now ye are the body of Christ , and members in particular .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	28	And God hath set some in the church , first apostles , secondarily prophets , thirdly teachers , after that miracles , then gifts of healings , helps , governments , diversities of tongues .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles ? are all prophets ? are all teachers ? are all workers of miracles ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	30	Have all the gifts of healing ? do all speak with tongues ? do all interpret ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	12	31	But covet earnestly the best gifts : and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	13	1	Corinthians
KJV	1%20Corinthians	13	13	And now abideth faith , hope , charity , these three ; but the greatest of these is charity .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	13	2	And though I have the gift of prophecy , and understand all mysteries , and all knowledge ; and though I have all faith , so that I could remove mountains , and have not charity , I am nothing .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	13	3	And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor , and though I give my body to be burned , and have not charity , it profiteth me nothing .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	13	4	Charity suffereth long , and is kind ; charity envieth not ; charity vaunteth not itself , is not puffed up ,
KJV	1%20Corinthians	13	5	Doth not behave itself unseemly , seeketh not her own , is not easily provoked , thinketh no evil ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	13	6	Rejoiceth not in iniquity , but rejoiceth in the truth ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	13	7	Beareth all things , believeth all things , hopeth all things , endureth all things .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	13	8	Charity never faileth : but whether there be prophecies , they shall fail ; whether there be tongues , they shall cease ; whether there be knowledge , it shall vanish away .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	13	9	For we know in part , and we prophesy in part .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	13	10	But when that which is perfect is come , then that which is in part shall be done away .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I spake as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child : but when I became a man , I put away childish things .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	13	12	For now we see through a glass , darkly ; but then face to face : now I know in part ; but then shall I know even as also I am known .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Corinthians
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	14	For if I pray in an unknown tongue , my spirit prayeth , but my understanding is unfruitful .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	2	For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men , but unto God : for no man understandeth him ; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification , and exhortation , and comfort .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	4	He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself ; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	5	I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied : for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues , except he interpret , that the church may receive edifying .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	6	Now , brethren , if I come unto you speaking with tongues , what shall I profit you , except I shall speak to you either by revelation , or by knowledge , or by prophesying , or by doctrine ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	7	And even things without life giving sound , whether pipe or harp , except they give a distinction in the sounds , how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound , who shall prepare himself to the battle ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	9	So likewise ye , except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye shall speak into the air .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and none of them is without signification .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	11	Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice , I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian , and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	12	Even so ye , forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts , seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	13	Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	15	What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also : I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	16	Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit , how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks , seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	17	For thou verily givest thanks well , but the other is not edified .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank my God , I speak with tongues more than ye all :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	19	Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding , that by my voice I might teach others also , than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brethren , be not children in understanding : howbeit in malice be ye children , but in understanding be men .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	21	In the law it is written , With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people ; and yet for all that will they not hear me , saith the Lord .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign , not to them that believe , but to them that believe not : but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not , but for them which believe .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	23	If therefore the whole church be come together into one place , and all speak with tongues , and there come in those that are unlearned , or unbelievers , will they not say that ye are mad ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy , and there come in one that believeth not , or one unlearned , he is convinced of all , he is judged of all :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	25	And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest ; and so falling down on his face he will worship God , and report that God is in you of a truth .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	26	How is it then , brethren ? when ye come together , every one of you hath a psalm , hath a doctrine , hath a tongue , hath a revelation , hath an interpretation . Let all things be done unto edifying .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	27	If any man speak in an unknown tongue , let it be by two , or at the most by three , and that by course ; and let one interpret .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	28	But if there be no interpreter , let him keep silence in the church ; and let him speak to himself , and to God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	29	Let the prophets speak two or three , and let the other judge .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	30	If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by , let the first hold his peace .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	31	For ye may all prophesy one by one , that all may learn , and all may be comforted .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	32	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	33	For God is not the author of confusion , but of peace , as in all churches of the saints .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	34	Let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	35	And if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the church .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	36	What ? came the word of God out from you ? or came it unto you only ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	37	If any man think himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	38	But if any man be ignorant , let him be ignorant .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	39	Wherefore , brethren , covet to prophesy , and forbid not to speak with tongues .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	14	40	Let all things be done decently and in order .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	1	Corinthians
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	15	Yea , and we are found false witnesses of God ; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ : whom he raised not up , if so be that the dead rise not .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	2	By which also ye are saved , if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you , unless ye have believed in vain .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	3	For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received , how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures ;
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	4	And that he was buried , and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	5	And that he was seen of Cephas , then of the twelve :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	6	After that , he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once ; of whom the greater part remain unto this present , but some are fallen asleep .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	7	After that , he was seen of James ; then of all the apostles .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	8	And last of all he was seen of me also , as of one born out of due time .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles , that am not meet to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God I am what I am : and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain ; but I laboured more abundantly than they all : yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	11	Therefore whether it were I or they , so we preach , and so ye believed .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead , how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	13	But if there be no resurrection of the dead , then is Christ not risen :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ be not risen , then is our preaching vain , and your faith is also vain .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead rise not , then is not Christ raised :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ be not raised , your faith is vain ; ye are yet in your sins .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	18	Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ , we are of all men most miserable .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But now is Christ risen from the dead , and become the firstfruits of them that slept .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	21	For since by man came death , by man came also the resurrection of the dead .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For as in Adam all die , even so in Christ shall all be made alive .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But every man in his own order : Christ the firstfruits ; afterward they that are Christ 's at his coming .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	24	Then cometh the end , when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God , even the Father ; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign , till he hath put all enemies under his feet .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	27	For he hath put all things under his feet . But when he saith all things are put under him , it is manifest that he is excepted , which did put all things under him .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him , then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him , that God may be all in all .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead , if the dead rise not at all ? why are they then baptized for the dead ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	30	And why stand we in jeopardy every hour ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	31	I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord , I die daily .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	32	If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus , what advantageth it me , if the dead rise not ? let us eat and drink ; for to morrow we die .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Be not deceived : evil communications corrupt good manners .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Awake to righteousness , and sin not ; for some have not the knowledge of God : I speak this to your shame .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But some man will say , How are the dead raised up ? and with what body do they come ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	36	Thou fool , that which thou sowest is not quickened , except it die :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	37	And that which thou sowest , thou sowest not that body that shall be , but bare grain , it may chance of wheat , or of some other grain :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	38	But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him , and to every seed his own body .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh : but there is one kind of flesh of men , another flesh of beasts , another of fishes , and another of birds .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	40	There are also celestial bodies , and bodies terrestrial : but the glory of the celestial is one , and the glory of the terrestrial is another .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars : for one star differeth from another star in glory .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	42	So also is the resurrection of the dead . It is sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonour ; it is raised in glory : it is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power :
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body . There is a natural body , and there is a spiritual body .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	45	And so it is written , The first man Adam was made a living soul ; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	46	Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual , but that which is natural ; and afterward that which is spiritual .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man is of the earth , earthy ; the second man is the Lord from heaven .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	48	As is the earthy , such are they also that are earthy : and as is the heavenly , such are they also that are heavenly .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	49	And as we have borne the image of the earthy , we shall also bear the image of the heavenly .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	50	Now this I say , brethren , that flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God ; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Behold , I shew you a mystery ; We shall not all sleep , but we shall all be changed ,
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	52	In a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trump : for the trumpet shall sound , and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and we shall be changed .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption , and this mortal must put on immortality .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	54	So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption , and this mortal shall have put on immortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed up in victory .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	55	O death , where is thy sting ? O grave , where is thy victory ?
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin ; and the strength of sin is the law .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God , which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	15	58	Therefore , my beloved brethren , be ye stedfast , unmoveable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	1	Corinthians
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	16	That ye submit yourselves unto such , and to every one that helpeth with us , and laboureth .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	2	Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store , as God hath prospered him , that there be no gatherings when I come .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	3	And when I come , whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters , them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	4	And if it be meet that I go also , they shall go with me .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	5	Now I will come unto you , when I shall pass through Macedonia : for I do pass through Macedonia .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	6	And it may be that I will abide , yea , and winter with you , that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	7	For I will not see you now by the way ; but I trust to tarry a while with you , if the Lord permit .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	8	But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	9	For a great door and effectual is opened unto me , and there are many adversaries .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	10	Now if Timotheus come , see that he may be with you without fear : for he worketh the work of the Lord , as I also do .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	11	Let no man therefore despise him : but conduct him forth in peace , that he may come unto me : for I look for him with the brethren .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	12	As touching our brother Apollos , I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have convenient time .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	13	Watch ye , stand fast in the faith , quit you like men , be strong .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	14	Let all your things be done with charity .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	15	I beseech you , brethren , ( ye know the house of Stephanas , that it is the firstfruits of Achaia , and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints , )
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	17	I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus : for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	18	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours : therefore acknowledge ye them that are such .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	19	The churches of Asia salute you . Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord , with the church that is in their house .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	20	All the brethren greet you . Greet ye one another with an holy kiss .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	21	The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	22	If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ , let him be Anathema Maranatha .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
KJV	1%20Corinthians	16	24	My love be with you all in Christ Jesus . Amen .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	2	Grace be to you and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , unto the church of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints which are in all Achaia :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	3	Blessed be God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies , and the God of all comfort ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	4	Who comforteth us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us , so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	6	And whether we be afflicted , it is for your consolation and salvation , which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer : or whether we be comforted , it is for your consolation and salvation .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	7	And our hope of you is stedfast , knowing , that as ye are partakers of the sufferings , so shall ye be also of the consolation .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	8	For we would not , brethren , have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia , that we were pressed out of measure , above strength , insomuch that we despaired even of life :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	9	But we had the sentence of death in ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God which raiseth the dead :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	10	Who delivered us from so great a death , and doth deliver : in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	11	Ye also helping together by prayer for us , that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	12	For our rejoicing is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity and godly sincerity , not with fleshly wisdom , but by the grace of God , we have had our conversation in the world , and more abundantly to you-ward .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we write none other things unto you , that what ye read or acknowledge ; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	14	As also ye have acknowledged us in part , that we are your rejoicing , even as ye also are our 's in the day of the Lord Jesus .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	15	And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before , that ye might have a second benefit ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	16	And to pass by you into Macedonia , and to come again out of Macedonia unto you , and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	17	When I therefore was thus minded , did I use lightness ? or the things that I purpose , do I purpose according to the flesh , that with me there should be yea yea , and nay nay ?
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	18	But as God is true , our word toward you was not yea and nay .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , who was preached among you by us , even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus , was not yea and nay , but in him was yea .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	20	For all the promises of God in him are yea , and in him Amen , unto the glory of God by us .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	21	Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ , and hath anointed us , is God ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	22	Who hath also sealed us , and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	23	Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul , that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	1	24	Not for that we have dominion over your faith , but are helpers of your joy : for by faith ye stand .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	2	2	For if I make you sorry , who is he then that maketh me glad , but the same which is made sorry by me ?
KJV	2%20Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote this same unto you , lest , when I came , I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	2	4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears ; not that ye should be grieved , but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	2	5	But if any have caused grief , he hath not grieved me , but in part : that I may not overcharge you all .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	2	6	Sufficient to such a man is this punishment , which was inflicted of many .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	2	7	So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him , and comfort him , lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	2	8	Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	2	9	For to this end also did I write , that I might know the proof of you , whether ye be obedient in all things .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	2	10	To whom ye forgive any thing , I forgive also : for if I forgave any thing , to whom I forgave it , for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	2	11	Lest Satan should get an advantage of us : for we are not ignorant of his devices .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	2	12	Furthermore , when I came to Troas to preach Christ 's gospel , and a door was opened unto me of the Lord ,
KJV	2%20Corinthians	2	13	I had no rest in my spirit , because I found not Titus my brother : but taking my leave of them , I went from thence into Macedonia .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	2	14	Now thanks be unto God , which always causeth us to triumph in Christ , and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	2	15	For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ , in them that are saved , and in them that perish :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	2	16	To the one we are the savour of death unto death ; and to the other the savour of life unto life . And who is sufficient for these things ?
KJV	2%20Corinthians	2	17	For we are not as many , which corrupt the word of God : but as of sincerity , but as of God , in the sight of God speak we in Christ .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	2	Ye are our epistle written in our hearts , known and read of all men :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	3	Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fleshy tables of the heart .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	4	And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves ; but our sufficiency is of God ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	6	Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament ; not of the letter , but of the spirit : for the letter killeth , but the spirit giveth life .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	7	But if the ministration of death , written and engraven in stones , was glorious , so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance ; which glory was to be done away :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	8	How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious ?
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	9	For if the ministration of condemnation be glory , much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	10	For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect , by reason of the glory that excelleth .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	11	For if that which is done away was glorious , much more that which remaineth is glorious .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	12	Seeing then that we have such hope , we use great plainness of speech :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	13	And not as Moses , which put a veil over his face , that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were blinded : for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament ; which vail is done away in Christ .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	15	But even unto this day , when Moses is read , the vail is upon their heart .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	16	Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord , the vail shall be taken away .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is that Spirit : and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	3	18	But we all , with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord , are changed into the same image from glory to glory , even as by the Spirit of the Lord .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	2	But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	4	In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not , lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ , who is the image of God , should shine unto them .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	3	But if our gospel be hid , it is hid to them that are lost :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	5	For we preach not ourselves , but Christ Jesus the Lord ; and ourselves your servants for Jesus ' sake .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	6	For God , who commanded the light to shine out of darkness , hath shined in our hearts , to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the excellency of the power may be of God , and not of us .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We are troubled on every side , yet not distressed ; we are perplexed , but not in despair ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	9	Persecuted , but not forsaken ; cast down , but not destroyed ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	10	Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	11	For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus ' sake , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	12	So then death worketh in us , but life in you .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	13	We having the same spirit of faith , according as it is written , I believed , and therefore have I spoken ; we also believe , and therefore speak ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	14	Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus , and shall present us with you .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	15	For all things are for your sakes , that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	16	For which cause we faint not ; but though our outward man perish , yet the inward man is renewed day by day .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	17	For our light affliction , which is but for a moment , worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	4	18	While we look not at the things which are seen , but at the things which are not seen : for the things which are seen are temporal ; but the things which are not seen are eternal .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	2	For in this we groan , earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	5	Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God , who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	3	If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	4	For we that are in this tabernacle do groan , being burdened : not for that we would be unclothed , but clothed upon , that mortality might be swallowed up of life .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	6	Therefore we are always confident , knowing that , whilst we are at home in the body , we are absent from the Lord :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	7	( For we walk by faith , not by sight : )
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	8	We are confident , I say , and willing rather to be absent from the body , and to be present with the Lord .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	9	Wherefore we labour , that , whether present or absent , we may be accepted of him .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	11	Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord , we persuade men ; but we are made manifest unto God ; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	12	For we commend not ourselves again unto you , but give you occasion to glory on our behalf , that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance , and not in heart .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	13	For whether we be beside ourselves , it is to God : or whether we be sober , it is for your cause .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	14	For the love of Christ constraineth us ; because we thus judge , that if one died for all , then were all dead :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	15	And that he died for all , that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves , but unto him which died for them , and rose again .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	16	Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh : yea , though we have known Christ after the flesh , yet now henceforth know we him no more .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	17	Therefore if any man be in Christ , he is a new creature : old things are passed away ; behold , all things are become new .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	18	And all things are of God , who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ , and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	19	To wit , that God was in Christ , reconciling the world unto himself , not imputing their trespasses unto them ; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	20	Now then we are ambassadors for Christ , as though God did beseech you by us : we pray you in Christ 's stead , be ye reconciled to God .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	5	21	For he hath made him to be sin for us , who knew no sin ; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	2	( For he saith , I have heard thee in a time accepted , and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee : behold , now is the accepted time ; behold , now is the day of salvation . )
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	6	By pureness , by knowledge , by long suffering , by kindness , by the Holy Ghost , by love unfeigned ,
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	3	Giving no offence in any thing , that the ministry be not blamed :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	4	But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God , in much patience , in afflictions , in necessities , in distresses ,
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	5	In stripes , in imprisonments , in tumults , in labours , in watchings , in fastings ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	7	By the word of truth , by the power of God , by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left ,
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	8	By honour and dishonour , by evil report and good report : as deceivers , and yet true ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	9	As unknown , and yet well known ; as dying , and , behold , we live ; as chastened , and not killed ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	10	As sorrowful , yet alway rejoicing ; as poor , yet making many rich ; as having nothing , and yet possessing all things .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	11	O ye Corinthians , our mouth is open unto you , our heart is enlarged .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	12	Ye are not straitened in us , but ye are straitened in your own bowels .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	13	Now for a recompence in the same , ( I speak as unto my children , ) be ye also enlarged .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	14	Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers : for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness ? and what communion hath light with darkness ?
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	15	And what concord hath Christ with Belial ? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel ?
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	16	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols ? for ye are the temple of the living God ; as God hath said , I will dwell in them , and walk in them ; and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	17	Wherefore come out from among them , and be ye separate , saith the Lord , and touch not the unclean thing ; and I will receive you .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	6	18	And will be a Father unto you , and ye shall be my sons and daughters , saith the Lord Almighty .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	7	2	Receive us ; we have wronged no man , we have corrupted no man , we have defrauded no man .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	7	7	And not by his coming only , but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you , when he told us your earnest desire , your mourning , your fervent mind toward me ; so that I rejoiced the more .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I speak not this to condemn you : for I have said before , that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	7	4	Great is my boldness of speech toward you , great is my glorying of you : I am filled with comfort , I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	7	5	For , when we were come into Macedonia , our flesh had no rest , but we were troubled on every side ; without were fightings , within were fears .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	7	6	Nevertheless God , that comforteth those that are cast down , comforted us by the coming of Titus ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	7	8	For though I made you sorry with a letter , I do not repent , though I did repent : for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry , though it were but for a season .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	7	9	Now I rejoice , not that ye were made sorry , but that ye sorrowed to repentance : for ye were made sorry after a godly manner , that ye might receive damage by us in nothing .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	7	10	For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of : but the sorrow of the world worketh death .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	7	11	For behold this selfsame thing , that ye sorrowed after a godly sort , what carefulness it wrought in you , yea , what clearing of yourselves , yea , what indignation , yea , what fear , yea , what vehement desire , yea , what zeal , yea , what revenge ! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	7	12	Wherefore , though I wrote unto you , I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong , nor for his cause that suffered wrong , but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	7	13	Therefore we were comforted in your comfort : yea , and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus , because his spirit was refreshed by you all .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	7	14	For if I have boasted any thing to him of you , I am not ashamed ; but as we spake all things to you in truth , even so our boasting , which I made before Titus , is found a truth .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	7	15	And his inward affection is more abundant toward you , whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all , how with fear and trembling ye received him .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	2	How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I speak not by commandment , but by occasion of the forwardness of others , and to prove the sincerity of your love .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	3	For to their power , I bear record , yea , and beyond their power they were willing of themselves ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	4	Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift , and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	5	And this they did , not as we hoped , but first gave their own selves to the Lord , and unto us by the will of God .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	6	Insomuch that we desired Titus , that as he had begun , so he would also finish in you the same grace also .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	7	Therefore , as ye abound in every thing , in faith , and utterance , and knowledge , and in all diligence , and in your love to us , see that ye abound in this grace also .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that ye through his poverty might be rich .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	10	And herein I give my advice : for this is expedient for you , who have begun before , not only to do , but also to be forward a year ago .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	11	Now therefore perform the doing of it ; that as there was a readiness to will , so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	12	For if there be first a willing mind , it is accepted according to that a man hath , and not according to that he hath not .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	13	For I mean not that other men be eased , and ye burdened :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	14	But by an equality , that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want , that their abundance also may be a supply for your want : that there may be equality :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	15	As it is written , He that had gathered much had nothing over ; and he that had gathered little had no lack .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	16	But thanks be to God , which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	17	For indeed he accepted the exhortation ; but being more forward , of his own accord he went unto you .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	18	And we have sent with him the brother , whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	19	And not that only , but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace , which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord , and declaration of your ready mind :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	20	Avoiding this , that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	21	Providing for honest things , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	22	And we have sent with them our brother , whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things , but now much more diligent , upon the great confidence which I have in you .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	23	Whether any do enquire of Titus , he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you : or our brethren be enquired of , they are the messengers of the churches , and the glory of Christ .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	8	24	Wherefore shew ye to them , and before the churches , the proof of your love , and of our boasting on your behalf .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	9	2	For I know the forwardness of your mind , for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia , that Achaia was ready a year ago ; and your zeal hath provoked very many .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	9	9	( As it is written , He hath dispersed abroad ; he hath given to the poor : his righteousness remaineth for ever .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	9	3	Yet have I sent the brethren , lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf ; that , as I said , ye may be ready :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	9	4	Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me , and find you unprepared , we ( that we say not , ye ) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	9	5	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren , that they would go before unto you , and make up beforehand your bounty , whereof ye had notice before , that the same might be ready , as a matter of bounty , and not as of covetousness .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	9	6	But this I say , He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly ; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Every man according as he purposeth in his heart , so let him give ; not grudgingly , or of necessity : for God loveth a cheerful giver .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to make all grace abound toward you ; that ye , always having all sufficiency in all things , may abound to every good work :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	9	10	Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food , and multiply your seed sown , and increase the fruits of your righteousness ; )
KJV	2%20Corinthians	9	11	Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness , which causeth through us thanksgiving to God .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	9	12	For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints , but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	9	13	Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ , and for your liberal distribution unto them , and unto all men ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	9	14	And by their prayer for you , which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	9	15	Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	2	But I beseech you , that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence , wherewith I think to be bold against some , which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	10	For his letters , say they , are weighty and powerful ; but his bodily presence is weak , and his speech contemptible .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh , we do not war after the flesh :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	4	( For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal , but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds ; )
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	5	Casting down imaginations , and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God , and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	6	And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience , when your obedience is fulfilled .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	7	Do ye look on things after the outward appearance ? if any man trust to himself that he is Christ 's , let him of himself think this again , that , as he is Christ 's , even so are we Christ 's .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	8	For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority , which the Lord hath given us for edification , and not for your destruction , I should not be ashamed :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	9	That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Let such an one think this , that , such as we are in word by letters when we are absent , such will we be also in deed when we are present .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	12	For we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	13	But we will not boast of things without our measure , but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us , a measure to reach even unto you .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure , as though we reached not unto you : for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	15	Not boasting of things without our measure , that is , of other men 's labours ; but having hope , when your faith is increased , that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly ,
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	16	To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you , and not to boast in another man 's line of things made ready to our hand .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	17	But he that glorieth , let him glory in the Lord .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	10	18	For not he that commendeth himself is approved , but whom the Lord commendeth .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	2	For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy : for I have espoused you to one husband , that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	11	Wherefore ? because I love you not ? God knoweth .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But I fear , lest by any means , as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty , so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	4	For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus , whom we have not preached , or if ye receive another spirit , which ye have not received , or another gospel , which ye have not accepted , ye might well bear with him .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	5	For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	6	But though I be rude in speech , yet not in knowledge ; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted , because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely ?
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches , taking wages of them , to do you service .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	9	And when I was present with you , and wanted , I was chargeable to no man : for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied : and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you , and so will I keep myself .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	10	As the truth of Christ is in me , no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	12	But what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion ; that wherein they glory , they may be found even as we .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	13	For such are false apostles , deceitful workers , transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	14	And no marvel ; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	15	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness ; whose end shall be according to their works .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I say again , let no man think me a fool ; if otherwise , yet as a fool receive me , that I may boast myself a little .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	17	That which I speak , I speak it not after the Lord , but as it were foolishly , in this confidence of boasting .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Seeing that many glory after the flesh , I will glory also .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	19	For ye suffer fools gladly , seeing ye yourselves are wise .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	20	For ye suffer , if a man bring you into bondage , if a man devour you , if a man take of you , if a man exalt himself , if a man smite you on the face .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	21	I speak as concerning reproach , as though we had been weak . Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold , ( I speak foolishly , ) I am bold also .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews ? so am I . Are they Israelites ? so am I . Are they the seed of Abraham ? so am I .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	23	Are they ministers of Christ ? ( I speak as a fool ) I am more ; in labours more abundant , in stripes above measure , in prisons more frequent , in deaths oft .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	24	Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Thrice was I beaten with rods , once was I stoned , thrice I suffered shipwreck , a night and a day I have been in the deep ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	26	In journeyings often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils by mine own countrymen , in perils by the heathen , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brethren ;
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	27	In weariness and painfulness , in watchings often , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , in cold and nakedness .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	28	Beside those things that are without , that which cometh upon me daily , the care of all the churches .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	29	Who is weak , and I am not weak ? who is offended , and I burn not ?
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	30	If I must needs glory , I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	31	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which is blessed for evermore , knoweth that I lie not .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	32	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the damascenes with a garrison , desirous to apprehend me :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	11	33	And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall , and escaped his hands .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	2	I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago , ( whether in the body , I can not tell ; or whether out of the body , I can not tell : God knoweth ; ) such an one caught up to the third heaven .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	12	Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience , in signs , and wonders , and mighty deeds .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	3	And I knew such a man , ( whether in the body , or out of the body , I can not tell : God knoweth ; )
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	4	How that he was caught up into paradise , and heard unspeakable words , which it is not lawful for a man to utter .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	5	Of such an one will I glory : yet of myself I will not glory , but in mine infirmities .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	6	For though I would desire to glory , I shall not be a fool ; for I will say the truth : but now I forbear , lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be , or that he heareth of me .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	7	And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations , there was given to me a thorn in the flesh , the messenger of Satan to buffet me , lest I should be exalted above measure .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	8	For this thing I besought the Lord thrice , that it might depart from me .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	9	And he said unto me , My grace is sufficient for thee : for my strength is made perfect in weakness . Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities , that the power of Christ may rest upon me .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	10	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities , in reproaches , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses for Christ 's sake : for when I am weak , then am I strong .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I am become a fool in glorying ; ye have compelled me : for I ought to have been commended of you : for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles , though I be nothing .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	13	For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches , except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you ? forgive me this wrong .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Behold , the third time I am ready to come to you ; and I will not be burdensome to you : for I seek not yours but you : for the children ought not to lay up for the parents , but the parents for the children .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	15	And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you ; though the more abundantly I love you , the less I be loved .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	16	But be it so , I did not burden you : nevertheless , being crafty , I caught you with guile .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	17	Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you ?
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I desired Titus , and with him I sent a brother . Did Titus make a gain of you ? walked we not in the same spirit ? walked we not in the same steps ?
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	19	Again , think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you ? we speak before God in Christ : but we do all things , dearly beloved , for your edifying .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	20	For I fear , lest , when I come , I shall not find you such as I would , and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not : lest there be debates , envyings , wraths , strifes , backbitings , whisperings , swellings , tumults :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	12	21	And lest , when I come again , my God will humble me among you , and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already , and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	13	2	I told you before , and foretell you , as if I were present , the second time ; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned , and to all other , that , if I come again , I will not spare :
KJV	2%20Corinthians	13	13	All the saints salute you .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	13	3	Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me , which to you-ward is not weak , but is mighty in you .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	13	4	For though he was crucified through weakness , yet he liveth by the power of God . For we also are weak in him , but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	13	5	Examine yourselves , whether ye be in the faith ; prove your own selves . Know ye not your own selves , how that Jesus Christ is in you , except ye be reprobates ?
KJV	2%20Corinthians	13	6	But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	13	7	Now I pray to God that ye do no evil ; not that we should appear approved , but that ye should do that which is honest , though we be as reprobates .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	13	8	For we can do nothing against the truth , but for the truth .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	13	9	For we are glad , when we are weak , and ye are strong : and this also we wish , even your perfection .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	13	10	Therefore I write these things being absent , lest being present I should use sharpness , according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification , and not to destruction .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	13	11	Finally , brethren , farewell . Be perfect , be of good comfort , be of one mind , live in peace ; and the God of love and peace shall be with you .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	13	12	Greet one another with an holy kiss .
KJV	2%20Corinthians	13	14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ , and the love of God , and the communion of the Holy Ghost , be with you all . Amen .
KJV	Galatians	1	1	Paul , an apostle , ( not of men , neither by man , but by Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who raised him from the dead ; )
KJV	Galatians	1	2	And all the brethren which are with me , unto the churches of Galatia :
KJV	Galatians	1	3	Grace be to you and peace from God the Father , and from our Lord Jesus Christ ,
KJV	Galatians	1	4	Who gave himself for our sins , that he might deliver us from this present evil world , according to the will of God and our Father :
KJV	Galatians	1	5	To whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
KJV	Galatians	1	6	I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel :
KJV	Galatians	1	7	Which is not another ; but there be some that trouble you , and would pervert the gospel of Christ .
KJV	Galatians	1	8	But though we , or an angel from heaven , preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you , let him be accursed .
KJV	Galatians	1	9	As we said before , so say I now again , if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received , let him be accursed .
KJV	Galatians	1	10	For do I now persuade men , or God ? or do I seek to please men ? for if I yet pleased men , I should not be the servant of Christ .
KJV	Galatians	1	11	But I certify you , brethren , that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man .
KJV	Galatians	1	12	For I neither received it of man , neither was I taught it , but by the revelation of Jesus Christ .
KJV	Galatians	1	13	For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God , and wasted it :
KJV	Galatians	1	14	And profited in the Jews ' religion above many my equals in mine own nation , being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers .
KJV	Galatians	1	15	But when it pleased God , who separated me from my mother 's womb , and called me by his grace ,
KJV	Galatians	1	16	To reveal his Son in me , that I might preach him among the heathen ; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood :
KJV	Galatians	1	17	Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me ; but I went into Arabia , and returned again unto Damascus .
KJV	Galatians	1	18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter , and abode with him fifteen days .
KJV	Galatians	1	19	But other of the apostles saw I none , save James the Lord 's brother .
KJV	Galatians	1	20	Now the things which I write unto you , behold , before God , I lie not .
KJV	Galatians	1	21	Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia ;
KJV	Galatians	1	22	And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ :
KJV	Galatians	1	23	But they had heard only , That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed .
KJV	Galatians	1	24	And they glorified God in me .
KJV	Galatians	2	2	And I went up by revelation , and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles , but privately to them which were of reputation , lest by any means I should run , or had run , in vain .
KJV	Galatians	2	3	But neither Titus , who was with me , being a Greek , was compelled to be circumcised :
KJV	Galatians	2	4	And that because of false brethren unawares brought in , who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus , that they might bring us into bondage :
KJV	Galatians	2	5	To whom we gave place by subjection , no , not for an hour ; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you .
KJV	Galatians	2	6	But of these who seemed to be somewhat , ( whatsoever they were , it maketh no matter to me : God accepteth no man 's person : ) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me :
KJV	Galatians	2	7	But contrariwise , when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me , as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter ;
KJV	Galatians	2	8	( For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision , the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles : )
KJV	Galatians	2	9	And when James , Cephas , and John , who seemed to be pillars , perceived the grace that was given unto me , they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship ; that we should go unto the heathen , and they unto the circumcision .
KJV	Galatians	2	10	Only they would that we should remember the poor ; the same which I also was forward to do .
KJV	Galatians	2	11	But when Peter was come to Antioch , I withstood him to the face , because he was to be blamed .
KJV	Galatians	2	12	For before that certain came from James , he did eat with the Gentiles : but when they were come , he withdrew and separated himself , fearing them which were of the circumcision .
KJV	Galatians	2	13	And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him ; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation .
KJV	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel , I said unto Peter before them all , If thou , being a Jew , livest after the manner of Gentiles , and not as do the Jews , why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews ?
KJV	Galatians	2	15	We who are Jews by nature , and not sinners of the Gentiles ,
KJV	Galatians	2	16	Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law , but by the faith of Jesus Christ , even we have believed in Jesus Christ , that we might be justified by the faith of Christ , and not by the works of the law : for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified .
KJV	Galatians	2	17	But if , while we seek to be justified by Christ , we ourselves also are found sinners , is therefore Christ the minister of sin ? God forbid .
KJV	Galatians	2	18	For if I build again the things which I destroyed , I make myself a transgressor .
KJV	Galatians	2	19	For I through the law am dead to the law , that I might live unto God .
KJV	Galatians	2	20	I am crucified with Christ : nevertheless I live ; yet not I , but Christ liveth in me : and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God , who loved me , and gave himself for me .
KJV	Galatians	2	21	I do not frustrate the grace of God : for if righteousness come by the law , then Christ is dead in vain .
KJV	Galatians	3	3	Are ye so foolish ? having begun in the Spirit , are ye now made perfect by the flesh ?
KJV	Galatians	3	2	This only would I learn of you , Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
KJV	Galatians	3	4	Have ye suffered so many things in vain ? if it be yet in vain .
KJV	Galatians	3	5	He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit , and worketh miracles among you , doeth he it by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
KJV	Galatians	3	6	Even as Abraham believed God , and it was accounted to him for righteousness .
KJV	Galatians	3	7	Know ye therefore that they which are of faith , the same are the children of Abraham .
KJV	Galatians	3	8	And the scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith , preached before the gospel unto Abraham , saying , In thee shall all nations be blessed .
KJV	Galatians	3	9	So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham .
KJV	Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse : for it is written , Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them .
KJV	Galatians	3	11	But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God , it is evident : for , The just shall live by faith .
KJV	Galatians	3	12	And the law is not of faith : but , The man that doeth them shall live in them .
KJV	Galatians	3	13	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law , being made a curse for us : for it is written , Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree :
KJV	Galatians	3	14	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .
KJV	Galatians	3	15	Brethren , I speak after the manner of men ; Though it be but a man 's covenant , yet if it be confirmed , no man disannulleth , or addeth thereto .
KJV	Galatians	3	16	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made . He saith not , And to seeds , as of many ; but as of one , And to thy seed , which is Christ .
KJV	Galatians	3	17	And this I say , that the covenant , that was confirmed before of God in Christ , the law , which was four hundred and thirty years after , can not disannul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
KJV	Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance be of the law , it is no more of promise : but God gave it to Abraham by promise .
KJV	Galatians	3	19	Wherefore then serveth the law ? It was added because of transgressions , till the seed should come to whom the promise was made ; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator .
KJV	Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator is not a mediator of one , but God is one .
KJV	Galatians	3	21	Is the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law .
KJV	Galatians	3	22	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin , that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe .
KJV	Galatians	3	23	But before faith came , we were kept under the law , shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed .
KJV	Galatians	3	24	Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
KJV	Galatians	3	25	But after that faith is come , we are no longer under a schoolmaster .
KJV	Galatians	3	26	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus .
KJV	Galatians	3	27	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ .
KJV	Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither bond nor free , there is neither male nor female : for ye are all one in Christ Jesus .
KJV	Galatians	3	29	And if ye be Christ 's , then are ye Abraham 's seed , and heirs according to the promise .
KJV	Galatians	4	4	But when the fulness of the time was come , God sent forth his Son , made of a woman , made under the law ,
KJV	Galatians	4	2	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father .
KJV	Galatians	4	3	Even so we , when we were children , were in bondage under the elements of the world :
KJV	Galatians	4	5	To redeem them that were under the law , that we might receive the adoption of sons .
KJV	Galatians	4	6	And because ye are sons , God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts , crying , Abba , Father .
KJV	Galatians	4	7	Wherefore thou art no more a servant , but a son ; and if a son , then an heir of God through Christ .
KJV	Galatians	4	8	Howbeit then , when ye knew not God , ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods .
KJV	Galatians	4	9	But now , after that ye have known God , or rather are known of God , how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements , whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage ?
KJV	Galatians	4	10	Ye observe days , and months , and times , and years .
KJV	Galatians	4	11	I am afraid of you , lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain .
KJV	Galatians	4	12	Brethren , I beseech you , be as I am ; for I am as ye are : ye have not injured me at all .
KJV	Galatians	4	13	Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first .
KJV	Galatians	4	14	And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not , nor rejected ; but received me as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus .
KJV	Galatians	4	15	Where is then the blessedness ye spake of ? for I bear you record , that , if it had been possible , ye would have plucked out your own eyes , and have given them to me .
KJV	Galatians	4	16	Am I therefore become your enemy , because I tell you the truth ?
KJV	Galatians	4	17	They zealously affect you , but not well ; yea , they would exclude you , that ye might affect them .
KJV	Galatians	4	18	But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing , and not only when I am present with you .
KJV	Galatians	4	19	My little children , of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you ,
KJV	Galatians	4	20	I desire to be present with you now , and to change my voice ; for I stand in doubt of you .
KJV	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , ye that desire to be under the law , do ye not hear the law ?
KJV	Galatians	4	22	For it is written , that Abraham had two sons , the one by a bondmaid , the other by a freewoman .
KJV	Galatians	4	23	But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh ; but he of the freewoman was by promise .
KJV	Galatians	4	24	Which things are an allegory : for these are the two covenants ; the one from the mount Sinai , which gendereth to bondage , which is Agar .
KJV	Galatians	4	25	For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia , and answereth to Jerusalem which now is , and is in bondage with her children .
KJV	Galatians	4	26	But Jerusalem which is above is free , which is the mother of us all .
KJV	Galatians	4	27	For it is written , Rejoice , thou barren that bearest not ; break forth and cry , thou that travailest not : for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband .
KJV	Galatians	4	28	Now we , brethren , as Isaac was , are the children of promise .
KJV	Galatians	4	29	But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit , even so it is now .
KJV	Galatians	4	30	Nevertheless what saith the scripture ? Cast out the bondwoman and her son : for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman .
KJV	Galatians	4	31	So then , brethren , we are not children of the bondwoman , but of the free .
KJV	Galatians	5	5	For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith .
KJV	Galatians	5	2	Behold , I Paul say unto you , that if ye be circumcised , Christ shall profit you nothing .
KJV	Galatians	5	3	For I testify again to every man that is circumcised , that he is a debtor to do the whole law .
KJV	Galatians	5	4	Christ is become of no effect unto you , whosoever of you are justified by the law ; ye are fallen from grace .
KJV	Galatians	5	6	For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing , nor uncircumcision ; but faith which worketh by love .
KJV	Galatians	5	7	Ye did run well ; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth ?
KJV	Galatians	5	8	This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you .
KJV	Galatians	5	9	A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump .
KJV	Galatians	5	10	I have confidence in you through the Lord , that ye will be none otherwise minded : but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment , whosoever he be .
KJV	Galatians	5	11	And I , brethren , if I yet preach circumcision , why do I yet suffer persecution ? then is the offence of the cross ceased .
KJV	Galatians	5	12	I would they were even cut off which trouble you .
KJV	Galatians	5	13	For , brethren , ye have been called unto liberty ; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh , but by love serve one another .
KJV	Galatians	5	14	For all the law is fulfilled in one word , even in this ; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
KJV	Galatians	5	15	But if ye bite and devour one another , take heed that ye be not consumed one of another .
KJV	Galatians	5	16	This I say then , Walk in the Spirit , and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh .
KJV	Galatians	5	17	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh : and these are contrary the one to the other : so that ye can not do the things that ye would .
KJV	Galatians	5	18	But if ye be led of the Spirit , ye are not under the law .
KJV	Galatians	5	19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest , which are these ; Adultery , fornication , uncleanness , lasciviousness ,
KJV	Galatians	5	20	Idolatry , witchcraft , hatred , variance , emulations , wrath , strife , seditions , heresies ,
KJV	Galatians	5	21	Envyings , murders , drunkenness , revellings , and such like : of the which I tell you before , as I have also told you in time past , that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God .
KJV	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , goodness , faith ,
KJV	Galatians	5	23	Meekness , temperance : against such there is no law .
KJV	Galatians	5	24	And they that are Christ 's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts .
KJV	Galatians	5	25	If we live in the Spirit , let us also walk in the Spirit .
KJV	Galatians	5	26	Let us not be desirous of vain glory , provoking one another , envying one another .
KJV	Galatians	6	6	Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things .
KJV	Galatians	6	2	Bear ye one another 's burdens , and so fulfil the law of Christ .
KJV	Galatians	6	3	For if a man think himself to be something , when he is nothing , he deceiveth himself .
KJV	Galatians	6	4	But let every man prove his own work , and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone , and not in another .
KJV	Galatians	6	5	For every man shall bear his own burden .
KJV	Galatians	6	7	Be not deceived ; God is not mocked : for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap .
KJV	Galatians	6	8	For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting .
KJV	Galatians	6	9	And let us not be weary in well doing : for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not .
KJV	Galatians	6	10	As we have therefore opportunity , let us do good unto all men , especially unto them who are of the household of faith .
KJV	Galatians	6	11	Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand .
KJV	Galatians	6	12	As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh , they constrain you to be circumcised ; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ .
KJV	Galatians	6	13	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law ; but desire to have you circumcised , that they may glory in your flesh .
KJV	Galatians	6	14	But God forbid that I should glory , save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom the world is crucified unto me , and I unto the world .
KJV	Galatians	6	15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing , nor uncircumcision , but a new creature .
KJV	Galatians	6	16	And as many as walk according to this rule , peace be on them , and mercy , and upon the Israel of God .
KJV	Galatians	6	17	From henceforth let no man trouble me : for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus .
KJV	Galatians	6	18	Brethren , the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
KJV	Ephesians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , to the saints which are at Ephesus , and to the faithful in Christ Jesus :
KJV	Ephesians	1	2	Grace be to you , and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	Ephesians	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ :
KJV	Ephesians	1	4	According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blame before him in love :
KJV	Ephesians	1	5	Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself , according to the good pleasure of his will ,
KJV	Ephesians	1	6	To the praise of the glory of his grace , wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved .
KJV	Ephesians	1	7	In whom we have redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of sins , according to the riches of his grace ;
KJV	Ephesians	1	8	Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence ;
KJV	Ephesians	1	9	Having made known unto us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself :
KJV	Ephesians	1	10	That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ , both which are in heaven , and which are on earth ; even in him :
KJV	Ephesians	1	11	In whom also we have obtained an inheritance , being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will :
KJV	Ephesians	1	12	That we should be to the praise of his glory , who first trusted in Christ .
KJV	Ephesians	1	13	In whom ye also trusted , after that ye heard the word of truth , the gospel of your salvation : in whom also after that ye believed , ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise ,
KJV	Ephesians	1	14	Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession , unto the praise of his glory .
KJV	Ephesians	1	15	Wherefore I also , after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus , and love unto all the saints ,
KJV	Ephesians	1	16	Cease not to give thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers ;
KJV	Ephesians	1	17	That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him :
KJV	Ephesians	1	18	The eyes of your understanding being enlightened ; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling , and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints ,
KJV	Ephesians	1	19	And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe , according to the working of his mighty power ,
KJV	Ephesians	1	20	Which he wrought in Christ , when he raised him from the dead , and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places ,
KJV	Ephesians	1	21	Far above all principality , and power , and might , and dominion , and every name that is named , not only in this world , but also in that which is to come :
KJV	Ephesians	1	22	And hath put all things under his feet , and gave him to be the head over all things to the church ,
KJV	Ephesians	1	23	Which is his body , the fulness of him that filleth all in all .
KJV	Ephesians	2	2	Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the air , the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience :
KJV	Ephesians	2	3	Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh , fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind ; and were by nature the children of wrath , even as others .
KJV	Ephesians	2	4	But God , who is rich in mercy , for his great love wherewith he loved us ,
KJV	Ephesians	2	5	Even when we were dead in sins , hath quickened us together with Christ , ( by grace ye are saved ; )
KJV	Ephesians	2	6	And hath raised us up together , and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus :
KJV	Ephesians	2	7	That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus .
KJV	Ephesians	2	8	For by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God :
KJV	Ephesians	2	9	Not of works , lest any man should boast .
KJV	Ephesians	2	10	For we are his workmanship , created in Christ Jesus unto good works , which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them .
KJV	Ephesians	2	11	Wherefore remember , that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh , who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands ;
KJV	Ephesians	2	12	That at that time ye were without Christ , being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel , and strangers from the covenants of promise , having no hope , and without God in the world :
KJV	Ephesians	2	13	But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ .
KJV	Ephesians	2	14	For he is our peace , who hath made both one , and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us ;
KJV	Ephesians	2	15	Having abolished in his flesh the enmity , even the law of commandments contained in ordinances ; for to make in himself of twain one new man , so making peace ;
KJV	Ephesians	2	16	And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross , having slain the enmity thereby :
KJV	Ephesians	2	17	And came and preached peace to you which were afar off , and to them that were nigh .
KJV	Ephesians	2	18	For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father .
KJV	Ephesians	2	19	Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners , but fellowcitizens with the saints , and of the household of God ;
KJV	Ephesians	2	20	And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone ;
KJV	Ephesians	2	21	In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord :
KJV	Ephesians	2	22	In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit .
KJV	Ephesians	3	3	How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery ; ( as I wrote afore in few words ,
KJV	Ephesians	3	2	If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward :
KJV	Ephesians	3	4	Whereby , when ye read , ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ )
KJV	Ephesians	3	5	Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men , as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit ;
KJV	Ephesians	3	6	That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs , and of the same body , and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel :
KJV	Ephesians	3	7	Whereof I was made a minister , according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power .
KJV	Ephesians	3	8	Unto me , who am less than the least of all saints , is this grace given , that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ ;
KJV	Ephesians	3	9	And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery , which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God , who created all things by Jesus Christ :
KJV	Ephesians	3	10	To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God ,
KJV	Ephesians	3	11	According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord :
KJV	Ephesians	3	12	In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him .
KJV	Ephesians	3	13	Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you , which is your glory .
KJV	Ephesians	3	14	For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
KJV	Ephesians	3	15	Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named ,
KJV	Ephesians	3	16	That he would grant you , according to the riches of his glory , to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man ;
KJV	Ephesians	3	17	That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith ; that ye , being rooted and grounded in love ,
KJV	Ephesians	3	18	May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth , and length , and depth , and height ;
KJV	Ephesians	3	19	And to know the love of Christ , which passeth knowledge , that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God .
KJV	Ephesians	3	20	Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think , according to the power that worketh in us ,
KJV	Ephesians	3	21	Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages , world without end . Amen .
KJV	Ephesians	4	4	There is one body , and one Spirit , even as ye are called in one hope of your calling ;
KJV	Ephesians	4	2	With all lowliness and meekness , with longsuffering , forbearing one another in love ;
KJV	Ephesians	4	3	Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace .
KJV	Ephesians	4	5	One Lord , one faith , one baptism ,
KJV	Ephesians	4	6	One God and Father of all , who is above all , and through all , and in you all .
KJV	Ephesians	4	7	But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ .
KJV	Ephesians	4	8	Wherefore he saith , When he ascended up on high , he led captivity captive , and gave gifts unto men .
KJV	Ephesians	4	9	( Now that he ascended , what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth ?
KJV	Ephesians	4	10	He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens , that he might fill all things . )
KJV	Ephesians	4	11	And he gave some , apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , evangelists ; and some , pastors and teachers ;
KJV	Ephesians	4	12	For the perfecting of the saints , for the work of the ministry , for the edifying of the body of Christ :
KJV	Ephesians	4	13	Till we all come in the unity of the faith , and of the knowledge of the Son of God , unto a perfect man , unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ :
KJV	Ephesians	4	14	That we henceforth be no more children , tossed to and fro , and carried about with every wind of doctrine , by the sleight of men , and cunning craftiness , whereby they lie in wait to deceive ;
KJV	Ephesians	4	15	But speaking the truth in love , may grow up into him in all things , which is the head , even Christ :
KJV	Ephesians	4	16	From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth , according to the effectual working in the measure of every part , maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love .
KJV	Ephesians	4	17	This I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk , in the vanity of their mind ,
KJV	Ephesians	4	18	Having the understanding darkened , being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them , because of the blindness of their heart :
KJV	Ephesians	4	19	Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness , to work all uncleanness with greediness .
KJV	Ephesians	4	20	But ye have not so learned Christ ;
KJV	Ephesians	4	21	If so be that ye have heard him , and have been taught by him , as the truth is in Jesus :
KJV	Ephesians	4	22	That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man , which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts ;
KJV	Ephesians	4	23	And be renewed in the spirit of your mind ;
KJV	Ephesians	4	24	And that ye put on the new man , which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness .
KJV	Ephesians	4	25	Wherefore putting away lying , speak every man truth with his neighbour : for we are members one of another .
KJV	Ephesians	4	26	Be ye angry , and sin not : let not the sun go down upon your wrath :
KJV	Ephesians	4	27	Neither give place to the devil .
KJV	Ephesians	4	28	Let him that stole steal no more : but rather let him labour , working with his hands the thing which is good , that he may have to give to him that needeth .
KJV	Ephesians	4	29	Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth , but that which is good to the use of edifying , that it may minister grace unto the hearers .
KJV	Ephesians	4	30	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God , whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption .
KJV	Ephesians	4	31	Let all bitterness , and wrath , and anger , and clamour , and evil speaking , be put away from you , with all malice :
KJV	Ephesians	4	32	And be ye kind one to another , tenderhearted , forgiving one another , even as God for Christ 's sake hath forgiven you .
KJV	Ephesians	5	5	For this ye know , that no whoremonger , nor unclean person , nor covetous man , who is an idolater , hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
KJV	Ephesians	5	2	And walk in love , as Christ also hath loved us , and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour .
KJV	Ephesians	5	3	But fornication , and all uncleanness , or covetousness , let it not be once named among you , as becometh saints ;
KJV	Ephesians	5	4	Neither filthiness , nor foolish talking , nor jesting , which are not convenient : but rather giving of thanks .
KJV	Ephesians	5	6	Let no man deceive you with vain words : for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience .
KJV	Ephesians	5	7	Be not ye therefore partakers with them .
KJV	Ephesians	5	8	For ye were sometimes darkness , but now are ye light in the Lord : walk as children of light :
KJV	Ephesians	5	9	( For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth ; )
KJV	Ephesians	5	10	Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord .
KJV	Ephesians	5	11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove them .
KJV	Ephesians	5	12	For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret .
KJV	Ephesians	5	13	But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light : for whatsoever doth make manifest is light .
KJV	Ephesians	5	14	Wherefore he saith , Awake thou that sleepest , and arise from the dead , and Christ shall give thee light .
KJV	Ephesians	5	15	See then that ye walk circumspectly , not as fools , but as wise ,
KJV	Ephesians	5	16	Redeeming the time , because the days are evil .
KJV	Ephesians	5	17	Wherefore be ye not unwise , but understanding what the will of the Lord is .
KJV	Ephesians	5	18	And be not drunk with wine , wherein is excess ; but be filled with the Spirit ;
KJV	Ephesians	5	19	Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
KJV	Ephesians	5	20	Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
KJV	Ephesians	5	21	Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God .
KJV	Ephesians	5	22	Wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as unto the Lord .
KJV	Ephesians	5	23	For the husband is the head of the wife , even as Christ is the head of the church : and he is the saviour of the body .
KJV	Ephesians	5	24	Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ , so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing .
KJV	Ephesians	5	25	Husbands , love your wives , even as Christ also loved the church , and gave himself for it ;
KJV	Ephesians	5	26	That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word ,
KJV	Ephesians	5	27	That he might present it to himself a glorious church , not having spot , or wrinkle , or any such thing ; but that it should be holy and without blemish .
KJV	Ephesians	5	28	So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies . He that loveth his wife loveth himself .
KJV	Ephesians	5	29	For no man ever yet hated his own flesh ; but nourisheth and cherisheth it , even as the Lord the church :
KJV	Ephesians	5	30	For we are members of his body , of his flesh , and of his bones .
KJV	Ephesians	5	31	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall be joined unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh .
KJV	Ephesians	5	32	This is a great mystery : but I speak concerning Christ and the church .
KJV	Ephesians	5	33	Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself ; and the wife see that she reverence her husband .
KJV	Ephesians	6	6	Not with eyeservice , as menpleasers ; but as the servants of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart ;
KJV	Ephesians	6	2	Honour thy father and mother ; which is the first commandment with promise ;
KJV	Ephesians	6	3	That it may be well with thee , and thou mayest live long on the earth .
KJV	Ephesians	6	4	And , ye fathers , provoke not your children to wrath : but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord .
KJV	Ephesians	6	5	Servants , be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto Christ ;
KJV	Ephesians	6	7	With good will doing service , as to the Lord , and not to men :
KJV	Ephesians	6	8	Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth , the same shall he receive of the Lord , whether he be bond or free .
KJV	Ephesians	6	9	And , ye masters , do the same things unto them , forbearing threatening : knowing that your Master also is in heaven ; neither is there respect of persons with him .
KJV	Ephesians	6	10	Finally , my brethren , be strong in the Lord , and in the power of his might .
KJV	Ephesians	6	11	Put on the whole armour of God , that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil .
KJV	Ephesians	6	12	For we wrestle not against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this world , against spiritual wickedness in high places .
KJV	Ephesians	6	13	Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God , that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day , and having done all , to stand .
KJV	Ephesians	6	14	Stand therefore , having your loins girt about with truth , and having on the breastplate of righteousness ;
KJV	Ephesians	6	15	And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace ;
KJV	Ephesians	6	16	Above all , taking the shield of faith , wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked .
KJV	Ephesians	6	17	And take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God :
KJV	Ephesians	6	18	Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit , and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints ;
KJV	Ephesians	6	19	And for me , that utterance may be given unto me , that I may open my mouth boldly , to make known the mystery of the gospel ,
KJV	Ephesians	6	20	For which I am an ambassador in bonds : that therein I may speak boldly , as I ought to speak .
KJV	Ephesians	6	21	But that ye also may know my affairs , and how I do , Tychicus , a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord , shall make known to you all things :
KJV	Ephesians	6	22	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that ye might know our affairs , and that he might comfort your hearts .
KJV	Ephesians	6	23	Peace be to the brethren , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	Ephesians	6	24	Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity . Amen .
KJV	Philippians	1	1	Paul and Timotheus , the servants of Jesus Christ , to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi , with the bishops and deacons :
KJV	Philippians	1	2	Grace be unto you , and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	Philippians	1	3	I thank my God upon every remembrance of you ,
KJV	Philippians	1	4	Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy ,
KJV	Philippians	1	5	For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now ;
KJV	Philippians	1	6	Being confident of this very thing , that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ :
KJV	Philippians	1	7	Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all , because I have you in my heart ; inasmuch as both in my bonds , and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel , ye all are partakers of my grace .
KJV	Philippians	1	8	For God is my record , how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ .
KJV	Philippians	1	9	And this I pray , that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment ;
KJV	Philippians	1	10	That ye may approve things that are excellent ; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ .
KJV	Philippians	1	11	Being filled with the fruits of righteousness , which are by Jesus Christ , unto the glory and praise of God .
KJV	Philippians	1	12	But I would ye should understand , brethren , that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel ;
KJV	Philippians	1	13	So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace , and in all other places ;
KJV	Philippians	1	14	And many of the brethren in the Lord , waxing confident by my bonds , are much more bold to speak the word without fear .
KJV	Philippians	1	15	Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife ; and some also of good will :
KJV	Philippians	1	16	The one preach Christ of contention , not sincerely , supposing to add affliction to my bonds :
KJV	Philippians	1	17	But the other of love , knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel .
KJV	Philippians	1	18	What then ? notwithstanding , every way , whether in pretence , or in truth , Christ is preached ; and I therein do rejoice , yea , and will rejoice .
KJV	Philippians	1	19	For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer , and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
KJV	Philippians	1	20	According to my earnest expectation and my hope , that in nothing I shall be ashamed , but that with all boldness , as always , so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body , whether it be by life , or by death .
KJV	Philippians	1	21	For to me to live is Christ , and to die is gain .
KJV	Philippians	1	22	But if I live in the flesh , this is the fruit of my labour : yet what I shall choose I wot not .
KJV	Philippians	1	23	For I am in a strait betwixt two , having a desire to depart , and to be with Christ ; which is far better :
KJV	Philippians	1	24	Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you .
KJV	Philippians	1	25	And having this confidence , I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith ;
KJV	Philippians	1	26	That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again .
KJV	Philippians	1	27	Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ : that whether I come and see you , or else be absent , I may hear of your affairs , that ye stand fast in one spirit , with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel ;
KJV	Philippians	1	28	And in nothing terrified by your adversaries : which is to them an evident token of perdition , but to you of salvation , and that of God .
KJV	Philippians	1	29	For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ , not only to believe on him , but also to suffer for his sake ;
KJV	Philippians	1	30	Having the same conflict which ye saw in me , and now hear to be in me .
KJV	Philippians	2	2	Fulfil ye my joy , that ye be likeminded , having the same love , being of one accord , of one mind .
KJV	Philippians	2	3	Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory ; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves .
KJV	Philippians	2	4	Look not every man on his own things , but every man also on the things of others .
KJV	Philippians	2	5	Let this mind be in you , which was also in Christ Jesus :
KJV	Philippians	2	6	Who , being in the form of God , thought it not robbery to be equal with God :
KJV	Philippians	2	7	But made himself of no reputation , and took upon him the form of a servant , and was made in the likeness of men :
KJV	Philippians	2	8	And being found in fashion as a man , he humbled himself , and became obedient unto death , even the death of the cross .
KJV	Philippians	2	9	Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him , and given him a name which is above every name :
KJV	Philippians	2	10	That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of things in heaven , and things in earth , and things under the earth ;
KJV	Philippians	2	11	And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
KJV	Philippians	2	12	Wherefore , my beloved , as ye have always obeyed , not as in my presence only , but now much more in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling .
KJV	Philippians	2	13	For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure .
KJV	Philippians	2	14	Do all things without murmurings and disputings :
KJV	Philippians	2	15	That ye may be blameless and harmless , the sons of God , without rebuke , in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation , among whom ye shine as lights in the world ;
KJV	Philippians	2	16	Holding forth the word of life ; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ , that I have not run in vain , neither laboured in vain .
KJV	Philippians	2	17	Yea , and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith , I joy , and rejoice with you all .
KJV	Philippians	2	18	For the same cause also do ye joy , and rejoice with me .
KJV	Philippians	2	19	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you , that I also may be of good comfort , when I know your state .
KJV	Philippians	2	20	For I have no man likeminded , who will naturally care for your state .
KJV	Philippians	2	21	For all seek their own , not the things which are Jesus Christ 's .
KJV	Philippians	2	22	But ye know the proof of him , that , as a son with the father , he hath served with me in the gospel .
KJV	Philippians	2	23	Him therefore I hope to send presently , so soon as I shall see how it will go with me .
KJV	Philippians	2	24	But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly .
KJV	Philippians	2	25	Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother , and companion in labour , and fellowsoldier , but your messenger , and he that ministered to my wants .
KJV	Philippians	2	26	For he longed after you all , and was full of heaviness , because that ye had heard that he had been sick .
KJV	Philippians	2	27	For indeed he was sick nigh unto death : but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
KJV	Philippians	2	28	I sent him therefore the more carefully , that , when ye see him again , ye may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
KJV	Philippians	2	29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness ; and hold such in reputation :
KJV	Philippians	2	30	Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death , not regarding his life , to supply your lack of service toward me .
KJV	Philippians	3	3	For we are the circumcision , which worship God in the spirit , and rejoice in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh .
KJV	Philippians	3	2	Beware of dogs , beware of evil workers , beware of the concision .
KJV	Philippians	3	4	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh . If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh , I more :
KJV	Philippians	3	5	Circumcised the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , an Hebrew of the Hebrews ; as touching the law , a Pharisee ;
KJV	Philippians	3	6	Concerning zeal , persecuting the church ; touching the righteousness which is in the law , blameless .
KJV	Philippians	3	7	But what things were gain to me , those I counted loss for Christ .
KJV	Philippians	3	8	Yea doubtless , and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord : for whom I have suffered the loss of all things , and do count them but dung , that I may win Christ ,
KJV	Philippians	3	9	And be found in him , not having mine own righteousness , which is of the law , but that which is through the faith of Christ , the righteousness which is of God by faith :
KJV	Philippians	3	10	That I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , being made conformable unto his death ;
KJV	Philippians	3	11	If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead .
KJV	Philippians	3	12	Not as though I had already attained , either were already perfect : but I follow after , if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus .
KJV	Philippians	3	13	Brethren , I count not myself to have apprehended : but this one thing I do , forgetting those things which are behind , and reaching forth unto those things which are before ,
KJV	Philippians	3	14	I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus .
KJV	Philippians	3	15	Let us therefore , as many as be perfect , be thus minded : and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded , God shall reveal even this unto you .
KJV	Philippians	3	16	Nevertheless , whereto we have already attained , let us walk by the same rule , let us mind the same thing .
KJV	Philippians	3	17	Brethren , be followers together of me , and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample .
KJV	Philippians	3	18	( For many walk , of whom I have told you often , and now tell you even weeping , that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ :
KJV	Philippians	3	19	Whose end is destruction , whose God is their belly , and whose glory is in their shame , who mind earthly things . )
KJV	Philippians	3	20	For our conversation is in heaven ; from whence also we look for the Saviour , the Lord Jesus Christ :
KJV	Philippians	3	21	Who shall change our vile body , that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body , according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself .
KJV	Philippians	4	4	Rejoice in the Lord always : and again I say , Rejoice .
KJV	Philippians	4	2	I beseech Euodias , and beseech Syntyche , that they be of the same mind in the Lord .
KJV	Philippians	4	3	And I intreat thee also , true yokefellow , help those women which laboured with me in the gospel , with Clement also , and with other my fellowlabourers , whose names are in the book of life .
KJV	Philippians	4	5	Let your moderation be known unto all men . The Lord is at hand .
KJV	Philippians	4	6	Be careful for nothing ; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God .
KJV	Philippians	4	7	And the peace of God , which passeth all understanding , shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus .
KJV	Philippians	4	8	Finally , brethren , whatsoever things are true , whatsoever things are honest , whatsoever things are just , whatsoever things are pure , whatsoever things are lovely , whatsoever things are of good report ; if there be any virtue , and if there be any praise , think on these things .
KJV	Philippians	4	9	Those things , which ye have both learned , and received , and heard , and seen in me , do : and the God of peace shall be with you .
KJV	Philippians	4	10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly , that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again ; wherein ye were also careful , but ye lacked opportunity .
KJV	Philippians	4	11	Not that I speak in respect of want : for I have learned , in whatsoever state I am , therewith to be content .
KJV	Philippians	4	12	I know both how to be abased , and I know how to abound : every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry , both to abound and to suffer need .
KJV	Philippians	4	13	I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me .
KJV	Philippians	4	14	Notwithstanding ye have well done , that ye did communicate with my affliction .
KJV	Philippians	4	15	Now ye Philippians know also , that in the beginning of the gospel , when I departed from Macedonia , no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving , but ye only .
KJV	Philippians	4	16	For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity .
KJV	Philippians	4	17	Not because I desire a gift : but I desire fruit that may abound to your account .
KJV	Philippians	4	18	But I have all , and abound : I am full , having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you , an odour of a sweet smell , a sacrifice acceptable , wellpleasing to God .
KJV	Philippians	4	19	But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus .
KJV	Philippians	4	20	Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
KJV	Philippians	4	21	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus . The brethren which are with me greet you .
KJV	Philippians	4	22	All the saints salute you , chiefly they that are of Caesar 's household .
KJV	Philippians	4	23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
KJV	Colossians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timotheus our brother ,
KJV	Colossians	1	2	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse : Grace be unto you , and peace , from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	Colossians	1	3	We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
KJV	Colossians	1	4	Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love which ye have to all the saints ,
KJV	Colossians	1	5	For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven , whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel ;
KJV	Colossians	1	6	Which is come unto you , as it is in all the world ; and bringeth forth fruit , as it doth also in you , since the day ye heard of it , and knew the grace of God in truth :
KJV	Colossians	1	7	As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant , who is for you a faithful minister of Christ ;
KJV	Colossians	1	8	Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit .
KJV	Colossians	1	9	For this cause we also , since the day we heard it , do not cease to pray for you , and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding ;
KJV	Colossians	1	10	That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing , being fruitful in every good work , and increasing in the knowledge of God ;
KJV	Colossians	1	11	Strengthened with all might , according to his glorious power , unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness ;
KJV	Colossians	1	12	Giving thanks unto the Father , which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light :
KJV	Colossians	1	13	Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness , and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son :
KJV	Colossians	1	14	In whom we have redemption through his blood , even the forgiveness of sins :
KJV	Colossians	1	15	Who is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn of every creature :
KJV	Colossians	1	16	For by him were all things created , that are in heaven , and that are in earth , visible and invisible , whether they be thrones , or dominions , or principalities , or powers : all things were created by him , and for him :
KJV	Colossians	1	17	And he is before all things , and by him all things consist .
KJV	Colossians	1	18	And he is the head of the body , the church : who is the beginning , the firstborn from the dead ; that in all things he might have the preeminence .
KJV	Colossians	1	19	For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell ;
KJV	Colossians	1	20	And , having made peace through the blood of his cross , by him to reconcile all things unto himself ; by him , I say , whether they be things in earth , or things in heaven .
KJV	Colossians	1	21	And you , that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works , yet now hath he reconciled
KJV	Colossians	1	22	In the body of his flesh through death , to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight :
KJV	Colossians	1	23	If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled , and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel , which ye have heard , and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven ; whereof I Paul am made a minister ;
KJV	Colossians	1	24	Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you , and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body 's sake , which is the church :
KJV	Colossians	1	25	Whereof I am made a minister , according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you , to fulfil the word of God ;
KJV	Colossians	1	26	Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations , but now is made manifest to his saints :
KJV	Colossians	1	27	To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles ; which is Christ in you , the hope of glory :
KJV	Colossians	1	28	Whom we preach , warning every man , and teaching every man in all wisdom ; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus :
KJV	Colossians	1	29	Whereunto I also labour , striving according to his working , which worketh in me mightily .
KJV	Colossians	2	2	That their hearts might be comforted , being knit together in love , and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding , to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God , and of the Father , and of Christ ;
KJV	Colossians	2	3	In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
KJV	Colossians	2	4	And this I say , lest any man should beguile you with enticing words .
KJV	Colossians	2	5	For though I be absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , joying and beholding your order , and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ .
KJV	Colossians	2	6	As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord , so walk ye in him :
KJV	Colossians	2	7	Rooted and built up in him , and stablished in the faith , as ye have been taught , abounding therein with thanksgiving .
KJV	Colossians	2	8	Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit , after the tradition of men , after the rudiments of the world , and not after Christ .
KJV	Colossians	2	9	For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily .
KJV	Colossians	2	10	And ye are complete in him , which is the head of all principality and power :
KJV	Colossians	2	11	In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands , in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ :
KJV	Colossians	2	12	Buried with him in baptism , wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God , who hath raised him from the dead .
KJV	Colossians	2	13	And you , being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh , hath he quickened together with him , having forgiven you all trespasses ;
KJV	Colossians	2	14	Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us , which was contrary to us , and took it out of the way , nailing it to his cross ;
KJV	Colossians	2	15	And having spoiled principalities and powers , he made a shew of them openly , triumphing over them in it .
KJV	Colossians	2	16	Let no man therefore judge you in meat , or in drink , or in respect of an holyday , or of the new moon , or of the sabbath days :
KJV	Colossians	2	17	Which are a shadow of things to come ; but the body is of Christ .
KJV	Colossians	2	18	Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels , intruding into those things which he hath not seen , vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind ,
KJV	Colossians	2	19	And not holding the Head , from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered , and knit together , increaseth with the increase of God .
KJV	Colossians	2	20	Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world , why , as though living in the world , are ye subject to ordinances ,
KJV	Colossians	2	21	( Touch not ; taste not ; handle not ;
KJV	Colossians	2	22	Which all are to perish with the using ; ) after the commandments and doctrines of men ?
KJV	Colossians	2	23	Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship , and humility , and neglecting of the body : not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh .
KJV	Colossians	3	3	For ye are dead , and your life is hid with Christ in God .
KJV	Colossians	3	2	Set your affection on things above , not on things on the earth .
KJV	Colossians	3	4	When Christ , who is our life , shall appear , then shall ye also appear with him in glory .
KJV	Colossians	3	5	Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth ; fornication , uncleanness , inordinate affection , evil concupiscence , and covetousness , which is idolatry :
KJV	Colossians	3	6	For which things ' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience :
KJV	Colossians	3	7	In the which ye also walked some time , when ye lived in them .
KJV	Colossians	3	8	But now ye also put off all these ; anger , wrath , malice , blasphemy , filthy communication out of your mouth .
KJV	Colossians	3	9	Lie not one to another , seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds ;
KJV	Colossians	3	10	And have put on the new man , which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him :
KJV	Colossians	3	11	Where there is neither Greek nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , Barbarian , Scythian , bond nor free : but Christ is all , and in all .
KJV	Colossians	3	12	Put on therefore , as the elect of God , holy and beloved , bowels of mercies , kindness , humbleness of mind , meekness , longsuffering ;
KJV	Colossians	3	13	Forbearing one another , and forgiving one another , if any man have a quarrel against any : even as Christ forgave you , so also do ye .
KJV	Colossians	3	14	And above all these things put on charity , which is the bond of perfectness .
KJV	Colossians	3	15	And let the peace of God rule in your hearts , to the which also ye are called in one body ; and be ye thankful .
KJV	Colossians	3	16	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom ; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord .
KJV	Colossians	3	17	And whatsoever ye do in word or deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God and the Father by him .
KJV	Colossians	3	18	Wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as it is fit in the Lord .
KJV	Colossians	3	19	Husbands , love your wives , and be not bitter against them .
KJV	Colossians	3	20	Children , obey your parents in all things : for this is well pleasing unto the Lord .
KJV	Colossians	3	21	Fathers , provoke not your children to anger , lest they be discouraged .
KJV	Colossians	3	22	Servants , obey in all things your masters according to the flesh ; not with eyeservice , as menpleasers ; but in singleness of heart , fearing God ;
KJV	Colossians	3	23	And whatsoever ye do , do it heartily , as to the Lord , and not unto men ;
KJV	Colossians	3	24	Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance : for ye serve the Lord Christ .
KJV	Colossians	3	25	But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done : and there is no respect of persons .
KJV	Colossians	4	4	That I may make it manifest , as I ought to speak .
KJV	Colossians	4	2	Continue in prayer , and watch in the same with thanksgiving ;
KJV	Colossians	4	3	Withal praying also for us , that God would open unto us a door of utterance , to speak the mystery of Christ , for which I am also in bonds :
KJV	Colossians	4	5	Walk in wisdom toward them that are without , redeeming the time .
KJV	Colossians	4	6	Let your speech be always with grace , seasoned with salt , that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man .
KJV	Colossians	4	7	All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you , who is a beloved brother , and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord :
KJV	Colossians	4	8	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that he might know your estate , and comfort your hearts ;
KJV	Colossians	4	9	With Onesimus , a faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . They shall make known unto you all things which are done here .
KJV	Colossians	4	10	Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you , and Marcus , sister 's son to Barnabas , ( touching whom ye received commandments : if he come unto you , receive him ; )
KJV	Colossians	4	11	And Jesus , which is called Justus , who are of the circumcision . These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God , which have been a comfort unto me .
KJV	Colossians	4	12	Epaphras , who is one of you , a servant of Christ , saluteth you , always labouring fervently for you in prayers , that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God .
KJV	Colossians	4	13	For I bear him record , that he hath a great zeal for you , and them that are in Laodicea , and them in Hierapolis .
KJV	Colossians	4	14	Luke , the beloved physician , and Demas , greet you .
KJV	Colossians	4	15	Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea , and Nymphas , and the church which is in his house .
KJV	Colossians	4	16	And when this epistle is read among you , cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans ; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea .
KJV	Colossians	4	17	And say to Archippus , Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord , that thou fulfil it .
KJV	Colossians	4	18	The salutation by the hand of me Paul . Remember my bonds . Grace be with you . Amen .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	1	Paul , and Silvanus , and Timotheus , unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ : Grace be unto you , and peace , from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	2	We give thanks to God always for you all , making mention of you in our prayers ;
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	3	Remembering without ceasing your work of faith , and labour of love , and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ , in the sight of God and our Father ;
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	4	Knowing , brethren beloved , your election of God .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	5	For our gospel came not unto you in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy Ghost , and in much assurance ; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	6	And ye became followers of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much affliction , with joy of the Holy Ghost .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	7	So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	8	For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia , but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad ; so that we need not to speak any thing .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	9	For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you , and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God ;
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	1	10	And to wait for his Son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead , even Jesus , which delivered us from the wrath to come .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	1	Thessalonians
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	2	But even after that we had suffered before , and were shamefully entreated , as ye know , at Philippi , we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	For our exhortation was not of deceit , nor of uncleanness , nor in guile :
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	4	But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel , even so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but God , which trieth our hearts .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	5	For neither at any time used we flattering words , as ye know , nor a cloke of covetousness ; God is witness :
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	6	Nor of men sought we glory , neither of you , nor yet of others , when we might have been burdensome , as the apostles of Christ .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	7	But we were gentle among you , even as a nurse cherisheth her children :
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	8	So being affectionately desirous of you , we were willing to have imparted unto you , not the gospel of God only , but also our own souls , because ye were dear unto us .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	9	For ye remember , brethren , our labour and travail : for labouring night and day , because we would not be chargeable unto any of you , we preached unto you the gospel of God .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	10	Ye are witnesses , and God also , how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe :
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	11	As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you , as a father doth his children ,
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	12	That ye would walk worthy of God , who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	13	For this cause also thank we God without ceasing , because , when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us , ye received it not as the word of men , but as it is in truth , the word of God , which effectually worketh also in you that believe .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	14	For ye , brethren , became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus : for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen , even as they have of the Jews :
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	15	Who both killed the Lord Jesus , and their own prophets , and have persecuted us ; and they please not God , and are contrary to all men :
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	16	Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved , to fill up their sins alway : for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	17	But we , brethren , being taken from you for a short time in presence , not in heart , endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	18	Wherefore we would have come unto you , even I Paul , once and again ; but Satan hindered us .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	19	For what is our hope , or joy , or crown of rejoicing ? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming ?
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	2	20	For ye are our glory and joy .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	1	Thessalonians
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	3	That no man should be moved by these afflictions : for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	2	And sent Timotheus , our brother , and minister of God , and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ , to establish you , and to comfort you concerning your faith :
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	4	For verily , when we were with you , we told you before that we should suffer tribulation ; even as it came to pass , and ye know .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	5	For this cause , when I could no longer forbear , I sent to know your faith , lest by some means the tempter have tempted you , and our labour be in vain .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	6	But now when Timotheus came from you unto us , and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity , and that ye have good remembrance of us always , desiring greatly to see us , as we also to see you :
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	7	Therefore , brethren , we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith :
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	8	For now we live , if ye stand fast in the Lord .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	9	For what thanks can we render to God again for you , for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God ;
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	10	Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face , and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith ?
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	11	Now God himself and our Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way unto you .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	12	And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we do toward you :
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	3	13	To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God , even our Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	1	Thessalonians
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	4	That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour ;
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	2	For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	3	For this is the will of God , even your sanctification , that ye should abstain from fornication :
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	5	Not in the lust of concupiscence , even as the Gentiles which know not God :
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	6	That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter : because that the Lord is the avenger of all such , as we also have forewarned you and testified .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	7	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness , but unto holiness .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	8	He therefore that despiseth , despiseth not man , but God , who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	9	But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you : for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	10	And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia : but we beseech you , brethren , that ye increase more and more ;
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	11	And that ye study to be quiet , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , as we commanded you ;
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	12	That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without , and that ye may have lack of nothing .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	13	But I would not have you to be ignorant , brethren , concerning them which are asleep , that ye sorrow not , even as others which have no hope .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again , even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	15	For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord , that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	16	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with the trump of God : and the dead in Christ shall rise first :
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	17	Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air : and so shall we ever be with the Lord .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	4	18	Wherefore comfort one another with these words .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	1	Thessalonians
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	5	Ye are all the children of light , and the children of the day : we are not of the night , nor of darkness .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	2	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	3	For when they shall say , Peace and safety ; then sudden destruction cometh upon them , as travail upon a woman with child ; and they shall not escape .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	4	But ye , brethren , are not in darkness , that that day should overtake you as a thief .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	6	Therefore let us not sleep , as do others ; but let us watch and be sober .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	7	For they that sleep sleep in the night ; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	8	But let us , who are of the day , be sober , putting on the breastplate of faith and love ; and for an helmet , the hope of salvation .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	9	For God hath not appointed us to wrath , but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ ,
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	10	Who died for us , that , whether we wake or sleep , we should live together with him .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	11	Wherefore comfort yourselves together , and edify one another , even as also ye do .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	12	And we beseech you , brethren , to know them which labour among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admonish you ;
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	13	And to esteem them very highly in love for their work 's sake . And be at peace among yourselves .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	14	Now we exhort you , brethren , warn them that are unruly , comfort the feebleminded , support the weak , be patient toward all men .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	15	See that none render evil for evil unto any man ; but ever follow that which is good , both among yourselves , and to all men .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	16	Rejoice evermore .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	17	Pray without ceasing .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	18	In every thing give thanks : for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	19	Quench not the Spirit .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	20	Despise not prophesyings .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	21	Prove all things ; hold fast that which is good .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	22	Abstain from all appearance of evil .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	23	And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly ; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	24	Faithful is he that calleth you , who also will do it .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	25	Brethren , pray for us .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	26	Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	27	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren .
KJV	1%20Thessalonians	5	28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . Amen .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	2	Grace unto you , and peace , from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	1	Paul , and Silvanus , and Timotheus , unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	3	We are bound to thank God always for you , brethren , as it is meet , because that your faith groweth exceedingly , and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth ;
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	4	So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure :
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	5	Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God , that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God , for which ye also suffer :
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	6	Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you ;
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	7	And to you who are troubled rest with us , when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels ,
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	8	In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God , and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ :
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	9	Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord , and from the glory of his power ;
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	10	When he shall come to be glorified in his saints , and to be admired in all them that believe ( because our testimony among you was believed ) in that day .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	11	Wherefore also we pray always for you , that our God would count you worthy of this calling , and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness , and the work of faith with power :
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	1	12	That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you , and ye in him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	2	That ye be not soon shaken in mind , or be troubled , neither by spirit , nor by word , nor by letter as from us , as that the day of Christ is at hand .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	3	Let no man deceive you by any means : for that day shall not come , except there come a falling away first , and that man of sin be revealed , the son of perdition ;
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	4	Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God , or that is worshipped ; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God , shewing himself that he is God .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	5	Remember ye not , that , when I was yet with you , I told you these things ?
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	6	And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	7	For the mystery of iniquity doth already work : only he who now letteth will let , until he be taken out of the way .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	8	And then shall that Wicked be revealed , whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth , and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming :
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	9	Even him , whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders ,
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	10	And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish ; because they received not the love of the truth , that they might be saved .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	11	And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion , that they should believe a lie :
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	12	That they all might be damned who believed not the truth , but had pleasure in unrighteousness .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	13	But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you , brethren beloved of the Lord , because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth :
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	14	Whereunto he called you by our gospel , to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	15	Therefore , brethren , stand fast , and hold the traditions which ye have been taught , whether by word , or our epistle .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	16	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and God , even our Father , which hath loved us , and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace ,
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	2	17	Comfort your hearts , and stablish you in every good word and work .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	2	And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men : for all men have not faith .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	3	But the Lord is faithful , who shall stablish you , and keep you from evil .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	4	And we have confidence in the Lord touching you , that ye both do and will do the things which we command you .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	5	And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God , and into the patient waiting for Christ .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	6	Now we command you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly , and not after the tradition which he received of us .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	7	For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us : for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you ;
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	8	Neither did we eat any man 's bread for nought ; but wrought with labour and travail night and day , that we might not be chargeable to any of you :
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	9	Not because we have not power , but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	10	For even when we were with you , this we commanded you , that if any would not work , neither should he eat .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	11	For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly , working not at all , but are busybodies .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	12	Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	13	But ye , brethren , be not weary in well doing .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	14	And if any man obey not our word by this epistle , note that man , and have no company with him , that he may be ashamed .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	15	Yet count him not as an enemy , but admonish him as a brother .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	16	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means . The Lord be with you all .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	17	The salutation of Paul with mine own hand , which is the token in every epistle : so I write .
KJV	2%20Thessalonians	3	18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour , and Lord Jesus Christ , which is our hope ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	2	Unto Timothy , my own son in the faith : Grace , mercy , and peace , from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord .
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	3	As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus , when I went into Macedonia , that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine ,
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	4	Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies , which minister questions , rather than godly edifying which is in faith : so do .
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	5	Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart , and of a good conscience , and of faith unfeigned :
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	6	From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	7	Desiring to be teachers of the law ; understanding neither what they say , nor whereof they affirm .
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	8	But we know that the law is good , if a man use it lawfully ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	9	Knowing this , that the law is not made for a righteous man , but for the lawless and disobedient , for the ungodly and for sinners , for unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	10	For whoremongers , for them that defile themselves with mankind , for menstealers , for liars , for perjured persons , and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	11	According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God , which was committed to my trust .
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	12	And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who hath enabled me , for that he counted me faithful , putting me into the ministry ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	13	Who was before a blasphemer , and a persecutor , and injurious : but I obtained mercy , because I did it ignorantly in unbelief .
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	14	And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	15	This is a faithful saying , and worthy of all acceptation , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom I am chief .
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	16	Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering , for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting .
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	17	Now unto the King eternal , immortal , invisible , the only wise God , be honour and glory for ever and ever . Amen .
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	18	This charge I commit unto thee , son Timothy , according to the prophecies which went before on thee , that thou by them mightest war a good warfare ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	19	Holding faith , and a good conscience ; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck :
KJV	1%20Timothy	1	20	Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander ; whom I have delivered unto Satan , that they may learn not to blaspheme .
KJV	1%20Timothy	2	1	Timothy
KJV	1%20Timothy	2	2	For kings , and for all that are in authority ; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty .
KJV	1%20Timothy	2	3	For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	2	4	Who will have all men to be saved , and to come unto the knowledge of the truth .
KJV	1%20Timothy	2	5	For there is one God , and one mediator between God and men , the man Christ Jesus ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	2	6	Who gave himself a ransom for all , to be testified in due time .
KJV	1%20Timothy	2	7	Whereunto I am ordained a preacher , and an apostle , ( I speak the truth in Christ , and lie not ; ) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity .
KJV	1%20Timothy	2	8	I will therefore that men pray every where , lifting up holy hands , without wrath and doubting .
KJV	1%20Timothy	2	9	In like manner also , that women adorn themselves in modest apparel , with shamefacedness and sobriety ; not with broided hair , or gold , or pearls , or costly array ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	2	10	But ( which becometh women professing godliness ) with good works .
KJV	1%20Timothy	2	11	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection .
KJV	1%20Timothy	2	12	But I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence .
KJV	1%20Timothy	2	13	For Adam was first formed , then Eve .
KJV	1%20Timothy	2	14	And Adam was not deceived , but the woman being deceived was in the transgression .
KJV	1%20Timothy	2	15	Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing , if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety .
KJV	1%20Timothy	3	1	Timothy
KJV	1%20Timothy	3	3	Not given to wine , no striker , not greedy of filthy lucre ; but patient , not a brawler , not covetous ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	3	2	A bishop then must be blameless , the husband of one wife , vigilant , sober , of good behaviour , given to hospitality , apt to teach ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	3	4	One that ruleth well his own house , having his children in subjection with all gravity ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	3	5	( For if a man know not how to rule his own house , how shall he take care of the church of God ? )
KJV	1%20Timothy	3	6	Not a novice , lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil .
KJV	1%20Timothy	3	7	Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without ; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil .
KJV	1%20Timothy	3	8	Likewise must the deacons be grave , not doubletongued , not given to much wine , not greedy of filthy lucre ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	3	9	Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience .
KJV	1%20Timothy	3	10	And let these also first be proved ; then let them use the office of a deacon , being found blameless .
KJV	1%20Timothy	3	11	Even so must their wives be grave , not slanderers , sober , faithful in all things .
KJV	1%20Timothy	3	12	Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
KJV	1%20Timothy	3	13	For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree , and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus .
KJV	1%20Timothy	3	14	These things write I unto thee , hoping to come unto thee shortly :
KJV	1%20Timothy	3	15	But if I tarry long , that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth .
KJV	1%20Timothy	3	16	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness : God was manifest in the flesh , justified in the Spirit , seen of angels , preached unto the Gentiles , believed on in the world , received up into glory .
KJV	1%20Timothy	4	1	Timothy
KJV	1%20Timothy	4	4	For every creature of God is good , and nothing to be refused , if it be received with thanksgiving :
KJV	1%20Timothy	4	2	Speaking lies in hypocrisy ; having their conscience seared with a hot iron ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	4	3	Forbidding to marry , and commanding to abstain from meats , which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth .
KJV	1%20Timothy	4	5	For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer .
KJV	1%20Timothy	4	6	If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things , thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ , nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine , whereunto thou hast attained .
KJV	1%20Timothy	4	7	But refuse profane and old wives ' fables , and exercise thyself rather unto godliness .
KJV	1%20Timothy	4	8	For bodily exercise profiteth little : but godliness is profitable unto all things , having promise of the life that now is , and of that which is to come .
KJV	1%20Timothy	4	9	This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation .
KJV	1%20Timothy	4	10	For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach , because we trust in the living God , who is the Saviour of all men , specially of those that believe .
KJV	1%20Timothy	4	11	These things command and teach .
KJV	1%20Timothy	4	12	Let no man despise thy youth ; but be thou an example of the believers , in word , in conversation , in charity , in spirit , in faith , in purity .
KJV	1%20Timothy	4	13	Till I come , give attendance to reading , to exhortation , to doctrine .
KJV	1%20Timothy	4	14	Neglect not the gift that is in thee , which was given thee by prophecy , with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery .
KJV	1%20Timothy	4	15	Meditate upon these things ; give thyself wholly to them ; that thy profiting may appear to all .
KJV	1%20Timothy	4	16	Take heed unto thyself , and unto the doctrine ; continue in them : for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself , and them that hear thee .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	1	Timothy
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	5	Now she that is a widow indeed , and desolate , trusteth in God , and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	2	The elder women as mothers ; the younger as sisters , with all purity .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	3	Honour widows that are widows indeed .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	4	But if any widow have children or nephews , let them learn first to shew piety at home , and to requite their parents : for that is good and acceptable before God .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	6	But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	7	And these things give in charge , that they may be blameless .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	8	But if any provide not for his own , and specially for those of his own house , he hath denied the faith , and is worse than an infidel .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	9	Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old , having been the wife of one man .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	10	Well reported of for good works ; if she have brought up children , if she have lodged strangers , if she have washed the saints ' feet , if she have relieved the afflicted , if she have diligently followed every good work .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	11	But the younger widows refuse : for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ , they will marry ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	12	Having damnation , because they have cast off their first faith .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	13	And withal they learn to be idle , wandering about from house to house ; and not only idle , but tattlers also and busybodies , speaking things which they ought not .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	14	I will therefore that the younger women marry , bear children , guide the house , give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	15	For some are already turned aside after Satan .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	16	If any man or woman that believeth have widows , let them relieve them , and let not the church be charged ; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	17	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour , especially they who labour in the word and doctrine .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	18	For the scripture saith , thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn . And , The labourer is worthy of his reward .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	19	Against an elder receive not an accusation , but before two or three witnesses .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	20	Them that sin rebuke before all , that others also may fear .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	21	I charge thee before God , and the Lord Jesus Christ , and the elect angels , that thou observe these things without preferring one before another , doing nothing by partiality .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	22	Lay hands suddenly on no man , neither be partaker of other men 's sins : keep thyself pure .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	23	Drink no longer water , but use a little wine for thy stomach 's sake and thine often infirmities .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	24	Some men 's sins are open beforehand , going before to judgment ; and some men they follow after .
KJV	1%20Timothy	5	25	Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand ; and they that are otherwise can not be hid .
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	1	Timothy
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	6	But godliness with contentment is great gain .
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	2	And they that have believing masters , let them not despise them , because they are brethren ; but rather do them service , because they are faithful and beloved , partakers of the benefit . These things teach and exhort .
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	3	If any man teach otherwise , and consent not to wholesome words , even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ , and to the doctrine which is according to godliness ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	4	He is proud , knowing nothing , but doting about questions and strifes of words , whereof cometh envy , strife , railings , evil surmisings ,
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	5	Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds , and destitute of the truth , supposing that gain is godliness : from such withdraw thyself .
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	7	For we brought nothing into this world , and it is certain we can carry nothing out .
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	8	And having food and raiment let us be therewith content .
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	9	But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare , and into many foolish and hurtful lusts , which drown men in destruction and perdition .
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	10	For the love of money is the root of all evil : which while some coveted after , they have erred from the faith , and pierced themselves through with many sorrows .
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	11	But thou , O man of God , flee these things ; and follow after righteousness , godliness , faith , love , patience , meekness .
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	12	Fight the good fight of faith , lay hold on eternal life , whereunto thou art also called , and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses .
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	13	I give thee charge in the sight of God , who quickeneth all things , and before Christ Jesus , who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	14	That thou keep this commandment without spot , unrebukable , until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ :
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	15	Which in his times he shall shew , who is the blessed and only Potentate , the King of kings , and Lord of lords ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	16	Who only hath immortality , dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto ; whom no man hath seen , nor can see : to whom be honour and power everlasting . Amen .
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	17	Charge them that are rich in this world , that they be not highminded , nor trust in uncertain riches , but in the living God , who giveth us richly all things to enjoy ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	18	That they do good , that they be rich in good works , ready to distribute , willing to communicate ;
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	19	Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come , that they may lay hold on eternal life .
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	20	O Timothy , keep that which is committed to thy trust , avoiding profane and vain babblings , and oppositions of science falsely so called :
KJV	1%20Timothy	6	21	Which some professing have erred concerning the faith . Grace be with thee . Amen .
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	2	To Timothy , my dearly beloved son : Grace , mercy , and peace , from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord .
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus ,
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	3	I thank God , whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience , that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day ;
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	4	Greatly desiring to see thee , being mindful of thy tears , that I may be filled with joy ;
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	5	When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee , which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois , and thy mother Eunice ; and I am persuaded that in thee also .
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	6	Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God , which is in thee by the putting on of my hands .
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	7	For God hath not given us the spirit of fear ; but of power , and of love , and of a sound mind .
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	8	Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me his prisoner : but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God ;
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	9	Who hath saved us , and called us with an holy calling , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and grace , which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began ,
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	10	But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ , who hath abolished death , and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel :
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	11	Whereunto I am appointed a preacher , and an apostle , and a teacher of the Gentiles .
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	12	For the which cause I also suffer these things : nevertheless I am not ashamed : for I know whom I have believed , and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day .
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	13	Hold fast the form of sound words , which thou hast heard of me , in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	14	That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us .
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	15	This thou knowest , that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me ; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes .
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	16	The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus ; for he oft refreshed me , and was not ashamed of my chain :
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	17	But , when he was in Rome , he sought me out very diligently , and found me .
KJV	2%20Timothy	1	18	The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day : and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus , thou knowest very well .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	2	And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses , the same commit thou to faithful men , who shall be able to teach others also .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	3	Thou therefore endure hardness , as a good soldier of Jesus Christ .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	4	No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life ; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	5	And if a man also strive for masteries , yet is he not crowned , except he strive lawfully .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	6	The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	7	Consider what I say ; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	8	Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel :
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	9	Wherein I suffer trouble , as an evil doer , even unto bonds ; but the word of God is not bound .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	10	Therefore I endure all things for the elect 's sakes , that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	11	It is a faithful saying : For if we be dead with him , we shall also live with him :
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	12	If we suffer , we shall also reign with him : if we deny him , he also will deny us :
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	13	If we believe not , yet he abideth faithful : he can not deny himself .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	14	Of these things put them in remembrance , charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit , but to the subverting of the hearers .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	15	Study to shew thyself approved unto God , a workman that needeth not to be ashamed , rightly dividing the word of truth .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	16	But shun profane and vain babblings : for they will increase unto more ungodliness .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	17	And their word will eat as doth a canker : of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus ;
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	18	Who concerning the truth have erred , saying that the resurrection is past already ; and overthrow the faith of some .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	19	Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure , having this seal , The Lord knoweth them that are his . And , let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	20	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver , but also of wood and of earth ; and some to honour , and some to dishonour .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	21	If a man therefore purge himself from these , he shall be a vessel unto honour , sanctified , and meet for the master 's use , and prepared unto every good work .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	22	Flee also youthful lusts : but follow righteousness , faith , charity , peace , with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	23	But foolish and unlearned questions avoid , knowing that they do gender strifes .
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	24	And the servant of the Lord must not strive ; but be gentle unto all men , apt to teach , patient ,
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	25	In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves ; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth ;
KJV	2%20Timothy	2	26	And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil , who are taken captive by him at his will .
KJV	2%20Timothy	3	2	For men shall be lovers of their own selves , covetous , boasters , proud , blasphemers , disobedient to parents , unthankful , unholy ,
KJV	2%20Timothy	3	3	Without natural affection , trucebreakers , false accusers , incontinent , fierce , despisers of those that are good ,
KJV	2%20Timothy	3	4	Traitors , heady , highminded , lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God ;
KJV	2%20Timothy	3	5	Having a form of godliness , but denying the power thereof : from such turn away .
KJV	2%20Timothy	3	6	For of this sort are they which creep into houses , and lead captive silly women laden with sins , led away with divers lusts ,
KJV	2%20Timothy	3	7	Ever learning , and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth .
KJV	2%20Timothy	3	8	Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses , so do these also resist the truth : men of corrupt minds , reprobate concerning the faith .
KJV	2%20Timothy	3	9	But they shall proceed no further : for their folly shall be manifest unto all men , as their 's also was .
KJV	2%20Timothy	3	10	But thou hast fully known my doctrine , manner of life , purpose , faith , longsuffering , charity , patience ,
KJV	2%20Timothy	3	11	Persecutions , afflictions , which came unto me at Antioch , at Iconium , at Lystra ; what persecutions I endured : but out of them all the Lord delivered me .
KJV	2%20Timothy	3	12	Yea , and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution .
KJV	2%20Timothy	3	13	But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse , deceiving , and being deceived .
KJV	2%20Timothy	3	14	But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of , knowing of whom thou hast learned them ;
KJV	2%20Timothy	3	15	And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures , which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus .
KJV	2%20Timothy	3	16	All scripture is given by inspiration of God , and is profitable for doctrine , for reproof , for correction , for instruction in righteousness :
KJV	2%20Timothy	3	17	That the man of God may be perfect , thoroughly furnished unto all good works .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	2	Preach the word ; be instant in season , out of season ; reprove , rebuke , exhort with all long suffering and doctrine .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	4	And they shall turn away their ears from the truth , and shall be turned unto fables .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	3	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine ; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers , having itching ears ;
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	5	But watch thou in all things , endure afflictions , do the work of an evangelist , make full proof of thy ministry .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	6	For I am now ready to be offered , and the time of my departure is at hand .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	7	I have fought a good fight , I have finished my course , I have kept the faith :
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	8	Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , shall give me at that day : and not to me only , but unto all them also that love his appearing .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	9	Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me :
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	10	For Demas hath forsaken me , having loved this present world , and is departed unto Thessalonica ; Crescens to Galatia , Titus unto Dalmatia .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	11	Only Luke is with me . Take Mark , and bring him with thee : for he is profitable to me for the ministry .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	12	And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	13	The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus , when thou comest , bring with thee , and the books , but especially the parchments .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	14	Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil : the Lord reward him according to his works :
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	15	Of whom be thou ware also ; for he hath greatly withstood our words .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	16	At my first answer no man stood with me , but all men forsook me : I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	17	Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me , and strengthened me ; that by me the preaching might be fully known , and that all the Gentiles might hear : and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	18	And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom : to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	19	Salute Prisca and Aquila , and the household of Onesiphorus .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	20	Erastus abode at Corinth : but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	21	Do thy diligence to come before winter . Eubulus greeteth thee , and Pudens , and Linus , and Claudia , and all the brethren .
KJV	2%20Timothy	4	22	The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit . Grace be with you . Amen .
KJV	Titus	1	1	Paul , a servant of God , and an apostle of Jesus Christ , according to the faith of God 's elect , and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness ;
KJV	Titus	1	2	In hope of eternal life , which God , that can not lie , promised before the world began ;
KJV	Titus	1	3	But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching , which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour ;
KJV	Titus	1	4	To Titus , mine own son after the common faith : Grace , mercy , and peace , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour .
KJV	Titus	1	5	For this cause left I thee in Crete , that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting , and ordain elders in every city , as I had appointed thee :
KJV	Titus	1	6	If any be blameless , the husband of one wife , having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly .
KJV	Titus	1	7	For a bishop must be blameless , as the steward of God ; not selfwilled , not soon angry , not given to wine , no striker , not given to filthy lucre ;
KJV	Titus	1	8	But a lover of hospitality , a lover of good men , sober , just , holy , temperate ;
KJV	Titus	1	9	Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught , that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers .
KJV	Titus	1	10	For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers , specially they of the circumcision :
KJV	Titus	1	11	Whose mouths must be stopped , who subvert whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for filthy lucre 's sake .
KJV	Titus	1	12	One of themselves , even a prophet of their own , said , the Cretians are alway liars , evil beasts , slow bellies .
KJV	Titus	1	13	This witness is true . Wherefore rebuke them sharply , that they may be sound in the faith ;
KJV	Titus	1	14	Not giving heed to Jewish fables , and commandments of men , that turn from the truth .
KJV	Titus	1	15	Unto the pure all things are pure : but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure ; but even their mind and conscience is defiled .
KJV	Titus	1	16	They profess that they know God ; but in works they deny him , being abominable , and disobedient , and unto every good work reprobate .
KJV	Titus	2	2	That the aged men be sober , grave , temperate , sound in faith , in charity , in patience .
KJV	Titus	2	3	The aged women likewise , that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness , not false accusers , not given to much wine , teachers of good things ;
KJV	Titus	2	4	That they may teach the young women to be sober , to love their husbands , to love their children ,
KJV	Titus	2	5	To be discreet , chaste , keepers at home , good , obedient to their own husbands , that the word of God be not blasphemed .
KJV	Titus	2	6	Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded .
KJV	Titus	2	7	In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works : in doctrine shewing uncorruptness , gravity , sincerity ,
KJV	Titus	2	8	Sound speech , that can not be condemned ; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed , having no evil thing to say of you .
KJV	Titus	2	9	Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters , and to please them well in all things ; not answering again ;
KJV	Titus	2	10	Not purloining , but shewing all good fidelity ; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things .
KJV	Titus	2	11	For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men ,
KJV	Titus	2	12	Teaching us that , denying ungodliness and worldly lusts , we should live soberly , righteously , and godly , in this present world ;
KJV	Titus	2	13	Looking for that blessed hope , and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ ;
KJV	Titus	2	14	Who gave himself for us , that he might redeem us from all iniquity , and purify unto himself a peculiar people , zealous of good works .
KJV	Titus	2	15	These things speak , and exhort , and rebuke with all authority . Let no man despise thee .
KJV	Titus	3	3	For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish , disobedient , deceived , serving divers lusts and pleasures , living in malice and envy , hateful , and hating one another .
KJV	Titus	3	2	To speak evil of no man , to be no brawlers , but gentle , shewing all meekness unto all men .
KJV	Titus	3	4	But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared ,
KJV	Titus	3	5	Not by works of righteousness which we have done , but according to his mercy he saved us , by the washing of regeneration , and renewing of the Holy Ghost ;
KJV	Titus	3	6	Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour ;
KJV	Titus	3	7	That being justified by his grace , we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
KJV	Titus	3	8	This is a faithful saying , and these things I will that thou affirm constantly , that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works . These things are good and profitable unto men .
KJV	Titus	3	9	But avoid foolish questions , and genealogies , and contentions , and strivings about the law ; for they are unprofitable and vain .
KJV	Titus	3	10	A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject ;
KJV	Titus	3	11	Knowing that he that is such is subverted , and sinneth , being condemned of himself .
KJV	Titus	3	12	When I shall send Artemas unto thee , or Tychicus , be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis : for I have determined there to winter .
KJV	Titus	3	13	Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently , that nothing be wanting unto them .
KJV	Titus	3	14	And let our 's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses , that they be not unfruitful .
KJV	Titus	3	15	All that are with me salute thee . Greet them that love us in the faith . Grace be with you all . Amen .
KJV	Philemon	1	1	Paul , a prisoner of Jesus Christ , and Timothy our brother , unto Philemon our dearly beloved , and fellowlabourer ,
KJV	Philemon	1	2	And to our beloved Apphia , and Archippus our fellowsoldier , and to the church in thy house :
KJV	Philemon	1	3	Grace to you , and peace , from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	Philemon	1	4	I thank my God , making mention of thee always in my prayers ,
KJV	Philemon	1	5	Hearing of thy love and faith , which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus , and toward all saints ;
KJV	Philemon	1	6	That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus .
KJV	Philemon	1	7	For we have great joy and consolation in thy love , because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee , brother .
KJV	Philemon	1	8	Wherefore , though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient ,
KJV	Philemon	1	9	Yet for love 's sake I rather beseech thee , being such an one as Paul the aged , and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ .
KJV	Philemon	1	10	I beseech thee for my son Onesimus , whom I have begotten in my bonds :
KJV	Philemon	1	11	Which in time past was to thee unprofitable , but now profitable to thee and to me :
KJV	Philemon	1	12	Whom I have sent again : thou therefore receive him , that is , mine own bowels :
KJV	Philemon	1	13	Whom I would have retained with me , that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel :
KJV	Philemon	1	14	But without thy mind would I do nothing ; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity , but willingly .
KJV	Philemon	1	15	For perhaps he therefore departed for a season , that thou shouldest receive him for ever ;
KJV	Philemon	1	16	Not now as a servant , but above a servant , a brother beloved , specially to me , but how much more unto thee , both in the flesh , and in the Lord ?
KJV	Philemon	1	17	If thou count me therefore a partner , receive him as myself .
KJV	Philemon	1	18	If he hath wronged thee , or oweth thee ought , put that on mine account ;
KJV	Philemon	1	19	I Paul have written it with mine own hand , I will repay it : albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides .
KJV	Philemon	1	20	Yea , brother , let me have joy of thee in the Lord : refresh my bowels in the Lord .
KJV	Philemon	1	21	Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee , knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say .
KJV	Philemon	1	22	But withal prepare me also a lodging : for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you .
KJV	Philemon	1	23	There salute thee Epaphras , my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus ;
KJV	Philemon	1	24	Marcus , Aristarchus , Demas , Lucas , my fellowlabourers .
KJV	Philemon	1	25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit . Amen .
KJV	Hebrews	1	1	God , who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets ,
KJV	Hebrews	1	2	Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son , whom he hath appointed heir of all things , by whom also he made the worlds ;
KJV	Hebrews	1	3	Who being the brightness of his glory , and the express image of his person , and upholding all things by the word of his power , when he had by himself purged our sins , sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high :
KJV	Hebrews	1	4	Being made so much better than the angels , as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they .
KJV	Hebrews	1	5	For unto which of the angels said he at any time , Thou art my Son , this day have I begotten thee ? And again , I will be to him a Father , and he shall be to me a Son ?
KJV	Hebrews	1	6	And again , when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world , he saith , And let all the angels of God worship him .
KJV	Hebrews	1	7	And of the angels he saith , Who maketh his angels spirits , and his ministers a flame of fire .
KJV	Hebrews	1	8	But unto the Son he saith , Thy throne , O God , is for ever and ever : a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom .
KJV	Hebrews	1	9	Thou hast loved righteousness , and hated iniquity ; therefore God , even thy God , hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows .
KJV	Hebrews	1	10	And , Thou , Lord , in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth ; and the heavens are the works of thine hands :
KJV	Hebrews	1	11	They shall perish ; but thou remainest ; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment ;
KJV	Hebrews	1	12	And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up , and they shall be changed : but thou art the same , and thy years shall not fail .
KJV	Hebrews	1	13	But to which of the angels said he at any time , Sit on my right hand , until I make thine enemies thy footstool ?
KJV	Hebrews	1	14	Are they not all ministering spirits , sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation ?
KJV	Hebrews	2	2	For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast , and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward ;
KJV	Hebrews	2	3	How shall we escape , if we neglect so great salvation ; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord , and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him ;
KJV	Hebrews	2	4	God also bearing them witness , both with signs and wonders , and with divers miracles , and gifts of the Holy Ghost , according to his own will ?
KJV	Hebrews	2	5	For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come , whereof we speak .
KJV	Hebrews	2	6	But one in a certain place testified , saying , What is man , that thou art mindful of him ? or the son of man that thou visitest him ?
KJV	Hebrews	2	7	Thou madest him a little lower than the angels ; thou crownedst him with glory and honour , and didst set him over the works of thy hands :
KJV	Hebrews	2	8	Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet . For in that he put all in subjection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . But now we see not yet all things put under him .
KJV	Hebrews	2	9	But we see Jesus , who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death , crowned with glory and honour ; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man .
KJV	Hebrews	2	10	For it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons unto glory , to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
KJV	Hebrews	2	11	For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one : for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
KJV	Hebrews	2	12	Saying , I will declare thy name unto my brethren , in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee .
KJV	Hebrews	2	13	And again , I will put my trust in him . And again , Behold I and the children which God hath given me .
KJV	Hebrews	2	14	Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood , he also himself likewise took part of the same ; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death , that is , the devil ;
KJV	Hebrews	2	15	And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage .
KJV	Hebrews	2	16	For verily he took not on him the nature of angels ; but he took on him the seed of Abraham .
KJV	Hebrews	2	17	Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren , that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God , to make reconciliation for the sins of the people .
KJV	Hebrews	2	18	For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted , he is able to succour them that are tempted .
KJV	Hebrews	3	3	For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses , inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house .
KJV	Hebrews	3	2	Who was faithful to him that appointed him , as also Moses was faithful in all his house .
KJV	Hebrews	3	4	For every house is builded by some man ; but he that built all things is God .
KJV	Hebrews	3	5	And Moses verily was faithful in all his house , as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after ;
KJV	Hebrews	3	6	But Christ as a son over his own house ; whose house are we , if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end .
KJV	Hebrews	3	7	Wherefore ( as the Holy Ghost saith , To day if ye will hear his voice ,
KJV	Hebrews	3	8	Harden not your hearts , as in the provocation , in the day of temptation in the wilderness :
KJV	Hebrews	3	9	When your fathers tempted me , proved me , and saw my works forty years .
KJV	Hebrews	3	10	Wherefore I was grieved with that generation , and said , They do alway err in their heart ; and they have not known my ways .
KJV	Hebrews	3	11	So I sware in my wrath , They shall not enter into my rest . )
KJV	Hebrews	3	12	Take heed , brethren , lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief , in departing from the living God .
KJV	Hebrews	3	13	But exhort one another daily , while it is called To day ; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin .
KJV	Hebrews	3	14	For we are made partakers of Christ , if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end ;
KJV	Hebrews	3	15	While it is said , To day if ye will hear his voice , harden not your hearts , as in the provocation .
KJV	Hebrews	3	16	For some , when they had heard , did provoke : howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses .
KJV	Hebrews	3	17	But with whom was he grieved forty years ? was it not with them that had sinned , whose carcases fell in the wilderness ?
KJV	Hebrews	3	18	And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest , but to them that believed not ?
KJV	Hebrews	3	19	So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief .
KJV	Hebrews	4	4	For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise , And God did rest the seventh day from all his works .
KJV	Hebrews	4	2	For unto us was the gospel preached , as well as unto them : but the word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
KJV	Hebrews	4	3	For we which have believed do enter into rest , as he said , As I have sworn in my wrath , if they shall enter into my rest : although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
KJV	Hebrews	4	5	And in this place again , If they shall enter into my rest .
KJV	Hebrews	4	6	Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein , and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief :
KJV	Hebrews	4	7	Again , he limiteth a certain day , saying in David , To day , after so long a time ; as it is said , To day if ye will hear his voice , harden not your hearts .
KJV	Hebrews	4	8	For if Jesus had given them rest , then would he not afterward have spoken of another day .
KJV	Hebrews	4	9	There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God .
KJV	Hebrews	4	10	For he that is entered into his rest , he also hath ceased from his own works , as God did from his .
KJV	Hebrews	4	11	Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest , lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief .
KJV	Hebrews	4	12	For the word of God is quick , and powerful , and sharper than any twoedged sword , piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit , and of the joints and marrow , and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart .
KJV	Hebrews	4	13	Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight : but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
KJV	Hebrews	4	14	Seeing then that we have a great high priest , that is passed into the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold fast our profession .
KJV	Hebrews	4	15	For we have not an high priest which can not be touched with the feeling of our infirmities ; but was in all points tempted like as we are , yet without sin .
KJV	Hebrews	4	16	Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace , that we may obtain mercy , and find grace to help in time of need .
KJV	Hebrews	5	5	So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest ; but he that said unto him , Thou art my Son , to day have I begotten thee .
KJV	Hebrews	5	2	Who can have compassion on the ignorant , and on them that are out of the way ; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity .
KJV	Hebrews	5	3	And by reason hereof he ought , as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sins .
KJV	Hebrews	5	4	And no man taketh this honour unto himself , but he that is called of God , as was Aaron .
KJV	Hebrews	5	6	As he saith also in another place , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec .
KJV	Hebrews	5	7	Who in the days of his flesh , when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death , and was heard in that he feared ;
KJV	Hebrews	5	8	Though he were a Son , yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered ;
KJV	Hebrews	5	9	And being made perfect , he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him ;
KJV	Hebrews	5	10	Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec .
KJV	Hebrews	5	11	Of whom we have many things to say , and hard to be uttered , seeing ye are dull of hearing .
KJV	Hebrews	5	12	For when for the time ye ought to be teachers , ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God ; and are become such as have need of milk , and not of strong meat .
KJV	Hebrews	5	13	For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness : for he is a babe .
KJV	Hebrews	5	14	But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age , even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil .
KJV	Hebrews	6	6	If they shall fall away , to renew them again unto repentance ; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh , and put him to an open shame .
KJV	Hebrews	6	2	Of the doctrine of baptisms , and of laying on of hands , and of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
KJV	Hebrews	6	3	And this will we do , if God permit .
KJV	Hebrews	6	4	For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened , and have tasted of the heavenly gift , and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost ,
KJV	Hebrews	6	5	And have tasted the good word of God , and the powers of the world to come ,
KJV	Hebrews	6	7	For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it , and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed , receiveth blessing from God :
KJV	Hebrews	6	8	But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected , and is nigh unto cursing ; whose end is to be burned .
KJV	Hebrews	6	9	But , beloved , we are persuaded better things of you , and things that accompany salvation , though we thus speak .
KJV	Hebrews	6	10	For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love , which ye have shewed toward his name , in that ye have ministered to the saints , and do minister .
KJV	Hebrews	6	11	And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end :
KJV	Hebrews	6	12	That ye be not slothful , but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises .
KJV	Hebrews	6	13	For when God made promise to Abraham , because he could swear by no greater , he sware by himself ,
KJV	Hebrews	6	14	Saying , Surely blessing I will bless thee , and multiplying I will multiply thee .
KJV	Hebrews	6	15	And so , after he had patiently endured , he obtained the promise .
KJV	Hebrews	6	16	For men verily swear by the greater : and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife .
KJV	Hebrews	6	17	Wherein God , willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel , confirmed it by an oath :
KJV	Hebrews	6	18	That by two immutable things , in which it was impossible for God to lie , we might have a strong consolation , who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us :
KJV	Hebrews	6	19	Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul , both sure and stedfast , and which entereth into that within the veil ;
KJV	Hebrews	6	20	Whither the forerunner is for us entered , even Jesus , made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec .
KJV	Hebrews	7	7	And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better .
KJV	Hebrews	7	2	To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all ; first being by interpretation King of righteousness , and after that also King of Salem , which is , King of peace ;
KJV	Hebrews	7	3	Without father , without mother , without descent , having neither beginning of days , nor end of life ; but made like unto the Son of God ; abideth a priest continually .
KJV	Hebrews	7	4	Now consider how great this man was , unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils .
KJV	Hebrews	7	5	And verily they that are of the sons of Levi , who receive the office of the priesthood , have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brethren , though they come out of the loins of Abraham :
KJV	Hebrews	7	6	But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham , and blessed him that had the promises .
KJV	Hebrews	7	8	And here men that die receive tithes ; but there he receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth .
KJV	Hebrews	7	9	And as I may so say , Levi also , who receiveth tithes , payed tithes in Abraham .
KJV	Hebrews	7	10	For he was yet in the loins of his father , when Melchisedec met him .
KJV	Hebrews	7	11	If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood , ( for under it the people received the law , ) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec , and not be called after the order of Aaron ?
KJV	Hebrews	7	12	For the priesthood being changed , there is made of necessity a change also of the law .
KJV	Hebrews	7	13	For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe , of which no man gave attendance at the altar .
KJV	Hebrews	7	14	For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda ; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood .
KJV	Hebrews	7	15	And it is yet far more evident : for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest ,
KJV	Hebrews	7	16	Who is made , not after the law of a carnal commandment , but after the power of an endless life .
KJV	Hebrews	7	17	For he testifieth , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec .
KJV	Hebrews	7	18	For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof .
KJV	Hebrews	7	19	For the law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did ; by the which we draw nigh unto God .
KJV	Hebrews	7	20	And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest :
KJV	Hebrews	7	21	( For those priests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said unto him , The Lord sware and will not repent , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec : )
KJV	Hebrews	7	22	By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament .
KJV	Hebrews	7	23	And they truly were many priests , because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death :
KJV	Hebrews	7	24	But this man , because he continueth ever , hath an unchangeable priesthood .
KJV	Hebrews	7	25	Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them .
KJV	Hebrews	7	26	For such an high priest became us , who is holy , harmless , undefiled , separate from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ;
KJV	Hebrews	7	27	Who needeth not daily , as those high priests , to offer up sacrifice , first for his own sins , and then for the people 's : for this he did once , when he offered up himself .
KJV	Hebrews	7	28	For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity ; but the word of the oath , which was since the law , maketh the Son , who is consecrated for evermore .
KJV	Hebrews	8	8	For finding fault with them , he saith , Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah :
KJV	Hebrews	8	2	A minister of the sanctuary , and of the true tabernacle , which the Lord pitched , and not man .
KJV	Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices : wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer .
KJV	Hebrews	8	4	For if he were on earth , he should not be a priest , seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law :
KJV	Hebrews	8	5	Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things , as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle : for , See , saith he , that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount .
KJV	Hebrews	8	6	But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry , by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises .
KJV	Hebrews	8	7	For if that first covenant had been faultless , then should no place have been sought for the second .
KJV	Hebrews	8	9	Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt ; because they continued not in my covenant , and I regarded them not , saith the Lord .
KJV	Hebrews	8	10	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , saith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hearts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people :
KJV	Hebrews	8	11	And they shall not teach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
KJV	Hebrews	8	12	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness , and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more .
KJV	Hebrews	8	13	In that he saith , A new covenant , he hath made the first old . Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away .
KJV	Hebrews	9	9	Which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices , that could not make him that did the service perfect , as pertaining to the conscience ;
KJV	Hebrews	9	2	For there was a tabernacle made ; the first , wherein was the candlestick , and the table , and the shewbread ; which is called the sanctuary .
KJV	Hebrews	9	3	And after the second veil , the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all ;
KJV	Hebrews	9	4	Which had the golden censer , and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold , wherein was the golden pot that had manna , and Aaron 's rod that budded , and the tables of the covenant ;
KJV	Hebrews	9	5	And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat ; of which we can not now speak particularly .
KJV	Hebrews	9	6	Now when these things were thus ordained , the priests went always into the first tabernacle , accomplishing the service of God .
KJV	Hebrews	9	7	But into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people :
KJV	Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Ghost this signifying , that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest , while as the first tabernacle was yet standing :
KJV	Hebrews	9	10	Which stood only in meats and drinks , and divers washings , and carnal ordinances , imposed on them until the time of reformation .
KJV	Hebrews	9	11	But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this building ;
KJV	Hebrews	9	12	Neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us .
KJV	Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean , sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh :
KJV	Hebrews	9	14	How much more shall the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God , purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ?
KJV	Hebrews	9	15	And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance .
KJV	Hebrews	9	16	For where a testament is , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator .
KJV	Hebrews	9	17	For a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth .
KJV	Hebrews	9	18	Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood .
KJV	Hebrews	9	19	For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people ,
KJV	Hebrews	9	20	Saying , This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you .
KJV	Hebrews	9	21	Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle , and all the vessels of the ministry .
KJV	Hebrews	9	22	And almost all things are by the law purged with blood ; and without shedding of blood is no remission .
KJV	Hebrews	9	23	It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
KJV	Hebrews	9	24	For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us :
KJV	Hebrews	9	25	Nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others ;
KJV	Hebrews	9	26	For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
KJV	Hebrews	9	27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die , but after this the judgment :
KJV	Hebrews	9	28	So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many ; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation .
KJV	Hebrews	10	10	By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
KJV	Hebrews	10	2	For then would they not have ceased to be offered ? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins .
KJV	Hebrews	10	3	But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year .
KJV	Hebrews	10	4	For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins .
KJV	Hebrews	10	5	Wherefore when he cometh into the world , he saith , Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not , but a body hast thou prepared me :
KJV	Hebrews	10	6	In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure .
KJV	Hebrews	10	7	Then said I , Lo , I come ( in the volume of the book it is written of me , ) to do thy will , O God .
KJV	Hebrews	10	8	Above when he said , Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not , neither hadst pleasure therein ; which are offered by the law ;
KJV	Hebrews	10	9	Then said he , Lo , I come to do thy will , O God . He taketh away the first , that he may establish the second .
KJV	Hebrews	10	11	And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins :
KJV	Hebrews	10	12	But this man , after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of God ;
KJV	Hebrews	10	13	From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool .
KJV	Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified .
KJV	Hebrews	10	15	Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us : for after that he had said before ,
KJV	Hebrews	10	16	This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , saith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hearts , and in their minds will I write them ;
KJV	Hebrews	10	17	And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more .
KJV	Hebrews	10	18	Now where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sin .
KJV	Hebrews	10	19	Having therefore , brethren , boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus ,
KJV	Hebrews	10	20	By a new and living way , which he hath consecrated for us , through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ;
KJV	Hebrews	10	21	And having an high priest over the house of God ;
KJV	Hebrews	10	22	Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and our bodies washed with pure water .
KJV	Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering ; ( for he is faithful that promised ; )
KJV	Hebrews	10	24	And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works :
KJV	Hebrews	10	25	Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as the manner of some is ; but exhorting one another : and so much the more , as ye see the day approaching .
KJV	Hebrews	10	26	For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins ,
KJV	Hebrews	10	27	But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation , which shall devour the adversaries .
KJV	Hebrews	10	28	He that despised Moses ' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses :
KJV	Hebrews	10	29	Of how much sorer punishment , suppose ye , shall he be thought worthy , who hath trodden under foot the Son of God , and hath counted the blood of the covenant , wherewith he was sanctified , an unholy thing , and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace ?
KJV	Hebrews	10	30	For we know him that hath said , Vengeance belongeth unto me , I will recompense , saith the Lord . And again , The Lord shall judge his people .
KJV	Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
KJV	Hebrews	10	32	But call to remembrance the former days , in which , after ye were illuminated , ye endured a great fight of afflictions ;
KJV	Hebrews	10	33	Partly , whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions ; and partly , whilst ye became companions of them that were so used .
KJV	Hebrews	10	34	For ye had compassion of me in my bonds , and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance .
KJV	Hebrews	10	35	Cast not away therefore your confidence , which hath great recompence of reward .
KJV	Hebrews	10	36	For ye have need of patience , that , after ye have done the will of God , ye might receive the promise .
KJV	Hebrews	10	37	For yet a little while , and he that shall come will come , and will not tarry .
KJV	Hebrews	10	38	Now the just shall live by faith : but if any man draw back , my soul shall have no pleasure in him .
KJV	Hebrews	10	39	But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition ; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul .
KJV	Hebrews	11	11	Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed , and was delivered of a child when she was past age , because she judged him faithful who had promised .
KJV	Hebrews	11	2	For by it the elders obtained a good report .
KJV	Hebrews	11	3	Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear .
KJV	Hebrews	11	4	By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain , by which he obtained witness that he was righteous , God testifying of his gifts : and by it he being dead yet speaketh .
KJV	Hebrews	11	5	By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death ; and was not found , because God had translated him : for before his translation he had this testimony , that he pleased God .
KJV	Hebrews	11	6	But without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to God must believe that he is , and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him .
KJV	Hebrews	11	7	By faith Noah , being warned of God of things not seen as yet , moved with fear , prepared an ark to the saving of his house ; by the which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith .
KJV	Hebrews	11	8	By faith Abraham , when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance , obeyed ; and he went out , not knowing whither he went .
KJV	Hebrews	11	9	By faith he sojourned in the land of promise , as in a strange country , dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise :
KJV	Hebrews	11	10	For he looked for a city which hath foundations , whose builder and maker is God .
KJV	Hebrews	11	12	Therefore sprang there even of one , and him as good as dead , so many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable .
KJV	Hebrews	11	13	These all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them afar off , and were persuaded of them , and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
KJV	Hebrews	11	14	For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country .
KJV	Hebrews	11	15	And truly , if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
KJV	Hebrews	11	16	But now they desire a better country , that is , an heavenly : wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God : for he hath prepared for them a city .
KJV	Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham , when he was tried , offered up Isaac : and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son ,
KJV	Hebrews	11	18	Of whom it was said , That in Isaac shall thy seed be called :
KJV	Hebrews	11	19	Accounting that God was able to raise him up , even from the dead ; from whence also he received him in a figure .
KJV	Hebrews	11	20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come .
KJV	Hebrews	11	21	By faith Jacob , when he was a dying , blessed both the sons of Joseph ; and worshipped , leaning upon the top of his staff .
KJV	Hebrews	11	22	By faith Joseph , when he died , made mention of the departing of the children of Israel ; and gave commandment concerning his bones .
KJV	Hebrews	11	23	By faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
KJV	Hebrews	11	24	By faith Moses , when he was come to years , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh 's daughter ;
KJV	Hebrews	11	25	Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season ;
KJV	Hebrews	11	26	Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt : for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward .
KJV	Hebrews	11	27	By faith he forsook Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king : for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible .
KJV	Hebrews	11	28	Through faith he kept the passover , and the sprinkling of blood , lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them .
KJV	Hebrews	11	29	By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land : which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned .
KJV	Hebrews	11	30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down , after they were compassed about seven days .
KJV	Hebrews	11	31	By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not , when she had received the spies with peace .
KJV	Hebrews	11	32	And what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon , and of Barak , and of Samson , and of Jephthae ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the prophets :
KJV	Hebrews	11	33	Who through faith subdued kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions .
KJV	Hebrews	11	34	Quenched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , out of weakness were made strong , waxed valiant in fight , turned to flight the armies of the aliens .
KJV	Hebrews	11	35	Women received their dead raised to life again : and others were tortured , not accepting deliverance ; that they might obtain a better resurrection :
KJV	Hebrews	11	36	And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings , yea , moreover of bonds and imprisonment :
KJV	Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned , they were sawn asunder , were tempted , were slain with the sword : they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins ; being destitute , afflicted , tormented ;
KJV	Hebrews	11	38	( Of whom the world was not worthy : ) they wandered in deserts , and in mountains , and in dens and caves of the earth .
KJV	Hebrews	11	39	And these all , having obtained a good report through faith , received not the promise :
KJV	Hebrews	11	40	God having provided some better thing for us , that they without us should not be made perfect .
KJV	Hebrews	12	12	Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down , and the feeble knees ;
KJV	Hebrews	12	2	Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith ; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising the shame , and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God .
KJV	Hebrews	12	3	For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds .
KJV	Hebrews	12	4	Ye have not yet resisted unto blood , striving against sin .
KJV	Hebrews	12	5	And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children , My son , despise not thou the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when thou art rebuked of him :
KJV	Hebrews	12	6	For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth , and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth .
KJV	Hebrews	12	7	If ye endure chastening , God dealeth with you as with sons ; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not ?
KJV	Hebrews	12	8	But if ye be without chastisement , whereof all are partakers , then are ye bastards , and not sons .
KJV	Hebrews	12	9	Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us , and we gave them reverence : shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits , and live ?
KJV	Hebrews	12	10	For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure ; but he for our profit , that we might be partakers of his holiness .
KJV	Hebrews	12	11	Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous , but grievous : nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby .
KJV	Hebrews	12	13	And make straight paths for your feet , lest that which is lame be turned out of the way ; but let it rather be healed .
KJV	Hebrews	12	14	Follow peace with all men , and holiness , without which no man shall see the Lord :
KJV	Hebrews	12	15	Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you , and thereby many be defiled ;
KJV	Hebrews	12	16	Lest there be any fornicator , or profane person , as Esau , who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright .
KJV	Hebrews	12	17	For ye know how that afterward , when he would have inherited the blessing , he was rejected : for he found no place of repentance , though he sought it carefully with tears .
KJV	Hebrews	12	18	For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched , and that burned with fire , nor unto blackness , and darkness , and tempest ,
KJV	Hebrews	12	19	And the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words ; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more :
KJV	Hebrews	12	20	( For they could not endure that which was commanded , And if so much as a beast touch the mountain , it shall be stoned , or thrust through with a dart :
KJV	Hebrews	12	21	And so terrible was the sight , that Moses said , I exceedingly fear and quake : )
KJV	Hebrews	12	22	But ye are come unto mount Sion , and unto the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to an innumerable company of angels ,
KJV	Hebrews	12	23	To the general assembly and church of the firstborn , which are written in heaven , and to God the Judge of all , and to the spirits of just men made perfect ,
KJV	Hebrews	12	24	And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling , that speaketh better things than that of Abel .
KJV	Hebrews	12	25	See that ye refuse not him that speaketh . For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth , much more shall not we escape , if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven :
KJV	Hebrews	12	26	Whose voice then shook the earth : but now he hath promised , saying , Yet once more I shake not the earth only , but also heaven .
KJV	Hebrews	12	27	And this word , Yet once more , signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that are made , that those things which can not be shaken may remain .
KJV	Hebrews	12	28	Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which can not be moved , let us have grace , whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear :
KJV	Hebrews	12	29	For our God is a consuming fire .
KJV	Hebrews	13	13	Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp , bearing his reproach .
KJV	Hebrews	13	2	Be not forgetful to entertain strangers : for thereby some have entertained angels unawares .
KJV	Hebrews	13	3	Remember them that are in bonds , as bound with them ; and them which suffer adversity , as being yourselves also in the body .
KJV	Hebrews	13	4	Marriage is honourable in all , and the bed undefiled : but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge .
KJV	Hebrews	13	5	Let your conversation be without covetousness ; and be content with such things as ye have : for he hath said , I will never leave thee , nor forsake thee .
KJV	Hebrews	13	6	So that we may boldly say , The Lord is my helper , and I will not fear what man shall do unto me .
KJV	Hebrews	13	7	Remember them which have the rule over you , who have spoken unto you the word of God : whose faith follow , considering the end of their conversation .
KJV	Hebrews	13	8	Jesus Christ the same yesterday , and to day , and for ever .
KJV	Hebrews	13	9	Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines . For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace ; not with meats , which have not profited them that have been occupied therein .
KJV	Hebrews	13	10	We have an altar , whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle .
KJV	Hebrews	13	11	For the bodies of those beasts , whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin , are burned without the camp .
KJV	Hebrews	13	12	Wherefore Jesus also , that he might sanctify the people with his own blood , suffered without the gate .
KJV	Hebrews	13	14	For here have we no continuing city , but we seek one to come .
KJV	Hebrews	13	15	By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually , that is , the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name .
KJV	Hebrews	13	16	But to do good and to communicate forget not : for with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
KJV	Hebrews	13	17	Obey them that have the rule over you , and submit yourselves : for they watch for your souls , as they that must give account , that they may do it with joy , and not with grief : for that is unprofitable for you .
KJV	Hebrews	13	18	Pray for us : for we trust we have a good conscience , in all things willing to live honestly .
KJV	Hebrews	13	19	But I beseech you the rather to do this , that I may be restored to you the sooner .
KJV	Hebrews	13	20	Now the God of peace , that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus , that great shepherd of the sheep , through the blood of the everlasting covenant ,
KJV	Hebrews	13	21	Make you perfect in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ ; to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
KJV	Hebrews	13	22	And I beseech you , brethren , suffer the word of exhortation : for I have written a letter unto you in few words .
KJV	Hebrews	13	23	Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty ; with whom , if he come shortly , I will see you .
KJV	Hebrews	13	24	Salute all them that have the rule over you , and all the saints . They of Italy salute you .
KJV	Hebrews	13	25	Grace be with you all . Amen .
KJV	James	1	1	James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad , greeting .
KJV	James	1	2	My brethren , count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations ;
KJV	James	1	3	Knowing this , that the trying of your faith worketh patience .
KJV	James	1	4	But let patience have her perfect work , that ye may be perfect and entire , wanting nothing .
KJV	James	1	5	If any of you lack wisdom , let him ask of God , that giveth to all men liberally , and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him .
KJV	James	1	6	But let him ask in faith , nothing wavering . For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed .
KJV	James	1	7	For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord .
KJV	James	1	8	A double minded man is unstable in all his ways .
KJV	James	1	9	Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted :
KJV	James	1	10	But the rich , in that he is made low : because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away .
KJV	James	1	11	For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat , but it withereth the grass , and the flower thereof falleth , and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth : so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways .
KJV	James	1	12	Blessed is the man that endureth temptation : for when he is tried , he shall receive the crown of life , which the Lord hath promised to them that love him .
KJV	James	1	13	Let no man say when he is tempted , I am tempted of God : for God can not be tempted with evil , neither tempteth he any man :
KJV	James	1	14	But every man is tempted , when he is drawn away of his own lust , and enticed .
KJV	James	1	15	Then when lust hath conceived , it bringeth forth sin : and sin , when it is finished , bringeth forth death .
KJV	James	1	16	Do not err , my beloved brethren .
KJV	James	1	17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning .
KJV	James	1	18	Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth , that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures .
KJV	James	1	19	Wherefore , my beloved brethren , let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , slow to wrath :
KJV	James	1	20	For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God .
KJV	James	1	21	Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness , and receive with meekness the engrafted word , which is able to save your souls .
KJV	James	1	22	But be ye doers of the word , and not hearers only , deceiving your own selves .
KJV	James	1	23	For if any be a hearer of the word , and not a doer , he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass :
KJV	James	1	24	For he beholdeth himself , and goeth his way , and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was .
KJV	James	1	25	But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty , and continueth therein , he being not a forgetful hearer , but a doer of the work , this man shall be blessed in his deed .
KJV	James	1	26	If any man among you seem to be religious , and bridleth not his tongue , but deceiveth his own heart , this man 's religion is vain .
KJV	James	1	27	Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this , To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction , and to keep himself unspotted from the world .
KJV	James	2	2	For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring , in goodly apparel , and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment ;
KJV	James	2	3	And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing , and say unto him , Sit thou here in a good place ; and say to the poor , Stand thou there , or sit here under my footstool :
KJV	James	2	4	Are ye not then partial in yourselves , and are become judges of evil thoughts ?
KJV	James	2	5	Hearken , my beloved brethren , Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him ?
KJV	James	2	6	But ye have despised the poor . Do not rich men oppress you , and draw you before the judgment seats ?
KJV	James	2	7	Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called ?
KJV	James	2	8	If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself , ye do well :
KJV	James	2	9	But if ye have respect to persons , ye commit sin , and are convinced of the law as transgressors .
KJV	James	2	10	For whosoever shall keep the whole law , and yet offend in one point , he is guilty of all .
KJV	James	2	11	For he that said , Do not commit adultery , said also , Do not kill . Now if thou commit no adultery , yet if thou kill , thou art become a transgressor of the law .
KJV	James	2	12	So speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty .
KJV	James	2	13	For he shall have judgment without mercy , that hath shewed no mercy ; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment .
KJV	James	2	14	What doth it profit , my brethren , though a man say he hath faith , and have not works ? can faith save him ?
KJV	James	2	15	If a brother or sister be naked , and destitute of daily food ,
KJV	James	2	16	And one of you say unto them , Depart in peace , be ye warmed and filled ; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body ; what doth it profit ?
KJV	James	2	17	Even so faith , if it hath not works , is dead , being alone .
KJV	James	2	18	Yea , a man may say , Thou hast faith , and I have works : shew me thy faith without thy works , and I will shew thee my faith by my works .
KJV	James	2	19	Thou believest that there is one God ; thou doest well : the devils also believe , and tremble .
KJV	James	2	20	But wilt thou know , O vain man , that faith without works is dead ?
KJV	James	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works , when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar ?
KJV	James	2	22	Seest thou how faith wrought with his works , and by works was faith made perfect ?
KJV	James	2	23	And the scripture was fulfilled which saith , Abraham believed God , and it was imputed unto him for righteousness : and he was called the Friend of God .
KJV	James	2	24	Ye see then how that by works a man is justified , and not by faith only .
KJV	James	2	25	Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works , when she had received the messengers , and had sent them out another way ?
KJV	James	2	26	For as the body without the spirit is dead , so faith without works is dead also .
KJV	James	3	3	Behold , we put bits in the horses ' mouths , that they may obey us ; and we turn about their whole body .
KJV	James	3	2	For in many things we offend all . If any man offend not in word , the same is a perfect man , and able also to bridle the whole body .
KJV	James	3	4	Behold also the ships , which though they be so great , and are driven of fierce winds , yet are they turned about with a very small helm , whithersoever the governor listeth .
KJV	James	3	5	Even so the tongue is a little member , and boasteth great things . Behold , how great a matter a little fire kindleth !
KJV	James	3	6	And the tongue is a fire , a world of iniquity : so is the tongue among our members , that it defileth the whole body , and setteth on fire the course of nature ; and it is set on fire of hell .
KJV	James	3	7	For every kind of beasts , and of birds , and of serpents , and of things in the sea , is tamed , and hath been tamed of mankind :
KJV	James	3	8	But the tongue can no man tame ; it is an unruly evil , full of deadly poison .
KJV	James	3	9	Therewith bless we God , even the Father ; and therewith curse we men , which are made after the similitude of God .
KJV	James	3	10	Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing . My brethren , these things ought not so to be .
KJV	James	3	11	Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter ?
KJV	James	3	12	Can the fig tree , my brethren , bear olive berries ? either a vine , figs ? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh .
KJV	James	3	13	Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you ? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom .
KJV	James	3	14	But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts , glory not , and lie not against the truth .
KJV	James	3	15	This wisdom descendeth not from above , but is earthly , sensual , devilish .
KJV	James	3	16	For where envying and strife is , there is confusion and every evil work .
KJV	James	3	17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , and easy to be intreated , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality , and without hypocrisy .
KJV	James	3	18	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace .
KJV	James	4	4	Ye adulterers and adulteresses , know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God ? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God .
KJV	James	4	2	Ye lust , and have not : ye kill , and desire to have , and can not obtain : ye fight and war , yet ye have not , because ye ask not .
KJV	James	4	3	Ye ask , and receive not , because ye ask amiss , that ye may consume it upon your lusts .
KJV	James	4	5	Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain , The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy ?
KJV	James	4	6	But he giveth more grace . Wherefore he saith , God resisteth the proud , but giveth grace unto the humble .
KJV	James	4	7	Submit yourselves therefore to God . Resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
KJV	James	4	8	Draw nigh to God , and he will draw nigh to you . Cleanse your hands , ye sinners ; and purify your hearts , ye double minded .
KJV	James	4	9	Be afflicted , and mourn , and weep : let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to heaviness .
KJV	James	4	10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord , and he shall lift you up .
KJV	James	4	11	Speak not evil one of another , brethren . He that speaketh evil of his brother , and judgeth his brother , speaketh evil of the law , and judgeth the law : but if thou judge the law , thou art not a doer of the law , but a judge .
KJV	James	4	12	There is one lawgiver , who is able to save and to destroy : who art thou that judgest another ?
KJV	James	4	13	Go to now , ye that say , To day or to morrow we will go into such a city , and continue there a year , and buy and sell , and get gain :
KJV	James	4	14	Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow . For what is your life ? It is even a vapour , that appeareth for a little time , and then vanisheth away .
KJV	James	4	15	For that ye ought to say , If the Lord will , we shall live , and do this , or that .
KJV	James	4	16	But now ye rejoice in your boastings : all such rejoicing is evil .
KJV	James	4	17	Therefore to him that knoweth to do good , and doeth it not , to him it is sin .
KJV	James	5	5	Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth , and been wanton ; ye have nourished your hearts , as in a day of slaughter .
KJV	James	5	2	Your riches are corrupted , and your garments are motheaten .
KJV	James	5	3	Your gold and silver is cankered ; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you , and shall eat your flesh as it were fire . Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days .
KJV	James	5	4	Behold , the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields , which is of you kept back by fraud , crieth : and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth .
KJV	James	5	6	Ye have condemned and killed the just ; and he doth not resist you .
KJV	James	5	7	Be patient therefore , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord . Behold , the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
KJV	James	5	8	Be ye also patient ; stablish your hearts : for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh .
KJV	James	5	9	Grudge not one against another , brethren , lest ye be condemned : behold , the judge standeth before the door .
KJV	James	5	10	Take , my brethren , the prophets , who have spoken in the name of the Lord , for an example of suffering affliction , and of patience .
KJV	James	5	11	Behold , we count them happy which endure . Ye have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the end of the Lord ; that the Lord is very pitiful , and of tender mercy .
KJV	James	5	12	But above all things , my brethren , swear not , neither by heaven , neither by the earth , neither by any other oath : but let your yea be yea ; and your nay , nay ; lest ye fall into condemnation .
KJV	James	5	13	Is any among you afflicted ? let him pray . Is any merry ? let him sing psalms .
KJV	James	5	14	Is any sick among you ? let him call for the elders of the church ; and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord :
KJV	James	5	15	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick , and the Lord shall raise him up ; and if he have committed sins , they shall be forgiven him .
KJV	James	5	16	Confess your faults one to another , and pray one for another , that ye may be healed . The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much .
KJV	James	5	17	Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain : and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months .
KJV	James	5	18	And he prayed again , and the heaven gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit .
KJV	James	5	19	Brethren , if any of you do err from the truth , and one convert him ;
KJV	James	5	20	Let him know , that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death , and shall hide a multitude of sins .
KJV	1%20Peter	1	1	Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
KJV	1%20Peter	1	2	Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , through sanctification of the Spirit , unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ : Grace unto you , and peace , be multiplied .
KJV	1%20Peter	1	3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
KJV	1%20Peter	1	4	To an inheritance incorruptible , and undefiled , and that fadeth not away , reserved in heaven for you ,
KJV	1%20Peter	1	5	Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
KJV	1%20Peter	1	6	Wherein ye greatly rejoice , though now for a season , if need be , ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations :
KJV	1%20Peter	1	7	That the trial of your faith , being much more precious than of gold that perisheth , though it be tried with fire , might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ :
KJV	1%20Peter	1	8	Whom having not seen , ye love ; in whom , though now ye see him not , yet believing , ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory :
KJV	1%20Peter	1	9	Receiving the end of your faith , even the salvation of your souls .
KJV	1%20Peter	1	10	Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently , who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you :
KJV	1%20Peter	1	11	Searching what , or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify , when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ , and the glory that should follow .
KJV	1%20Peter	1	12	Unto whom it was revealed , that not unto themselves , but unto us they did minister the things , which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven ; which things the angels desire to look into .
KJV	1%20Peter	1	13	Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind , be sober , and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ ;
KJV	1%20Peter	1	14	As obedient children , not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance :
KJV	1%20Peter	1	15	But as he which hath called you is holy , so be ye holy in all manner of conversation ;
KJV	1%20Peter	1	16	Because it is written , Be ye holy ; for I am holy .
KJV	1%20Peter	1	17	And if ye call on the Father , who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man 's work , pass the time of your sojourning here in fear :
KJV	1%20Peter	1	18	Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things , as silver and gold , from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers ;
KJV	1%20Peter	1	19	But with the precious blood of Christ , as of a lamb without blemish and without spot :
KJV	1%20Peter	1	20	Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world , but was manifest in these last times for you ,
KJV	1%20Peter	1	21	Who by him do believe in God , that raised him up from the dead , and gave him glory ; that your faith and hope might be in God .
KJV	1%20Peter	1	22	Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren , see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently :
KJV	1%20Peter	1	23	Being born again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , by the word of God , which liveth and abideth for ever .
KJV	1%20Peter	1	24	For all flesh is as grass , and all the glory of man as the flower of grass . The grass withereth , and the flower thereof falleth away :
KJV	1%20Peter	1	25	But the word of the Lord endureth for ever . And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you .
KJV	1%20Peter	2	1	Peter
KJV	1%20Peter	2	2	As newborn babes , desire the sincere milk of the word , that ye may grow thereby :
KJV	1%20Peter	2	3	If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious .
KJV	1%20Peter	2	4	To whom coming , as unto a living stone , disallowed indeed of men , but chosen of God , and precious ,
KJV	1%20Peter	2	5	Ye also , as lively stones , are built up a spiritual house , an holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God by Jesus Christ .
KJV	1%20Peter	2	6	Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture , Behold , I lay in Sion a chief corner stone , elect , precious : and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded .
KJV	1%20Peter	2	7	Unto you therefore which believe he is precious : but unto them which be disobedient , the stone which the builders disallowed , the same is made the head of the corner ,
KJV	1%20Peter	2	8	And a stone of stumbling , and a rock of offence , even to them which stumble at the word , being disobedient : whereunto also they were appointed .
KJV	1%20Peter	2	9	But ye are a chosen generation , a royal priesthood , an holy nation , a peculiar people ; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light ;
KJV	1%20Peter	2	10	Which in time past were not a people , but are now the people of God : which had not obtained mercy , but now have obtained mercy .
KJV	1%20Peter	2	11	Dearly beloved , I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims , abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against the soul ;
KJV	1%20Peter	2	12	Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles : that , whereas they speak against you as evildoers , they may by your good works , which they shall behold , glorify God in the day of visitation .
KJV	1%20Peter	2	13	Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord 's sake : whether it be to the king , as supreme ;
KJV	1%20Peter	2	14	Or unto governors , as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers , and for the praise of them that do well .
KJV	1%20Peter	2	15	For so is the will of God , that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men :
KJV	1%20Peter	2	16	As free , and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness , but as the servants of God .
KJV	1%20Peter	2	17	Honour all men . Love the brotherhood . Fear God . Honour the king .
KJV	1%20Peter	2	18	Servants , be subject to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the froward .
KJV	1%20Peter	2	19	For this is thankworthy , if a man for conscience toward God endure grief , suffering wrongfully .
KJV	1%20Peter	2	20	For what glory is it , if , when ye be buffeted for your faults , ye shall take it patiently ? but if , when ye do well , and suffer for it , ye take it patiently , this is acceptable with God .
KJV	1%20Peter	2	21	For even hereunto were ye called : because Christ also suffered for us , leaving us an example , that ye should follow his steps :
KJV	1%20Peter	2	22	Who did no sin , neither was guile found in his mouth :
KJV	1%20Peter	2	23	Who , when he was reviled , reviled not again ; when he suffered , he threatened not ; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously :
KJV	1%20Peter	2	24	Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree , that we , being dead to sins , should live unto righteousness : by whose stripes ye were healed .
KJV	1%20Peter	2	25	For ye were as sheep going astray ; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls .
KJV	1%20Peter	3	1	Peter
KJV	1%20Peter	3	3	Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair , and of wearing of gold , or of putting on of apparel ;
KJV	1%20Peter	3	2	While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear .
KJV	1%20Peter	3	4	But let it be the hidden man of the heart , in that which is not corruptible , even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God of great price .
KJV	1%20Peter	3	5	For after this manner in the old time the holy women also , who trusted in God , adorned themselves , being in subjection unto their own husbands :
KJV	1%20Peter	3	6	Even as Sara obeyed Abraham , calling him lord : whose daughters ye are , as long as ye do well , and are not afraid with any amazement .
KJV	1%20Peter	3	7	Likewise , ye husbands , dwell with them according to knowledge , giving honour unto the wife , as unto the weaker vessel , and as being heirs together of the grace of life ; that your prayers be not hindered .
KJV	1%20Peter	3	8	Finally , be ye all of one mind , having compassion one of another , love as brethren , be pitiful , be courteous :
KJV	1%20Peter	3	9	Not rendering evil for evil , or railing for railing : but contrariwise blessing ; knowing that ye are thereunto called , that ye should inherit a blessing .
KJV	1%20Peter	3	10	For he that will love life , and see good days , let him refrain his tongue from evil , and his lips that they speak no guile :
KJV	1%20Peter	3	11	Let him eschew evil , and do good ; let him seek peace , and ensue it .
KJV	1%20Peter	3	12	For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous , and his ears are open unto their prayers : but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil .
KJV	1%20Peter	3	13	And who is he that will harm you , if ye be followers of that which is good ?
KJV	1%20Peter	3	14	But and if ye suffer for righteousness ' sake , happy are ye : and be not afraid of their terror , neither be troubled ;
KJV	1%20Peter	3	15	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear :
KJV	1%20Peter	3	16	Having a good conscience ; that , whereas they speak evil of you , as of evildoers , they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ .
KJV	1%20Peter	3	17	For it is better , if the will of God be so , that ye suffer for well doing , than for evil doing .
KJV	1%20Peter	3	18	For Christ also hath once suffered for sins , the just for the unjust , that he might bring us to God , being put to death in the flesh , but quickened by the Spirit :
KJV	1%20Peter	3	19	By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison ;
KJV	1%20Peter	3	20	Which sometime were disobedient , when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah , while the ark was a preparing , wherein few , that is , eight souls were saved by water .
KJV	1%20Peter	3	21	The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us ( not the putting away of the filth of the flesh , but the answer of a good conscience toward God , ) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ :
KJV	1%20Peter	3	22	Who is gone into heaven , and is on the right hand of God ; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him .
KJV	1%20Peter	4	1	Peter
KJV	1%20Peter	4	4	Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot , speaking evil of you :
KJV	1%20Peter	4	2	That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men , but to the will of God .
KJV	1%20Peter	4	3	For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles , when we walked in lasciviousness , lusts , excess of wine , revellings , banquetings , and abominable idolatries :
KJV	1%20Peter	4	5	Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead .
KJV	1%20Peter	4	6	For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead , that they might be judged according to men in the flesh , but live according to God in the spirit .
KJV	1%20Peter	4	7	But the end of all things is at hand : be ye therefore sober , and watch unto prayer .
KJV	1%20Peter	4	8	And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves : for charity shall cover the multitude of sins .
KJV	1%20Peter	4	9	Use hospitality one to another without grudging .
KJV	1%20Peter	4	10	As every man hath received the gift , even so minister the same one to another , as good stewards of the manifold grace of God .
KJV	1%20Peter	4	11	If any man speak , let him speak as the oracles of God ; if any man minister , let him do it as of the ability which God giveth : that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ , to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
KJV	1%20Peter	4	12	Beloved , think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you , as though some strange thing happened unto you :
KJV	1%20Peter	4	13	But rejoice , inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ 's sufferings ; that , when his glory shall be revealed , ye may be glad also with exceeding joy .
KJV	1%20Peter	4	14	If ye be reproached for the name of Christ , happy are ye ; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you : on their part he is evil spoken of , but on your part he is glorified .
KJV	1%20Peter	4	15	But let none of you suffer as a murderer , or as a thief , or as an evildoer , or as a busybody in other men 's matters .
KJV	1%20Peter	4	16	Yet if any man suffer as a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify God on this behalf .
KJV	1%20Peter	4	17	For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God : and if it first begin at us , what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God ?
KJV	1%20Peter	4	18	And if the righteous scarcely be saved , where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear ?
KJV	1%20Peter	4	19	Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing , as unto a faithful Creator .
KJV	1%20Peter	5	1	Peter
KJV	1%20Peter	5	5	Likewise , ye younger , submit yourselves unto the elder . Yea , all of you be subject one to another , and be clothed with humility : for God resisteth the proud , and giveth grace to the humble .
KJV	1%20Peter	5	2	Feed the flock of God which is among you , taking the oversight thereof , not by constraint , but willingly ; not for filthy lucre , but of a ready mind ;
KJV	1%20Peter	5	3	Neither as being lords over God 's heritage , but being examples to the flock .
KJV	1%20Peter	5	4	And when the chief Shepherd shall appear , ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away .
KJV	1%20Peter	5	6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God , that he may exalt you in due time :
KJV	1%20Peter	5	7	Casting all your care upon him ; for he careth for you .
KJV	1%20Peter	5	8	Be sober , be vigilant ; because your adversary the devil , as a roaring lion , walketh about , seeking whom he may devour :
KJV	1%20Peter	5	9	Whom resist stedfast in the faith , knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world .
KJV	1%20Peter	5	10	But the God of all grace , who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus , after that ye have suffered a while , make you perfect , stablish , strengthen , settle you .
KJV	1%20Peter	5	11	To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
KJV	1%20Peter	5	12	By Silvanus , a faithful brother unto you , as I suppose , I have written briefly , exhorting , and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand .
KJV	1%20Peter	5	13	The church that is at Babylon , elected together with you , saluteth you ; and so doth Marcus my son .
KJV	1%20Peter	5	14	Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity . Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus . Amen .
KJV	2%20Peter	1	2	Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God , and of Jesus our Lord ,
KJV	2%20Peter	1	1	Simon Peter , a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ , to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ :
KJV	2%20Peter	1	3	According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness , through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue :
KJV	2%20Peter	1	4	Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises : that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature , having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust .
KJV	2%20Peter	1	5	And beside this , giving all diligence , add to your faith virtue ; and to virtue knowledge ;
KJV	2%20Peter	1	6	And to knowledge temperance ; and to temperance patience ; and to patience godliness ;
KJV	2%20Peter	1	7	And to godliness brotherly kindness ; and to brotherly kindness charity .
KJV	2%20Peter	1	8	For if these things be in you , and abound , they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	2%20Peter	1	9	But he that lacketh these things is blind , and can not see afar off , and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins .
KJV	2%20Peter	1	10	Wherefore the rather , brethren , give diligence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never fall :
KJV	2%20Peter	1	11	For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ .
KJV	2%20Peter	1	12	Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things , though ye know them , and be established in the present truth .
KJV	2%20Peter	1	13	Yea , I think it meet , as long as I am in this tabernacle , to stir you up by putting you in remembrance ;
KJV	2%20Peter	1	14	Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle , even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me .
KJV	2%20Peter	1	15	Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance .
KJV	2%20Peter	1	16	For we have not followed cunningly devised fables , when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
KJV	2%20Peter	1	17	For he received from God the Father honour and glory , when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
KJV	2%20Peter	1	18	And this voice which came from heaven we heard , when we were with him in the holy mount .
KJV	2%20Peter	1	19	We have also a more sure word of prophecy ; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed , as unto a light that shineth in a dark place , until the day dawn , and the day star arise in your hearts :
KJV	2%20Peter	1	20	Knowing this first , that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation .
KJV	2%20Peter	1	21	For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man : but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost .
KJV	2%20Peter	2	2	And many shall follow their pernicious ways ; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of .
KJV	2%20Peter	2	3	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you : whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not , and their damnation slumbereth not .
KJV	2%20Peter	2	4	For if God spared not the angels that sinned , but cast them down to hell , and delivered them into chains of darkness , to be reserved unto judgment ;
KJV	2%20Peter	2	5	And spared not the old world , but saved Noah the eighth person , a preacher of righteousness , bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly ;
KJV	2%20Peter	2	6	And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow , making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly ;
KJV	2%20Peter	2	7	And delivered just Lot , vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked :
KJV	2%20Peter	2	8	( For that righteous man dwelling among them , in seeing and hearing , vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds ; )
KJV	2%20Peter	2	9	The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations , and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished :
KJV	2%20Peter	2	10	But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness , and despise government . Presumptuous are they , selfwilled , they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities .
KJV	2%20Peter	2	11	Whereas angels , which are greater in power and might , bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord .
KJV	2%20Peter	2	12	But these , as natural brute beasts , made to be taken and destroyed , speak evil of the things that they understand not ; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption ;
KJV	2%20Peter	2	13	And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness , as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time . Spots they are and blemishes , sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you ;
KJV	2%20Peter	2	14	Having eyes full of adultery , and that can not cease from sin ; beguiling unstable souls : an heart they have exercised with covetous practices ; cursed children :
KJV	2%20Peter	2	15	Which have forsaken the right way , and are gone astray , following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor , who loved the wages of unrighteousness ;
KJV	2%20Peter	2	16	But was rebuked for his iniquity : the dumb ass speaking with man 's voice forbad the madness of the prophet .
KJV	2%20Peter	2	17	These are wells without water , clouds that are carried with a tempest ; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever .
KJV	2%20Peter	2	18	For when they speak great swelling words of vanity , they allure through the lusts of the flesh , through much wantonness , those that were clean escaped from them who live in error .
KJV	2%20Peter	2	19	While they promise them liberty , they themselves are the servants of corruption : for of whom a man is overcome , of the same is he brought in bondage .
KJV	2%20Peter	2	20	For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again entangled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
KJV	2%20Peter	2	21	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than , after they have known it , to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them .
KJV	2%20Peter	2	22	But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb , The dog is turned to his own vomit again ; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire .
KJV	2%20Peter	3	2	That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour :
KJV	2%20Peter	3	3	Knowing this first , that there shall come in the last days scoffers , walking after their own lusts ,
KJV	2%20Peter	3	4	And saying , Where is the promise of his coming ? for since the fathers fell asleep , all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation .
KJV	2%20Peter	3	5	For this they willingly are ignorant of , that by the word of God the heavens were of old , and the earth standing out of the water and in the water :
KJV	2%20Peter	3	6	Whereby the world that then was , being overflowed with water , perished :
KJV	2%20Peter	3	7	But the heavens and the earth , which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men .
KJV	2%20Peter	3	8	But , beloved , be not ignorant of this one thing , that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
KJV	2%20Peter	3	9	The Lord is not slack concerning his promise , as some men count slackness ; but is longsuffering to us-ward , not willing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
KJV	2%20Peter	3	10	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night ; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat , the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up .
KJV	2%20Peter	3	11	Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved , what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness ,
KJV	2%20Peter	3	12	Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God , wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat ?
KJV	2%20Peter	3	13	Nevertheless we , according to his promise , look for new heavens and a new earth , wherein dwelleth righteousness .
KJV	2%20Peter	3	14	Wherefore , beloved , seeing that ye look for such things , be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace , without spot , and blameless .
KJV	2%20Peter	3	15	And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you ;
KJV	2%20Peter	3	16	As also in all his epistles , speaking in them of these things ; in which are some things hard to be understood , which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest , as they do also the other scriptures , unto their own destruction .
KJV	2%20Peter	3	17	Ye therefore , beloved , seeing ye know these things before , beware lest ye also , being led away with the error of the wicked , fall from your own stedfastness .
KJV	2%20Peter	3	18	But grow in grace , and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . To him be glory both now and for ever . Amen .
KJV	1%20John	1	1	That which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the Word of life ;
KJV	1%20John	1	2	( For the life was manifested , and we have seen it , and bear witness , and shew unto you that eternal life , which was with the Father , and was manifested unto us ; )
KJV	1%20John	1	3	That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you , that ye also may have fellowship with us : and truly our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son Jesus Christ .
KJV	1%20John	1	4	And these things write we unto you , that your joy may be full .
KJV	1%20John	1	5	This then is the message which we have heard of him , and declare unto you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
KJV	1%20John	1	6	If we say that we have fellowship with him , and walk in darkness , we lie , and do not the truth :
KJV	1%20John	1	7	But if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship one with another , and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin .
KJV	1%20John	1	8	If we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
KJV	1%20John	1	9	If we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
KJV	1%20John	1	10	If we say that we have not sinned , we make him a liar , and his word is not in us .
KJV	1%20John	2	1	John
KJV	1%20John	2	2	And he is the propitiation for our sins : and not for ours only , but also for the sins of the whole world .
KJV	1%20John	2	3	And hereby we do know that we know him , if we keep his commandments .
KJV	1%20John	2	4	He that saith , I know him , and keepeth not his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in him .
KJV	1%20John	2	5	But whoso keepeth his word , in him verily is the love of God perfected : hereby know we that we are in him .
KJV	1%20John	2	6	He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk , even as he walked .
KJV	1%20John	2	7	Brethren , I write no new commandment unto you , but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning . The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning .
KJV	1%20John	2	8	Again , a new commandment I write unto you , which thing is true in him and in you : because the darkness is past , and the true light now shineth .
KJV	1%20John	2	9	He that saith he is in the light , and hateth his brother , is in darkness even until now .
KJV	1%20John	2	10	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light , and there is none occasion of stumbling in him .
KJV	1%20John	2	11	But he that hateth his brother is in darkness , and walketh in darkness , and knoweth not whither he goeth , because that darkness hath blinded his eyes .
KJV	1%20John	2	12	I write unto you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name 's sake .
KJV	1%20John	2	13	I write unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I write unto you , young men , because ye have overcome the wicked one . I write unto you , little children , because ye have known the Father .
KJV	1%20John	2	14	I have written unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I have written unto you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of God abideth in you , and ye have overcome the wicked one .
KJV	1%20John	2	15	Love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . If any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
KJV	1%20John	2	16	For all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
KJV	1%20John	2	17	And the world passeth away , and the lust thereof : but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever .
KJV	1%20John	2	18	Little children , it is the last time : and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come , even now are there many antichrists ; whereby we know that it is the last time .
KJV	1%20John	2	19	They went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would no doubt have continued with us : but they went out , that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us .
KJV	1%20John	2	20	But ye have an unction from the Holy One , and ye know all things .
KJV	1%20John	2	21	I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth , but because ye know it , and that no lie is of the truth .
KJV	1%20John	2	22	Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ ? He is antichrist , that denieth the Father and the Son .
KJV	1%20John	2	23	Whosoever denieth the Son , the same hath not the Father : he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also .
KJV	1%20John	2	24	Let that therefore abide in you , which ye have heard from the beginning . If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the Son , and in the Father .
KJV	1%20John	2	25	And this is the promise that he hath promised us , even eternal life .
KJV	1%20John	2	26	These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you .
KJV	1%20John	2	27	But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you , and ye need not that any man teach you : but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things , and is truth , and is no lie , and even as it hath taught you , ye shall abide in him .
KJV	1%20John	2	28	And now , little children , abide in him ; that , when he shall appear , we may have confidence , and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
KJV	1%20John	2	29	If ye know that he is righteous , ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him .
KJV	1%20John	3	1	John
KJV	1%20John	3	3	And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself , even as he is pure .
KJV	1%20John	3	2	Beloved , now are we the sons of God , and it doth not yet appear what we shall be : but we know that , when he shall appear , we shall be like him ; for we shall see him as he is .
KJV	1%20John	3	4	Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law : for sin is the transgression of the law .
KJV	1%20John	3	5	And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins ; and in him is no sin .
KJV	1%20John	3	6	Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not : whosoever sinneth hath not seen him , neither known him .
KJV	1%20John	3	7	Little children , let no man deceive you : he that doeth righteousness is righteous , even as he is righteous .
KJV	1%20John	3	8	He that committeth sin is of the devil ; for the devil sinneth from the beginning . For this purpose the Son of God was manifested , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
KJV	1%20John	3	9	Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin ; for his seed remaineth in him : and he can not sin , because he is born of God .
KJV	1%20John	3	10	In this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God , neither he that loveth not his brother .
KJV	1%20John	3	11	For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning , that we should love one another .
KJV	1%20John	3	12	Not as Cain , who was of that wicked one , and slew his brother . And wherefore slew he him ? Because his own works were evil , and his brother 's righteous .
KJV	1%20John	3	13	Marvel not , my brethren , if the world hate you .
KJV	1%20John	3	14	We know that we have passed from death unto life , because we love the brethren . He that loveth not his brother abideth in death .
KJV	1%20John	3	15	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer : and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him .
KJV	1%20John	3	16	Hereby perceive we the love of God , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
KJV	1%20John	3	17	But whoso hath this world 's good , and seeth his brother have need , and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him , how dwelleth the love of God in him ?
KJV	1%20John	3	18	My little children , let us not love in word , neither in tongue ; but in deed and in truth .
KJV	1%20John	3	19	And hereby we know that we are of the truth , and shall assure our hearts before him .
KJV	1%20John	3	20	For if our heart condemn us , God is greater than our heart , and knoweth all things .
KJV	1%20John	3	21	Beloved , if our heart condemn us not , then have we confidence toward God .
KJV	1%20John	3	22	And whatsoever we ask , we receive of him , because we keep his commandments , and do those things that are pleasing in his sight .
KJV	1%20John	3	23	And this is his commandment , That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ , and love one another , as he gave us commandment .
KJV	1%20John	3	24	And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him , and he in him . And hereby we know that he abideth in us , by the Spirit which he hath given us .
KJV	1%20John	4	1	John
KJV	1%20John	4	4	Ye are of God , little children , and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you , than he that is in the world .
KJV	1%20John	4	2	Hereby know ye the Spirit of God : Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God :
KJV	1%20John	4	3	And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God : and this is that spirit of antichrist , whereof ye have heard that it should come ; and even now already is it in the world .
KJV	1%20John	4	5	They are of the world : therefore speak they of the world , and the world heareth them .
KJV	1%20John	4	6	We are of God : he that knoweth God heareth us ; he that is not of God heareth not us . Hereby know we the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
KJV	1%20John	4	7	Beloved , let us love one another : for love is of God ; and every one that loveth is born of God , and knoweth God .
KJV	1%20John	4	8	He that loveth not knoweth not God ; for God is love .
KJV	1%20John	4	9	In this was manifested the love of God toward us , because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world , that we might live through him .
KJV	1%20John	4	10	Herein is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins .
KJV	1%20John	4	11	Beloved , if God so loved us , we ought also to love one another .
KJV	1%20John	4	12	No man hath seen God at any time . If we love one another , God dwelleth in us , and his love is perfected in us .
KJV	1%20John	4	13	Hereby know we that we dwell in him , and he in us , because he hath given us of his Spirit .
KJV	1%20John	4	14	And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world .
KJV	1%20John	4	15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God , God dwelleth in him , and he in God .
KJV	1%20John	4	16	And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us . God is love ; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God , and God in him .
KJV	1%20John	4	17	Herein is our love made perfect , that we may have boldness in the day of judgment : because as he is , so are we in this world .
KJV	1%20John	4	18	There is no fear in love ; but perfect love casteth out fear : because fear hath torment . He that feareth is not made perfect in love .
KJV	1%20John	4	19	We love him , because he first loved us .
KJV	1%20John	4	20	If a man say , I love God , and hateth his brother , he is a liar : for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ?
KJV	1%20John	4	21	And this commandment have we from him , That he who loveth God love his brother also .
KJV	1%20John	5	1	John
KJV	1%20John	5	5	Who is he that overcometh the world , but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God ?
KJV	1%20John	5	2	By this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God , and keep his commandments .
KJV	1%20John	5	3	For this is the love of God , that we keep his commandments : and his commandments are not grievous .
KJV	1%20John	5	4	For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world : and this is the victory that overcometh the world , even our faith .
KJV	1%20John	5	6	This is he that came by water and blood , even Jesus Christ ; not by water only , but by water and blood . And it is the Spirit that beareth witness , because the Spirit is truth .
KJV	1%20John	5	7	For there are three that bear record in heaven , the Father , the Word , and the Holy Ghost : and these three are one .
KJV	1%20John	5	8	And there are three that bear witness in earth , the Spirit , and the water , and the blood : and these three agree in one .
KJV	1%20John	5	9	If we receive the witness of men , the witness of God is greater : for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son .
KJV	1%20John	5	10	He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself : he that believeth not God hath made him a liar ; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son .
KJV	1%20John	5	11	And this is the record , that God hath given to us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
KJV	1%20John	5	12	He that hath the Son hath life ; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life .
KJV	1%20John	5	13	These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God ; that ye may know that ye have eternal life , and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God .
KJV	1%20John	5	14	And this is the confidence that we have in him , that , if we ask any thing according to his will , he heareth us :
KJV	1%20John	5	15	And if we know that he hear us , whatsoever we ask , we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him .
KJV	1%20John	5	16	If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death , he shall ask , and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death . There is a sin unto death : I do not say that he shall pray for it .
KJV	1%20John	5	17	All unrighteousness is sin : and there is a sin not unto death .
KJV	1%20John	5	18	We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not ; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself , and that wicked one toucheth him not .
KJV	1%20John	5	19	And we know that we are of God , and the whole world lieth in wickedness .
KJV	1%20John	5	20	And we know that the Son of God is come , and hath given us an understanding , that we may know him that is true , and we are in him that is true , even in his Son Jesus Christ . This is the true God , and eternal life .
KJV	1%20John	5	21	Little children , keep yourselves from idols . Amen .
KJV	2%20John	1	2	For the truth 's sake , which dwelleth in us , and shall be with us for ever .
KJV	2%20John	1	1	The elder unto the elect lady and her children , whom I love in the truth ; and not I only , but also all they that have known the truth ;
KJV	2%20John	1	3	Grace be with you , mercy , and peace , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
KJV	2%20John	1	4	I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth , as we have received a commandment from the Father .
KJV	2%20John	1	5	And now I beseech thee , lady , not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee , but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
KJV	2%20John	1	6	And this is love , that we walk after his commandments . This is the commandment , That , as ye have heard from the beginning , ye should walk in it .
KJV	2%20John	1	7	For many deceivers are entered into the world , who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh . This is a deceiver and an antichrist .
KJV	2%20John	1	8	Look to yourselves , that we lose not those things which we have wrought , but that we receive a full reward .
KJV	2%20John	1	9	Whosoever transgresseth , and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ , hath not God . He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ , he hath both the Father and the Son .
KJV	2%20John	1	10	If there come any unto you , and bring not this doctrine , receive him not into your house , neither bid him God speed :
KJV	2%20John	1	11	For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds .
KJV	2%20John	1	12	Having many things to write unto you , I would not write with paper and ink : but I trust to come unto you , and speak face to face , that our joy may be full .
KJV	2%20John	1	13	The children of thy elect sister greet thee . Amen .
KJV	3%20John	1	3	For I rejoiced greatly , when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee , even as thou walkest in the truth .
KJV	3%20John	1	1	The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius , whom I love in the truth .
KJV	3%20John	1	2	Beloved , I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health , even as thy soul prospereth .
KJV	3%20John	1	4	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth .
KJV	3%20John	1	5	Beloved , thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren , and to strangers ;
KJV	3%20John	1	6	Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church : whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort , thou shalt do well :
KJV	3%20John	1	7	Because that for his name 's sake they went forth , taking nothing of the Gentiles .
KJV	3%20John	1	8	We therefore ought to receive such , that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth .
KJV	3%20John	1	9	I wrote unto the church : but Diotrephes , who loveth to have the preeminence among them , receiveth us not .
KJV	3%20John	1	10	Wherefore , if I come , I will remember his deeds which he doeth , prating against us with malicious words : and not content therewith , neither doth he himself receive the brethren , and forbiddeth them that would , and casteth them out of the church .
KJV	3%20John	1	11	Beloved , follow not that which is evil , but that which is good . He that doeth good is of God : but he that doeth evil hath not seen God .
KJV	3%20John	1	12	Demetrius hath good report of all men , and of the truth itself : yea , and we also bear record ; and ye know that our record is true .
KJV	3%20John	1	13	I had many things to write , but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee :
KJV	3%20John	1	14	But I trust I shall shortly see thee , and we shall speak face to face . Peace be to thee . Our friends salute thee . Greet the friends by name .
KJV	Jude	1	1	Jude , the servant of Jesus Christ , and brother of James , to them that are sanctified by God the Father , and preserved in Jesus Christ , and called :
KJV	Jude	1	2	Mercy unto you , and peace , and love , be multiplied .
KJV	Jude	1	3	Beloved , when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation , it was needful for me to write unto you , and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints .
KJV	Jude	1	4	For there are certain men crept in unawares , who were before of old ordained to this condemnation , ungodly men , turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness , and denying the only Lord God , and our Lord Jesus Christ .
KJV	Jude	1	5	I will therefore put you in remembrance , though ye once knew this , how that the Lord , having saved the people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed them that believed not .
KJV	Jude	1	6	And the angels which kept not their first estate , but left their own habitation , he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day .
KJV	Jude	1	7	Even as Sodom and Gomorrha , and the cities about them in like manner , giving themselves over to fornication , and going after strange flesh , are set forth for an example , suffering the vengeance of eternal fire .
KJV	Jude	1	8	Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh , despise dominion , and speak evil of dignities .
KJV	Jude	1	9	Yet Michael the archangel , when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses , durst not bring against him a railing accusation , but said , The Lord rebuke thee .
KJV	Jude	1	10	But these speak evil of those things which they know not : but what they know naturally , as brute beasts , in those things they corrupt themselves .
KJV	Jude	1	11	Woe unto them ! for they have gone in the way of Cain , and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward , and perished in the gainsaying of Core .
KJV	Jude	1	12	These are spots in your feasts of charity , when they feast with you , feeding themselves without fear : clouds they are without water , carried about of winds ; trees whose fruit withereth , without fruit , twice dead , plucked up by the roots ;
KJV	Jude	1	13	Raging waves of the sea , foaming out their own shame ; wandering stars , to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever .
KJV	Jude	1	14	And Enoch also , the seventh from Adam , prophesied of these , saying , Behold , the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints ,
KJV	Jude	1	15	To execute judgment upon all , and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed , and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him .
KJV	Jude	1	16	These are murmurers , complainers , walking after their own lusts ; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words , having men 's persons in admiration because of advantage .
KJV	Jude	1	17	But , beloved , remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
KJV	Jude	1	18	How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time , who should walk after their own ungodly lusts .
KJV	Jude	1	19	These be they who separate themselves , sensual , having not the Spirit .
KJV	Jude	1	20	But ye , beloved , building up yourselves on your most holy faith , praying in the Holy Ghost ,
KJV	Jude	1	21	Keep yourselves in the love of God , looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life .
KJV	Jude	1	22	And of some have compassion , making a difference :
KJV	Jude	1	23	And others save with fear , pulling them out of the fire ; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh .
KJV	Jude	1	24	Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling , and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy ,
KJV	Jude	1	25	To the only wise God our Saviour , be glory and majesty , dominion and power , both now and ever . Amen .
KJV	Revelation	1	1	The Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave unto him , to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass ; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John :
KJV	Revelation	1	2	Who bare record of the word of God , and of the testimony of Jesus Christ , and of all things that he saw .
KJV	Revelation	1	3	Blessed is he that readeth , and they that hear the words of this prophecy , and keep those things which are written therein : for the time is at hand .
KJV	Revelation	1	4	John to the seven churches which are in Asia : Grace be unto you , and peace , from him which is , and which was , and which is to come ; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne ;
KJV	Revelation	1	5	And from Jesus Christ , who is the faithful witness , and the first begotten of the dead , and the prince of the kings of the earth . Unto him that loved us , and washed us from our sins in his own blood ,
KJV	Revelation	1	6	And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father ; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
KJV	Revelation	1	7	Behold , he cometh with clouds ; and every eye shall see him , and they also which pierced him : and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him . Even so , Amen .
KJV	Revelation	1	8	I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the ending , saith the Lord , which is , and which was , and which is to come , the Almighty .
KJV	Revelation	1	9	I John , who also am your brother , and companion in tribulation , and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ , was in the isle that is called Patmos , for the word of God , and for the testimony of Jesus Christ .
KJV	Revelation	1	10	I was in the Spirit on the Lord 's day , and heard behind me a great voice , as of a trumpet ,
KJV	Revelation	1	11	Saying , I am Alpha and Omega , the first and the last : and , What thou seest , write in a book , and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia ; unto Ephesus , and unto Smyrna , and unto Pergamos , and unto Thyatira , and unto Sardis , and unto Philadelphia , and unto Laodicea .
KJV	Revelation	1	12	And I turned to see the voice that spake with me . And being turned , I saw seven golden candlesticks ;
KJV	Revelation	1	13	And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man , clothed with a garment down to the foot , and girt about the paps with a golden girdle .
KJV	Revelation	1	14	His head and his hairs were white like wool , as white as snow ; and his eyes were as a flame of fire ;
KJV	Revelation	1	15	And his feet like unto fine brass , as if they burned in a furnace ; and his voice as the sound of many waters .
KJV	Revelation	1	16	And he had in his right hand seven stars : and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword : and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength .
KJV	Revelation	1	17	And when I saw him , I fell at his feet as dead . And he laid his right hand upon me , saying unto me , Fear not ; I am the first and the last :
KJV	Revelation	1	18	I am he that liveth , and was dead ; and , behold , I am alive for evermore , Amen ; and have the keys of hell and of death .
KJV	Revelation	1	19	Write the things which thou hast seen , and the things which are , and the things which shall be hereafter ;
KJV	Revelation	1	20	The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand , and the seven golden candlesticks . The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches : and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches .
KJV	Revelation	2	2	I know thy works , and thy labour , and thy patience , and how thou canst not bear them which are evil : and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles , and are not , and hast found them liars :
KJV	Revelation	2	3	And hast borne , and hast patience , and for my name 's sake hast laboured , and hast not fainted .
KJV	Revelation	2	4	Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee , because thou hast left thy first love .
KJV	Revelation	2	5	Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen , and repent , and do the first works ; or else I will come unto thee quickly , and will remove thy candlestick out of his place , except thou repent .
KJV	Revelation	2	6	But this thou hast , that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes , which I also hate .
KJV	Revelation	2	7	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the midst of the paradise of God .
KJV	Revelation	2	8	And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write ; These things saith the first and the last , which was dead , and is alive ;
KJV	Revelation	2	9	I know thy works , and tribulation , and poverty , ( but thou art rich ) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews , and are not , but are the synagogue of Satan .
KJV	Revelation	2	10	Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer : behold , the devil shall cast some of you into prison , that ye may be tried ; and ye shall have tribulation ten days : be thou faithful unto death , and I will give thee a crown of life .
KJV	Revelation	2	11	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death .
KJV	Revelation	2	12	And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write ; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges ;
KJV	Revelation	2	13	I know thy works , and where thou dwellest , even where Satan 's seat is : and thou holdest fast my name , and hast not denied my faith , even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr , who was slain among you , where Satan dwelleth .
KJV	Revelation	2	14	But I have a few things against thee , because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam , who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel , to eat things sacrificed unto idols , and to commit fornication .
KJV	Revelation	2	15	So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes , which thing I hate .
KJV	Revelation	2	16	Repent ; or else I will come unto thee quickly , and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth .
KJV	Revelation	2	17	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna , and will give him a white stone , and in the stone a new name written , which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it .
KJV	Revelation	2	18	And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write ; These things saith the Son of God , who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire , and his feet are like fine brass ;
KJV	Revelation	2	19	I know thy works , and charity , and service , and faith , and thy patience , and thy works ; and the last to be more than the first .
KJV	Revelation	2	20	Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee , because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel , which calleth herself a prophetess , to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication , and to eat things sacrificed unto idols .
KJV	Revelation	2	21	And I gave her space to repent of her fornication ; and she repented not .
KJV	Revelation	2	22	Behold , I will cast her into a bed , and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation , except they repent of their deeds .
KJV	Revelation	2	23	And I will kill her children with death ; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts : and I will give unto every one of you according to your works .
KJV	Revelation	2	24	But unto you I say , and unto the rest in Thyatira , as many as have not this doctrine , and which have not known the depths of Satan , as they speak ; I will put upon you none other burden .
KJV	Revelation	2	25	But that which ye have already hold fast till I come .
KJV	Revelation	2	26	And he that overcometh , and keepeth my works unto the end , to him will I give power over the nations :
KJV	Revelation	2	27	And he shall rule them with a rod of iron ; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers : even as I received of my Father .
KJV	Revelation	2	28	And I will give him the morning star .
KJV	Revelation	2	29	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
KJV	Revelation	3	3	Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard , and hold fast , and repent . If therefore thou shalt not watch , I will come on thee as a thief , and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee .
KJV	Revelation	3	2	Be watchful , and strengthen the things which remain , that are ready to die : for I have not found thy works perfect before God .
KJV	Revelation	3	4	Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments ; and they shall walk with me in white : for they are worthy .
KJV	Revelation	3	5	He that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life , but I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
KJV	Revelation	3	6	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
KJV	Revelation	3	7	And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write ; These things saith he that is holy , he that is true , he that hath the key of David , he that openeth , and no man shutteth ; and shutteth , and no man openeth ;
KJV	Revelation	3	8	I know thy works : behold , I have set before thee an open door , and no man can shut it : for thou hast a little strength , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my name .
KJV	Revelation	3	9	Behold , I will make them of the synagogue of Satan , which say they are Jews , and are not , but do lie ; behold , I will make them to come and worship before thy feet , and to know that I have loved thee .
KJV	Revelation	3	10	Because thou hast kept the word of my patience , I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that dwell upon the earth .
KJV	Revelation	3	11	Behold , I come quickly : hold that fast which thou hast , that no man take thy crown .
KJV	Revelation	3	12	Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God , and he shall go no more out : and I will write upon him the name of my God , and the name of the city of my God , which is new Jerusalem , which cometh down out of heaven from my God : and I will write upon him my new name .
KJV	Revelation	3	13	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
KJV	Revelation	3	14	And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write ; These things saith the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the beginning of the creation of God ;
KJV	Revelation	3	15	I know thy works , that thou art neither cold nor hot : I would thou wert cold or hot .
KJV	Revelation	3	16	So then because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I will spue thee out of my mouth .
KJV	Revelation	3	17	Because thou sayest , I am rich , and increased with goods , and have need of nothing ; and knowest not that thou art wretched , and miserable , and poor , and blind , and naked :
KJV	Revelation	3	18	I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire , that thou mayest be rich ; and white raiment , that thou mayest be clothed , and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear ; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve , that thou mayest see .
KJV	Revelation	3	19	As many as I love , I rebuke and chasten : be zealous therefore , and repent .
KJV	Revelation	3	20	Behold , I stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me .
KJV	Revelation	3	21	To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne , even as I also overcame , and am set down with my Father in his throne .
KJV	Revelation	3	22	He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
KJV	Revelation	4	4	And round about the throne were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting , clothed in white raiment ; and they had on their heads crowns of gold .
KJV	Revelation	4	2	And immediately I was in the spirit : and , behold , a throne was set in heaven , and one sat on the throne .
KJV	Revelation	4	3	And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone : and there was a rainbow round about the throne , in sight like unto an emerald .
KJV	Revelation	4	5	And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices : and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven Spirits of God .
KJV	Revelation	4	6	And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal : and in the midst of the throne , and round about the throne , were four beasts full of eyes before and behind .
KJV	Revelation	4	7	And the first beast was like a lion , and the second beast like a calf , and the third beast had a face as a man , and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle .
KJV	Revelation	4	8	And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him ; and they were full of eyes within : and they rest not day and night , saying , Holy , holy , holy , Lord God Almighty , which was , and is , and is to come .
KJV	Revelation	4	9	And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne , who liveth for ever and ever ,
KJV	Revelation	4	10	The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne , and worship him that liveth for ever and ever , and cast their crowns before the throne , saying ,
KJV	Revelation	4	11	Thou art worthy , O Lord , to receive glory and honour and power : for thou hast created all things , and for thy pleasure they are and were created .
KJV	Revelation	5	5	And one of the elders saith unto me , Weep not : behold , the Lion of the tribe of Judah , the Root of David , hath prevailed to open the book , and to loose the seven seals thereof .
KJV	Revelation	5	2	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice , Who is worthy to open the book , and to loose the seals thereof ?
KJV	Revelation	5	3	And no man in heaven , nor in earth , neither under the earth , was able to open the book , neither to look thereon .
KJV	Revelation	5	4	And I wept much , because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book , neither to look thereon .
KJV	Revelation	5	6	And I beheld , and , lo , in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts , and in the midst of the elders , stood a Lamb as it had been slain , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth .
KJV	Revelation	5	7	And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne .
KJV	Revelation	5	8	And when he had taken the book , the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb , having every one of them harps , and golden vials full of odours , which are the prayers of saints .
KJV	Revelation	5	9	And they sung a new song , saying , Thou art worthy to take the book , and to open the seals thereof : for thou wast slain , and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred , and tongue , and people , and nation ;
KJV	Revelation	5	10	And hast made us unto our God kings and priests : and we shall reign on the earth .
KJV	Revelation	5	11	And I beheld , and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders : and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands ;
KJV	Revelation	5	12	Saying with a loud voice , Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power , and riches , and wisdom , and strength , and honour , and glory , and blessing .
KJV	Revelation	5	13	And every creature which is in heaven , and on the earth , and under the earth , and such as are in the sea , and all that are in them , heard I saying , Blessing , and honour , and glory , and power , be unto him that sitteth upon the throne , and unto the Lamb for ever and ever .
KJV	Revelation	5	14	And the four beasts said , Amen . And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever .
KJV	Revelation	6	6	And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say , A measure of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny ; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine .
KJV	Revelation	6	2	And I saw , and behold a white horse : and he that sat on him had a bow ; and a crown was given unto him : and he went forth conquering , and to conquer .
KJV	Revelation	6	3	And when he had opened the second seal , I heard the second beast say , Come and see .
KJV	Revelation	6	4	And there went out another horse that was red : and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth , and that they should kill one another : and there was given unto him a great sword .
KJV	Revelation	6	5	And when he had opened the third seal , I heard the third beast say , Come and see . And I beheld , and lo a black horse ; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand .
KJV	Revelation	6	7	And when he had opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth beast say , Come and see .
KJV	Revelation	6	8	And I looked , and behold a pale horse : and his name that sat on him was Death , and Hell followed with him . And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth , to kill with sword , and with hunger , and with death , and with the beasts of the earth .
KJV	Revelation	6	9	And when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
KJV	Revelation	6	10	And they cried with a loud voice , saying , How long , O Lord , holy and true , dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth ?
KJV	Revelation	6	11	And white robes were given unto every one of them ; and it was said unto them , that they should rest yet for a little season , until their fellowservants also and their brethren , that should be killed as they were , should be fulfilled .
KJV	Revelation	6	12	And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal , and , lo , there was a great earthquake ; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair , and the moon became as blood ;
KJV	Revelation	6	13	And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth , even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs , when she is shaken of a mighty wind .
KJV	Revelation	6	14	And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together ; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
KJV	Revelation	6	15	And the kings of the earth , and the great men , and the rich men , and the chief captains , and the mighty men , and every bondman , and every free man , hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains ;
KJV	Revelation	6	16	And said to the mountains and rocks , Fall on us , and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne , and from the wrath of the Lamb :
KJV	Revelation	6	17	For the great day of his wrath is come ; and who shall be able to stand ?
KJV	Revelation	7	7	Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand .
KJV	Revelation	7	2	And I saw another angel ascending from the east , having the seal of the living God : and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels , to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea ,
KJV	Revelation	7	3	Saying , Hurt not the earth , neither the sea , nor the trees , till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads .
KJV	Revelation	7	4	And I heard the number of them which were sealed : and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel .
KJV	Revelation	7	5	Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand .
KJV	Revelation	7	6	Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand .
KJV	Revelation	7	8	Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
KJV	Revelation	7	9	After this I beheld , and , lo , a great multitude , which no man could number , of all nations , and kindreds , and people , and tongues , stood before the throne , and before the Lamb , clothed with white robes , and palms in their hands ;
KJV	Revelation	7	10	And cried with a loud voice , saying , Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne , and unto the Lamb .
KJV	Revelation	7	11	And all the angels stood round about the throne , and about the elders and the four beasts , and fell before the throne on their faces , and worshipped God ,
KJV	Revelation	7	12	Saying , Amen : Blessing , and glory , and wisdom , and thanksgiving , and honour , and power , and might , be unto our God for ever and ever . Amen .
KJV	Revelation	7	13	And one of the elders answered , saying unto me , What are these which are arrayed in white robes ? and whence came they ?
KJV	Revelation	7	14	And I said unto him , Sir , thou knowest . And he said to me , These are they which came out of great tribulation , and have washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
KJV	Revelation	7	15	Therefore are they before the throne of God , and serve him day and night in his temple : and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them .
KJV	Revelation	7	16	They shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more ; neither shall the sun light on them , nor any heat .
KJV	Revelation	7	17	For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them , and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters : and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes .
KJV	Revelation	8	8	And the second angel sounded , and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea : and the third part of the sea became blood ;
KJV	Revelation	8	2	And I saw the seven angels which stood before God ; and to them were given seven trumpets .
KJV	Revelation	8	3	And another angel came and stood at the altar , having a golden censer ; and there was given unto him much incense , that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne .
KJV	Revelation	8	4	And the smoke of the incense , which came with the prayers of the saints , ascended up before God out of the angel 's hand .
KJV	Revelation	8	5	And the angel took the censer , and filled it with fire of the altar , and cast it into the earth : and there were voices , and thunderings , and lightnings , and an earthquake .
KJV	Revelation	8	6	And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound .
KJV	Revelation	8	7	The first angel sounded , and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood , and they were cast upon the earth : and the third part of trees was burnt up , and all green grass was burnt up .
KJV	Revelation	8	9	And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea , and had life , died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
KJV	Revelation	8	10	And the third angel sounded , and there fell a great star from heaven , burning as it were a lamp , and it fell upon the third part of the rivers , and upon the fountains of waters ;
KJV	Revelation	8	11	And the name of the star is called Wormwood : and the third part of the waters became wormwood ; and many men died of the waters , because they were made bitter .
KJV	Revelation	8	12	And the fourth angel sounded , and the third part of the sun was smitten , and the third part of the moon , and the third part of the stars ; so as the third part of them was darkened , and the day shone not for a third part of it , and the night likewise .
KJV	Revelation	8	13	And I beheld , and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven , saying with a loud voice , Woe , woe , woe , to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels , which are yet to sound !
KJV	Revelation	9	9	And they had breastplates , as it were breastplates of iron ; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle .
KJV	Revelation	9	2	And he opened the bottomless pit ; and there arose a smoke out of the pit , as the smoke of a great furnace ; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit .
KJV	Revelation	9	3	And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth : and unto them was given power , as the scorpions of the earth have power .
KJV	Revelation	9	4	And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads .
KJV	Revelation	9	5	And to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months : and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion , when he striketh a man .
KJV	Revelation	9	6	And in those days shall men seek death , and shall not find it ; and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them .
KJV	Revelation	9	7	And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle ; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
KJV	Revelation	9	8	And they had hair as the hair of women , and their teeth were as the teeth of lions .
KJV	Revelation	9	10	And they had tails like unto scorpions , and there were stings in their tails : and their power was to hurt men five months .
KJV	Revelation	9	11	And they had a king over them , which is the angel of the bottomless pit , whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon , but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon .
KJV	Revelation	9	12	One woe is past ; and , behold , there come two woes more hereafter .
KJV	Revelation	9	13	And the sixth angel sounded , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God ,
KJV	Revelation	9	14	Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet , Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates .
KJV	Revelation	9	15	And the four angels were loosed , which were prepared for an hour , and a day , and a month , and a year , for to slay the third part of men .
KJV	Revelation	9	16	And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand : and I heard the number of them .
KJV	Revelation	9	17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision , and them that sat on them , having breastplates of fire , and of jacinth , and brimstone : and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions ; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone .
KJV	Revelation	9	18	By these three was the third part of men killed , by the fire , and by the smoke , and by the brimstone , which issued out of their mouths .
KJV	Revelation	9	19	For their power is in their mouth , and in their tails : for their tails were like unto serpents , and had heads , and with them they do hurt .
KJV	Revelation	9	20	And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands , that they should not worship devils , and idols of gold , and silver , and brass , and stone , and of wood : which neither can see , nor hear , nor walk :
KJV	Revelation	9	21	Neither repented they of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their fornication , nor of their thefts .
KJV	Revelation	10	10	And I took the little book out of the angel 's hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey : and as soon as I had eaten it , my belly was bitter .
KJV	Revelation	10	2	And he had in his hand a little book open : and he set his right foot upon the sea , and his left foot on the earth ,
KJV	Revelation	10	3	And cried with a loud voice , as when a lion roareth : and when he had cried , seven thunders uttered their voices .
KJV	Revelation	10	4	And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices , I was about to write : and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered , and write them not .
KJV	Revelation	10	5	And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven ,
KJV	Revelation	10	6	And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever , who created heaven , and the things that therein are , and the earth , and the things that therein are , and the sea , and the things which are therein , that there should be time no longer :
KJV	Revelation	10	7	But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he shall begin to sound , the mystery of God should be finished , as he hath declared to his servants the prophets .
KJV	Revelation	10	8	And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again , and said , Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth .
KJV	Revelation	10	9	And I went unto the angel , and said unto him , Give me the little book . And he said unto me , Take it , and eat it up ; and it shall make thy belly bitter , but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey .
KJV	Revelation	10	11	And he said unto me , Thou must prophesy again before many peoples , and nations , and tongues , and kings .
KJV	Revelation	11	11	And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them , and they stood upon their feet ; and great fear fell upon them which saw them .
KJV	Revelation	11	2	But the court which is without the temple leave out , and measure it not ; for it is given unto the Gentiles : and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months .
KJV	Revelation	11	3	And I will give power unto my two witnesses , and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days , clothed in sackcloth .
KJV	Revelation	11	4	These are the two olive trees , and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth .
KJV	Revelation	11	5	And if any man will hurt them , fire proceedeth out of their mouth , and devoureth their enemies : and if any man will hurt them , he must in this manner be killed .
KJV	Revelation	11	6	These have power to shut heaven , that it rain not in the days of their prophecy : and have power over waters to turn them to blood , and to smite the earth with all plagues , as often as they will .
KJV	Revelation	11	7	And when they shall have finished their testimony , the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them .
KJV	Revelation	11	8	And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt , where also our Lord was crucified .
KJV	Revelation	11	9	And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half , and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves .
KJV	Revelation	11	10	And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them , and make merry , and shall send gifts one to another ; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth .
KJV	Revelation	11	12	And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them , Come up hither . And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud ; and their enemies beheld them .
KJV	Revelation	11	13	And the same hour was there a great earthquake , and the tenth part of the city fell , and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand : and the remnant were affrighted , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
KJV	Revelation	11	14	The second woe is past ; and , behold , the third woe cometh quickly .
KJV	Revelation	11	15	And the seventh angel sounded ; and there were great voices in heaven , saying , The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord , and of his Christ ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
KJV	Revelation	11	16	And the four and twenty elders , which sat before God on their seats , fell upon their faces , and worshipped God ,
KJV	Revelation	11	17	Saying , We give thee thanks , O Lord God Almighty , which art , and wast , and art to come ; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power , and hast reigned .
KJV	Revelation	11	18	And the nations were angry , and thy wrath is come , and the time of the dead , that they should be judged , and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets , and to the saints , and them that fear thy name , small and great ; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth .
KJV	Revelation	11	19	And the temple of God was opened in heaven , and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament : and there were lightnings , and voices , and thunderings , and an earthquake , and great hail .
KJV	Revelation	12	12	Therefore rejoice , ye heavens , and ye that dwell in them . Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea ! for the devil is come down unto you , having great wrath , because he knoweth that he hath but a short time .
KJV	Revelation	12	2	And she being with child cried , travailing in birth , and pained to be delivered .
KJV	Revelation	12	3	And there appeared another wonder in heaven ; and behold a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and seven crowns upon his heads .
KJV	Revelation	12	4	And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to devour her child as soon as it was born .
KJV	Revelation	12	5	And she brought forth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron : and her child was caught up unto God , and to his throne .
KJV	Revelation	12	6	And the woman fled into the wilderness , where she hath a place prepared of God , that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days .
KJV	Revelation	12	7	And there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels fought against the dragon ; and the dragon fought and his angels ,
KJV	Revelation	12	8	And prevailed not ; neither was their place found any more in heaven .
KJV	Revelation	12	9	And the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the Devil , and Satan , which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
KJV	Revelation	12	10	And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven , Now is come salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our God , and the power of his Christ : for the accuser of our brethren is cast down , which accused them before our God day and night .
KJV	Revelation	12	11	And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb , and by the word of their testimony ; and they loved not their lives unto the death .
KJV	Revelation	12	13	And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth , he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child .
KJV	Revelation	12	14	And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle , that she might fly into the wilderness , into her place , where she is nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent .
KJV	Revelation	12	15	And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood .
KJV	Revelation	12	16	And the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth .
KJV	Revelation	12	17	And the dragon was wroth with the woman , and went to make war with the remnant of her seed , which keep the commandments of God , and have the testimony of Jesus Christ .
KJV	Revelation	13	13	And he doeth great wonders , so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men ,
KJV	Revelation	13	2	And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his mouth as the mouth of a lion : and the dragon gave him his power , and his seat , and great authority .
KJV	Revelation	13	3	And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death ; and his deadly wound was healed : and all the world wondered after the beast .
KJV	Revelation	13	4	And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast : and they worshipped the beast , saying , Who is like unto the beast ? who is able to make war with him ?
KJV	Revelation	13	5	And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies ; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months .
KJV	Revelation	13	6	And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God , to blaspheme his name , and his tabernacle , and them that dwell in heaven .
KJV	Revelation	13	7	And it was given unto him to make war with the saints , and to overcome them : and power was given him over all kindreds , and tongues , and nations .
KJV	Revelation	13	8	And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him , whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world .
KJV	Revelation	13	9	If any man have an ear , let him hear .
KJV	Revelation	13	10	He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity : he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword . Here is the patience and the faith of the saints .
KJV	Revelation	13	11	And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth ; and he had two horns like a lamb , and he spake as a dragon .
KJV	Revelation	13	12	And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him , and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed .
KJV	Revelation	13	14	And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast ; saying to them that dwell on the earth , that they should make an image to the beast , which had the wound by a sword , and did live .
KJV	Revelation	13	15	And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed .
KJV	Revelation	13	16	And he causeth all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and bond , to receive a mark in their right hand , or in their foreheads :
KJV	Revelation	13	17	And that no man might buy or sell , save he that had the mark , or the name of the beast , or the number of his name .
KJV	Revelation	13	18	Here is wisdom . Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast : for it is the number of a man ; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six .
KJV	Revelation	14	14	And I looked , and behold a white cloud , and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle .
KJV	Revelation	14	2	And I heard a voice from heaven , as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of a great thunder : and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps :
KJV	Revelation	14	3	And they sung as it were a new song before the throne , and before the four beasts , and the elders : and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand , which were redeemed from the earth .
KJV	Revelation	14	4	These are they which were not defiled with women ; for they are virgins . These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth . These were redeemed from among men , being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb .
KJV	Revelation	14	5	And in their mouth was found no guile : for they are without fault before the throne of God .
KJV	Revelation	14	6	And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven , having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth , and to every nation , and kindred , and tongue , and people ,
KJV	Revelation	14	7	Saying with a loud voice , Fear God , and give glory to him ; for the hour of his judgment is come : and worship him that made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and the fountains of waters .
KJV	Revelation	14	8	And there followed another angel , saying , Babylon is fallen , is fallen , that great city , because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication .
KJV	Revelation	14	9	And the third angel followed them , saying with a loud voice , If any man worship the beast and his image , and receive his mark in his forehead , or in his hand ,
KJV	Revelation	14	10	The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God , which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation ; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels , and in the presence of the Lamb :
KJV	Revelation	14	11	And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever : and they have no rest day nor night , who worship the beast and his image , and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name .
KJV	Revelation	14	12	Here is the patience of the saints : here are they that keep the commandments of God , and the faith of Jesus .
KJV	Revelation	14	13	And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Write , Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth : Yea , saith the Spirit , that they may rest from their labours ; and their works do follow them .
KJV	Revelation	14	15	And another angel came out of the temple , crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud , Thrust in thy sickle , and reap : for the time is come for thee to reap ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe .
KJV	Revelation	14	16	And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth ; and the earth was reaped .
KJV	Revelation	14	17	And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven , he also having a sharp sickle .
KJV	Revelation	14	18	And another angel came out from the altar , which had power over fire ; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle , saying , Thrust in thy sharp sickle , and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth ; for her grapes are fully ripe .
KJV	Revelation	14	19	And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth , and gathered the vine of the earth , and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God .
KJV	Revelation	14	20	And the winepress was trodden without the city , and blood came out of the winepress , even unto the horse bridles , by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs .
KJV	Revelation	15	15	And I saw another sign in heaven , great and marvellous , seven angels having the seven last plagues ; for in them is filled up the wrath of God .
KJV	Revelation	15	2	And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire : and them that had gotten the victory over the beast , and over his image , and over his mark , and over the number of his name , stand on the sea of glass , having the harps of God .
KJV	Revelation	15	3	And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , Great and marvellous are thy works , Lord God Almighty ; just and true are thy ways , thou King of saints .
KJV	Revelation	15	4	Who shall not fear thee , O Lord , and glorify thy name ? for thou only art holy : for all nations shall come and worship before thee ; for thy judgments are made manifest .
KJV	Revelation	15	5	And after that I looked , and , behold , the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened :
KJV	Revelation	15	6	And the seven angels came out of the temple , having the seven plagues , clothed in pure and white linen , and having their breasts girded with golden girdles .
KJV	Revelation	15	7	And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God , who liveth for ever and ever .
KJV	Revelation	15	8	And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temple , till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled .
KJV	Revelation	16	16	And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon .
KJV	Revelation	16	2	And the first went , and poured out his vial upon the earth ; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast , and upon them which worshipped his image .
KJV	Revelation	16	3	And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea ; and it became as the blood of a dead man : and every living soul died in the sea .
KJV	Revelation	16	4	And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters ; and they became blood .
KJV	Revelation	16	5	And I heard the angel of the waters say , Thou art righteous , O Lord , which art , and wast , and shalt be , because thou hast judged thus .
KJV	Revelation	16	6	For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets , and thou hast given them blood to drink ; for they are worthy .
KJV	Revelation	16	7	And I heard another out of the altar say , Even so , Lord God Almighty , true and righteous are thy judgments .
KJV	Revelation	16	8	And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun ; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire .
KJV	Revelation	16	9	And men were scorched with great heat , and blasphemed the name of God , which hath power over these plagues : and they repented not to give him glory .
KJV	Revelation	16	10	And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast ; and his kingdom was full of darkness ; and they gnawed their tongues for pain ,
KJV	Revelation	16	11	And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores , and repented not of their deeds .
KJV	Revelation	16	12	And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates ; and the water thereof was dried up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
KJV	Revelation	16	13	And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
KJV	Revelation	16	14	For they are the spirits of devils , working miracles , which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty .
KJV	Revelation	16	15	Behold , I come as a thief . Blessed is he that watcheth , and keepeth his garments , lest he walk naked , and they see his shame .
KJV	Revelation	16	17	And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air ; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven , from the throne , saying , It is done .
KJV	Revelation	16	18	And there were voices , and thunders , and lightnings ; and there was a great earthquake , such as was not since men were upon the earth , so mighty an earthquake , and so great .
KJV	Revelation	16	19	And the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell : and great Babylon came in remembrance before God , to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath .
KJV	Revelation	16	20	And every island fled away , and the mountains were not found .
KJV	Revelation	16	21	And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven , every stone about the weight of a talent : and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail ; for the plague thereof was exceeding great .
KJV	Revelation	17	17	For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will , and to agree , and give their kingdom unto the beast , until the words of God shall be fulfilled .
KJV	Revelation	17	2	With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication , and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication .
KJV	Revelation	17	3	So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness : and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast , full of names of blasphemy , having seven heads and ten horns .
KJV	Revelation	17	4	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls , having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication :
KJV	Revelation	17	5	And upon her forehead was a name written , Mystery , Babylon The Great , The Mother Of Harlots And Abominations Of The Earth .
KJV	Revelation	17	6	And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus : and when I saw her , I wondered with great admiration .
KJV	Revelation	17	7	And the angel said unto me , Wherefore didst thou marvel ? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carrieth her , which hath the seven heads and ten horns .
KJV	Revelation	17	8	The beast that thou sawest was , and is not ; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit , and go into perdition : and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder , whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world , when they behold the beast that was , and is not , and yet is .
KJV	Revelation	17	9	And here is the mind which hath wisdom . The seven heads are seven mountains , on which the woman sitteth .
KJV	Revelation	17	10	And there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come ; and when he cometh , he must continue a short space .
KJV	Revelation	17	11	And the beast that was , and is not , even he is the eighth , and is of the seven , and goeth into perdition .
KJV	Revelation	17	12	And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings , which have received no kingdom as yet ; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast .
KJV	Revelation	17	13	These have one mind , and shall give their power and strength unto the beast .
KJV	Revelation	17	14	These shall make war with the Lamb , and the Lamb shall overcome them : for he is Lord of lords , and King of kings : and they that are with him are called , and chosen , and faithful .
KJV	Revelation	17	15	And he saith unto me , The waters which thou sawest , where the whore sitteth , are peoples , and multitudes , and nations , and tongues .
KJV	Revelation	17	16	And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast , these shall hate the whore , and shall make her desolate and naked , and shall eat her flesh , and burn her with fire .
KJV	Revelation	17	18	And the woman which thou sawest is that great city , which reigneth over the kings of the earth .
KJV	Revelation	18	18	And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning , saying , What city is like unto this great city !
KJV	Revelation	18	2	And he cried mightily with a strong voice , saying , Babylon the great is fallen , is fallen , and is become the habitation of devils , and the hold of every foul spirit , and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird .
KJV	Revelation	18	3	For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication , and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her , and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies .
KJV	Revelation	18	4	And I heard another voice from heaven , saying , Come out of her , my people , that ye be not partakers of her sins , and that ye receive not of her plagues .
KJV	Revelation	18	5	For her sins have reached unto heaven , and God hath remembered her iniquities .
KJV	Revelation	18	6	Reward her even as she rewarded you , and double unto her double according to her works : in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double .
KJV	Revelation	18	7	How much she hath glorified herself , and lived deliciously , so much torment and sorrow give her : for she saith in her heart , I sit a queen , and am no widow , and shall see no sorrow .
KJV	Revelation	18	8	Therefore shall her plagues come in one day , death , and mourning , and famine ; and she shall be utterly burned with fire : for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her .
KJV	Revelation	18	9	And the kings of the earth , who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her , shall bewail her , and lament for her , when they shall see the smoke of her burning ,
KJV	Revelation	18	10	Standing afar off for the fear of her torment , saying , Alas , alas that great city Babylon , that mighty city ! for in one hour is thy judgment come .
KJV	Revelation	18	11	And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her ; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more :
KJV	Revelation	18	12	The merchandise of gold , and silver , and precious stones , and of pearls , and fine linen , and purple , and silk , and scarlet , and all thyine wood , and all manner vessels of ivory , and all manner vessels of most precious wood , and of brass , and iron , and marble ,
KJV	Revelation	18	13	And cinnamon , and odours , and ointments , and frankincense , and wine , and oil , and fine flour , and wheat , and beasts , and sheep , and horses , and chariots , and slaves , and souls of men .
KJV	Revelation	18	14	And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee , and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee , and thou shalt find them no more at all .
KJV	Revelation	18	15	The merchants of these things , which were made rich by her , shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment , weeping and wailing ,
KJV	Revelation	18	16	And saying , Alas , alas that great city , that was clothed in fine linen , and purple , and scarlet , and decked with gold , and precious stones , and pearls !
KJV	Revelation	18	17	For in one hour so great riches is come to nought . And every shipmaster , and all the company in ships , and sailors , and as many as trade by sea , stood afar off ,
KJV	Revelation	18	19	And they cast dust on their heads , and cried , weeping and wailing , saying , Alas , alas that great city , wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness ! for in one hour is she made desolate .
KJV	Revelation	18	20	Rejoice over her , thou heaven , and ye holy apostles and prophets ; for God hath avenged you on her .
KJV	Revelation	18	21	And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone , and cast it into the sea , saying , Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .
KJV	Revelation	18	22	And the voice of harpers , and musicians , and of pipers , and trumpeters , shall be heard no more at all in thee ; and no craftsman , of whatsoever craft he be , shall be found any more in thee ; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee ;
KJV	Revelation	18	23	And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee ; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee : for thy merchants were the great men of the earth ; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived .
KJV	Revelation	18	24	And in her was found the blood of prophets , and of saints , and of all that were slain upon the earth .
KJV	Revelation	19	19	And I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse , and against his army .
KJV	Revelation	19	2	For true and righteous are his judgments : for he hath judged the great whore , which did corrupt the earth with her fornication , and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand .
KJV	Revelation	19	3	And again they said , Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever and ever .
KJV	Revelation	19	4	And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne , saying , Amen ; Alleluia .
KJV	Revelation	19	5	And a voice came out of the throne , saying , Praise our God , all ye his servants , and ye that fear him , both small and great .
KJV	Revelation	19	6	And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude , and as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of mighty thunderings , saying , Alleluia : for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth .
KJV	Revelation	19	7	Let us be glad and rejoice , and give honour to him : for the marriage of the Lamb is come , and his wife hath made herself ready .
KJV	Revelation	19	8	And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen , clean and white : for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints .
KJV	Revelation	19	9	And he saith unto me , Write , Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb . And he saith unto me , These are the true sayings of God .
KJV	Revelation	19	10	And I fell at his feet to worship him . And he said unto me , See thou do it not : I am thy fellowservant , and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus : worship God : for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy .
KJV	Revelation	19	11	And I saw heaven opened , and behold a white horse ; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True , and in righteousness he doth judge and make war .
KJV	Revelation	19	12	His eyes were as a flame of fire , and on his head were many crowns ; and he had a name written , that no man knew , but he himself .
KJV	Revelation	19	13	And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood : and his name is called The Word of God .
KJV	Revelation	19	14	And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses , clothed in fine linen , white and clean .
KJV	Revelation	19	15	And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword , that with it he should smite the nations : and he shall rule them with a rod of iron : and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God .
KJV	Revelation	19	16	And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written , King Of Kings , And Lord Of Lords .
KJV	Revelation	19	17	And I saw an angel standing in the sun ; and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven , Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God ;
KJV	Revelation	19	18	That ye may eat the flesh of kings , and the flesh of captains , and the flesh of mighty men , and the flesh of horses , and of them that sit on them , and the flesh of all men , both free and bond , both small and great .
KJV	Revelation	19	20	And the beast was taken , and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him , with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast , and them that worshipped his image . These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone .
KJV	Revelation	19	21	And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse , which sword proceeded out of his mouth : and all the fowls were filled with their flesh .
KJV	Revelation	20	20	And I saw an angel come down from heaven , having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand .
KJV	Revelation	20	2	And he laid hold on the dragon , that old serpent , which is the Devil , and Satan , and bound him a thousand years ,
KJV	Revelation	20	3	And cast him into the bottomless pit , and shut him up , and set a seal upon him , that he should deceive the nations no more , till the thousand years should be fulfilled : and after that he must be loosed a little season .
KJV	Revelation	20	4	And I saw thrones , and they sat upon them , and judgment was given unto them : and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus , and for the word of God , and which had not worshipped the beast , neither his image , neither had received his mark upon their foreheads , or in their hands ; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years .
KJV	Revelation	20	5	But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished . This is the first resurrection .
KJV	Revelation	20	6	Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection : on such the second death hath no power , but they shall be priests of God and of Christ , and shall reign with him a thousand years .
KJV	Revelation	20	7	And when the thousand years are expired , Satan shall be loosed out of his prison ,
KJV	Revelation	20	8	And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth , Gog , and Magog , to gather them together to battle : the number of whom is as the sand of the sea .
KJV	Revelation	20	9	And they went up on the breadth of the earth , and compassed the camp of the saints about , and the beloved city : and fire came down from God out of heaven , and devoured them .
KJV	Revelation	20	10	And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone , where the beast and the false prophet are , and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever .
KJV	Revelation	20	11	And I saw a great white throne , and him that sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away ; and there was found no place for them .
KJV	Revelation	20	12	And I saw the dead , small and great , stand before God ; and the books were opened : and another book was opened , which is the book of life : and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books , according to their works .
KJV	Revelation	20	13	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it ; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them : and they were judged every man according to their works .
KJV	Revelation	20	14	And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire . This is the second death .
KJV	Revelation	20	15	And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire .
KJV	Revelation	21	21	And the twelve gates were twelve pearls : every several gate was of one pearl : and the street of the city was pure gold , as it were transparent glass .
KJV	Revelation	21	2	And I John saw the holy city , new Jerusalem , coming down from God out of heaven , prepared as a bride adorned for her husband .
KJV	Revelation	21	3	And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying , Behold , the tabernacle of God is with men , and he will dwell with them , and they shall be his people , and God himself shall be with them , and be their God .
KJV	Revelation	21	4	And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes ; and there shall be no more death , neither sorrow , nor crying , neither shall there be any more pain : for the former things are passed away .
KJV	Revelation	21	5	And he that sat upon the throne said , Behold , I make all things new . And he said unto me , Write : for these words are true and faithful .
KJV	Revelation	21	6	And he said unto me , It is done . I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end . I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely .
KJV	Revelation	21	7	He that overcometh shall inherit all things ; and I will be his God , and he shall be my son .
KJV	Revelation	21	8	But the fearful , and unbelieving , and the abominable , and murderers , and whoremongers , and sorcerers , and idolaters , and all liars , shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone : which is the second death .
KJV	Revelation	21	9	And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues , and talked with me , saying , Come hither , I will shew thee the bride , the Lamb 's wife .
KJV	Revelation	21	10	And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain , and shewed me that great city , the holy Jerusalem , descending out of heaven from God ,
KJV	Revelation	21	11	Having the glory of God : and her light was like unto a stone most precious , even like a jasper stone , clear as crystal ;
KJV	Revelation	21	12	And had a wall great and high , and had twelve gates , and at the gates twelve angels , and names written thereon , which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel :
KJV	Revelation	21	13	On the east three gates ; on the north three gates ; on the south three gates ; and on the west three gates .
KJV	Revelation	21	14	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations , and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb .
KJV	Revelation	21	15	And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city , and the gates thereof , and the wall thereof .
KJV	Revelation	21	16	And the city lieth foursquare , and the length is as large as the breadth : and he measured the city with the reed , twelve thousand furlongs . The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal .
KJV	Revelation	21	17	And he measured the wall thereof , an hundred and forty and four cubits , according to the measure of a man , that is , of the angel .
KJV	Revelation	21	18	And the building of the wall of it was of jasper : and the city was pure gold , like unto clear glass .
KJV	Revelation	21	19	And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones . The first foundation was jasper ; the second , sapphire ; the third , a chalcedony ; the fourth , an emerald ;
KJV	Revelation	21	20	The fifth , sardonyx ; the sixth , sardius ; the seventh , chrysolyte ; the eighth , beryl ; the ninth , a topaz ; the tenth , a chrysoprasus ; the eleventh , a jacinth ; the twelfth , an amethyst .
KJV	Revelation	21	22	And I saw no temple therein : for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it .
KJV	Revelation	21	23	And the city had no need of the sun , neither of the moon , to shine in it : for the glory of God did lighten it , and the Lamb is the light thereof .
KJV	Revelation	21	24	And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it : and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it .
KJV	Revelation	21	25	And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day : for there shall be no night there .
KJV	Revelation	21	26	And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it .
KJV	Revelation	21	27	And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth , neither whatsoever worketh abomination , or maketh a lie : but they which are written in the Lamb 's book of life .
KJV	Revelation	22	22	And he shewed me a pure river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb .
KJV	Revelation	22	2	In the midst of the street of it , and on either side of the river , was there the tree of life , which bare twelve manner of fruits , and yielded her fruit every month : and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
KJV	Revelation	22	3	And there shall be no more curse : but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it ; and his servants shall serve him :
KJV	Revelation	22	4	And they shall see his face ; and his name shall be in their foreheads .
KJV	Revelation	22	5	And there shall be no night there ; and they need no candle , neither light of the sun ; for the Lord God giveth them light : and they shall reign for ever and ever .
KJV	Revelation	22	6	And he said unto me , These sayings are faithful and true : and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done .
KJV	Revelation	22	7	Behold , I come quickly : blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book .
KJV	Revelation	22	8	And I John saw these things , and heard them . And when I had heard and seen , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things .
KJV	Revelation	22	9	Then saith he unto me , See thou do it not : for I am thy fellowservant , and of thy brethren the prophets , and of them which keep the sayings of this book : worship God .
KJV	Revelation	22	10	And he saith unto me , Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book : for the time is at hand .
KJV	Revelation	22	11	He that is unjust , let him be unjust still : and he which is filthy , let him be filthy still : and he that is righteous , let him be righteous still : and he that is holy , let him be holy still .
KJV	Revelation	22	12	And , behold , I come quickly ; and my reward is with me , to give every man according as his work shall be .
KJV	Revelation	22	13	I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end , the first and the last .
KJV	Revelation	22	14	Blessed are they that do his commandments , that they may have right to the tree of life , and may enter in through the gates into the city .
KJV	Revelation	22	15	For without are dogs , and sorcerers , and whoremongers , and murderers , and idolaters , and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie .
KJV	Revelation	22	16	I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches . I am the root and the offspring of David , and the bright and morning star .
KJV	Revelation	22	17	And the Spirit and the bride say , Come . And let him that heareth say , Come . And let him that is athirst come . And whosoever will , let him take the water of life freely .
KJV	Revelation	22	18	For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book , If any man shall add unto these things , God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book :
KJV	Revelation	22	19	And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy , God shall take away his part out of the book of life , and out of the holy city , and from the things which are written in this book .
KJV	Revelation	22	20	He which testifieth these things saith , Surely I come quickly . Amen . Even so , come , Lord Jesus .
KJV	Revelation	22	21	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all . Amen .
