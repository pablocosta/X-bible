NABRE	Matthew	1	1	Chr 3:11–12 ) , so that there are fourteen generations in that section . Yet the third ( Mt 1:12–16 ) apparently has only thirteen . Since Matthew here emphasizes that each section has fourteen , it is unlikely that the thirteen of the last was due to his oversight . Some scholars suggest that Jesus who is called the Messiah ( Mt 1:16b ) doubles the final member of the chain : Jesus , born within the family of David , opens up the new age as Messiah , so that in fact there are fourteen generations in the third section . This is perhaps too subtle , and the hypothesis of a slip not on the part of Matthew but of a later scribe seems likely . On Messiah , see note on Lk 2:11 . - 1:18–25 This first story of the infancy narrative spells out what is summarily indicated in Mt 1:16 . The virginal conception of Jesus is the work of the Spirit of God . Joseph ’ s decision to divorce Mary is overcome by the heavenly command that he take her into his home and accept the child as his own . The natural genealogical line is broken but the promises to David are fulfilled ; through Joseph ’ s adoption the child belongs to the family of David . Matthew sees the virginal conception as the fulfillment of Is 7:14 . - 1:18 Betrothed to Joseph : betrothal was the first part of the marriage , constituting a man and woman as husband and wife . Subsequent infidelity was considered adultery . The betrothal was followed some months later by the husband ’ s taking his wife into his home , at which time normal married life began . - 1:19 A righteous man : as a devout observer of the Mosaic law , Joseph wished to break his union with someone whom he suspected of gross violation of the law . It is commonly said that the law required him to do so , but the texts usually given in support of that view , e.g. , Dt 22:20–21 do not clearly pertain to Joseph ’ s situation . Unwilling to expose her to shame : the penalty for proved adultery was death by stoning ; cf . Dt 22:21–23 . - 1:20 The angel of the Lord : in the Old Testament a common designation of God in communication with a human being . In a dream : see Mt 2:13 ,

NABRE	Matthew	1	11	Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the Babylonian exile .
NABRE	Matthew	1	12	( I ) After the Babylonian exile , Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel , Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel ,
NABRE	Matthew	1	13	Zerubbabel the father of Abiud . Abiud became the father of Eliakim , Eliakim the father of Azor ,

NABRE	Matthew	1	16	Jacob the father of Joseph , the husband of Mary . Of her was born Jesus who is called the Messiah .
NABRE	Matthew	1	17	Thus the total number of generations from Abraham to David is fourteen generations ; from David to the Babylonian exile , fourteen generations ; from the Babylonian exile to the Messiah , fourteen generations . [ e ] The Birth of Jesus . [ f ]

A closer parallel is the dream of Amram , father of Moses , related by Josephus ( Antiquities 2:212 , 215–16 ) . - 1:21 Jesus : in first-century Judaism the Hebrew name Joshua ( Greek Iēsous ) meaning “ Yahweh helps ” was interpreted as “ Yahweh saves. ” - 1:23 God is with us : God ’ s promise of deliverance to Judah in Isaiah ’ s time is seen by Matthew as fulfilled in the birth of Jesus , in whom God is with his people . The name Emmanuel is alluded to at the end of the gospel where the risen Jesus assures his disciples of his continued presence , “ …I am with you always , until the end of the age ” ( Mt 28:20 ) . - 1:25 Until she bore a son : the evangelist is concerned to emphasize that Joseph was not responsible for the conception of Jesus . The Greek word translated “ until ” does not imply normal marital conduct after Jesus ’ birth , nor does it exclude it .

NABRE	Matthew	1	20	( J ) Such was his intention when , behold , the angel of the Lord [ i ] appeared to him in a dream and said , “ Joseph , son of David , do not be afraid to take Mary your wife into your home . For it is through the holy Spirit that this child has been conceived in her .
NABRE	Matthew	1	21	She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus , [ j ] because he will save his people from their sins. ”
NABRE	Matthew	1	22	. These dreams may be meant to recall the dreams of Joseph , son of Jacob the patriarch ( Gn 37:5–11 ,
NABRE	Matthew	1	24	When Joseph awoke , he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife into his home .
NABRE	Matthew	1	25	He had no relations with her until she bore a son , [ l ] and he named him Jesus . ( L ) Footnotes - 1:1–2:23 The infancy narrative forms the prologue of the gospel . Consisting of a genealogy and five stories , it presents the coming of Jesus as the climax of Israel ’ s history , and the events of his conception , birth , and early childhood as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy . The genealogy is probably traditional material that Matthew edited . In its first two sections ( Mt 1:2–11 ) it was drawn from Ru 4:18–22 ;

NABRE	Matthew	2	1	Kgs 11:40 ; Jer 26:21 ) , but the main reason why the child is to be taken to Egypt is that he may relive the Exodus experience of Israel . - 2:15 The fulfillment citation is taken from Hos 11:1 . Israel , God ’ s son , was called out of Egypt at the time of the Exodus ; Jesus , the Son of God , will similarly be called out of that land in a new exodus . The father-son relationship between God and the nation is set in a higher key . Here the son is not a group adopted as “ son of God , ” but the child who , as conceived by the holy Spirit , stands in unique relation to God . He is son of David and of Abraham , of Mary and of Joseph , but , above all , of God . - 2:18 Jer 31:15 portrays Rachel , wife of the patriarch Jacob , weeping for her children taken into exile at the time of the Assyrian invasion of the northern kingdom ( 722–21 B.C. ) . Bethlehem was traditionally identified with Ephrath , the place near which Rachel was buried ( see Gn 35:19 ; 48:7 ) , and the mourning of Rachel is here applied to her lost children of a later age . Ramah : about six miles north of Jerusalem . The lamentation of Rachel is so great as to be heard at a far distance . - 2:20 For those who sought the child ’ s life are dead : Moses , who had fled from Egypt because the Pharaoh sought to kill him ( see Ex 2:15 ) , was told to return there , “ for all the men who sought your life are dead ” ( Ex 4:19 ) . - 2:22 With the agreement of the emperor Augustus , Archelaus received half of his father ’ s kingdom , including Judea , after Herod ’ s death .

NABRE	Matthew	2	5	( B ) They said to him , “ In Bethlehem of Judea , for thus it has been written through the prophet :
NABRE	Matthew	2	6	. - 2:23 Nazareth…he shall be called a Nazorean : the tradition of Jesus ’ residence in Nazareth was firmly established , and Matthew sees it as being in accordance with the foreannounced plan of God . The town of Nazareth is not mentioned in the Old Testament , and no such prophecy can be found there . The vague expression “ through the prophets ” may be due to Matthew ’ s seeing a connection between Nazareth and certain texts in which there are words with a remote similarity to the name of that town . Some such Old Testament texts are Is 11:1 where the Davidic king of the future is called “ a bud ” ( nēser ) that shall blossom from the roots of Jesse , and Jgs 13:5 ,

NABRE	Matthew	2	14	Joseph rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt .
NABRE	Matthew	2	15	; Is 60:6 . These Old Testament texts led to the interpretation of the magi as kings . - 2:13–23 Biblical and nonbiblical traditions about Moses are here applied to the child Jesus , though the dominant Old Testament type is not Moses but Israel ( Mt 2:15 ) . - 2:13 Flee to Egypt : Egypt was a traditional place of refuge for those fleeing from danger in Palestine ( see
NABRE	Matthew	2	16	When Herod realized that he had been deceived by the magi , he became furious . He ordered the massacre of all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity two years old and under , in accordance with the time he had ascertained from the magi .
NABRE	Matthew	2	17	Then was fulfilled what had been said through Jeremiah the prophet :
NABRE	Matthew	2	18	[ i ] ( E ) “ A voice was heard in Ramah , sobbing and loud lamentation ; Rachel weeping for her children , and she would not be consoled , since they were no more. ” The Return from Egypt .

The expectation of the return of Elijah from heaven to prepare Israel for the final manifestation of God ’ s kingdom was widespread , and according to Matthew this expectation was fulfilled in the Baptist ’ s ministry ( Mt 11:14 ; 17:11–13 ) . - 3:6 Ritual washing was practiced by various groups in Palestine between

NABRE	Matthew	3	15	) . The threatening words that follow are addressed to them rather than to “ the crowds ” as in Lk 3:7 . The coming wrath : the judgment that will bring about the destruction of unrepentant sinners . - 3:11 Baptize you with the holy Spirit and fire : the water baptism of John will be followed by an “ immersion ” of the repentant in the cleansing power of the Spirit of God , and of the unrepentant in the destroying power of God ’ s judgment . However , some see the holy Spirit and fire as synonymous , and the effect of this “ baptism ” as either purification or destruction . See note on Lk 3:16 . - 3:12 The discrimination between the good and the bad is compared to the procedure by which a farmer separates wheat and chaff . The winnowing fan was a forklike shovel with which the threshed wheat was thrown into the air . The kernels fell to the ground ; the light chaff , blown off by the wind , was gathered and burned up . - 3:13–17 The baptism of Jesus is the occasion on which he is equipped for his ministry by the holy Spirit and proclaimed to be the Son of God . - 3:14–15 This dialogue , peculiar to Matthew , reveals John ’ s awareness of Jesus ’ superiority to him as the mightier one who is coming and who will baptize with the holy Spirit ( Mt 3:11 ) . His reluctance to admit Jesus among the sinners whom he is baptizing with water is overcome by Jesus ’ response . To fulfill all righteousness : in this gospel to fulfill usually refers to fulfillment of prophecy , and righteousness to moral conduct in conformity with God ’ s will . Here , however , as in Mt 5:6 ; 6:33 , righteousness seems to mean the saving activity of God . To fulfill all righteousness is to submit to the plan of God for the salvation of the human race . This involves Jesus ’ identification with sinners ; hence the propriety of his accepting John ’ s baptism . - 3:16 The Spirit…coming upon him : cf . Is 42:1 . - 3:17 This is my beloved Son : the Marcan address to Jesus ( Mk 1:11 ) is changed into a proclamation . The Father ’ s voice speaks in terms that reflect Is 42:1 ; Ps 2:7 ; Gn 22:2 .

The desert of Judea : the barren region west of the Dead Sea extending up the Jordan valley . - 3:2 Repent : the Baptist calls for a change of heart and conduct , a turning of one ’ s life from rebellion to obedience towards God . The kingdom of heaven is at hand : “ heaven ” ( lit. , “ the heavens ” ) is a substitute for the name “ God ” that was avoided by devout Jews of the time out of reverence . The expression “ the kingdom of heaven ” occurs only in the gospel of Matthew . It means the effective rule of God over his people . In its fullness it includes not only human obedience to God ’ s word , but the triumph of God over physical evils , supremely over death . In the expectation found in Jewish apocalyptic , the kingdom was to be ushered in by a judgment in which sinners would be condemned and perish , an expectation shared by the Baptist . This was modified in Christian understanding where the kingdom was seen as being established in stages , culminating with the parousia of Jesus . - 3:3 See note on Jn 1:23 . - 3:4 The clothing of John recalls the austere dress of the prophet Elijah (

John ’ s baptism may have been related to the purificatory washings of the Essenes at Qumran . - 3:7 Pharisees and Sadducees : the former were marked by devotion to the law , written and oral , and the scribes , experts in the law , belonged predominantly to this group . The Sadducees were the priestly aristocratic party , centered in Jerusalem . They accepted as scripture only the first five books of the Old Testament , followed only the letter of the law , rejected the oral legal traditions , and were opposed to teachings not found in the Pentateuch , such as the resurrection of the dead .

NABRE	Matthew	4	4	[ c ] He said in reply , “ It is written : ( C ) ‘ One does not live by bread alone , but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God. ’ ”
NABRE	Matthew	4	1	[ a ] ( A ) Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil .
NABRE	Matthew	4	2	( B ) He fasted for forty days and forty nights , [ b ] and afterwards he was hungry .
NABRE	Matthew	4	3	The tempter approached and said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , command that these stones become loaves of bread. ”
NABRE	Matthew	4	5	[ d ] Then the devil took him to the holy city , and made him stand on the parapet of the temple ,
NABRE	Matthew	4	6	and said to him , “ If you are the Son of God , throw yourself down . For it is written : ‘ He will command his angels concerning you ’ and ‘ with their hands they will support you , lest you dash your foot against a stone. ’ ” ( D )
NABRE	Matthew	4	7	Jesus answered him , “ Again it is written , ‘ You shall not put the Lord , your God , to the test. ’ ” ( E )
NABRE	Matthew	4	8	Then the devil took him up to a very high mountain , and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in their magnificence ,
NABRE	Matthew	4	9	and he said to him , “ All these I shall give to you , if you will prostrate yourself and worship me. ” [ e ]

NABRE	Matthew	4	12	. Unlike Israel ( Dt 6:16 ) , Jesus refuses to “ test ” God by demanding from him an extraordinary show of power . - 4:9 The worship of Satan to which Jesus is tempted is probably intended to recall Israel ’ s worship of false gods . His refusal is expressed in the words of Dt 6:13 . - 4:12–17 Isaiah ’ s prophecy of the light rising upon Zebulun and Naphtali ( Is 8:22–9:1 ) is fulfilled in Jesus ’ residence at Capernaum . The territory of these two tribes was the first to be devastated ( 733–32 B.C . ) at the time of the Assyrian invasion . In order to accommodate Jesus ’ move to Capernaum to the prophecy , Matthew speaks of that town as being “ in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali ” ( Mt 4:13 ) , whereas it was only in the territory of the latter , and he understands the sea of the prophecy , the Mediterranean , as the sea of Galilee . - 4:17 At the beginning of his preaching Jesus takes up the words of John the Baptist ( Mt 3:2 ) although with a different meaning ; in his ministry the kingdom of heaven has already begun to be present ( Mt 12:28 ) . - 4:18–22 The call of the first disciples promises them a share in Jesus ’ work and entails abandonment of family and former way of life . Three of the four , Simon , James , and John , are distinguished among the disciples by a closer relation with Jesus ( Mt 17:1 ; 26:37 ) . - 4:20 Here and in Mt 4:22 , as in Mark ( Mk 1:16–20 ) and unlike the Lucan account ( Lk 5:1–11 ) , the disciples ’ response is motivated only by Jesus ’ invitation , an element that emphasizes his mysterious power . - 4:23–25 This summary of Jesus ’ ministry concludes the narrative part of the first book of Matthew ’ s gospel ( Mt 3–4 ) . The activities of his ministry are teaching , proclaiming the gospel , and healing ; cf . Mt 9:35 . - 4:23 Their synagogues : Matthew usually designates the Jewish synagogues as their synagogue ( s ) ( Mt 9:35 ; 10:17 ; 12:9 ; 13:54 ) or , in address to Jews , your synagogues ( Mt 23:34 ) , an indication that he wrote after the break between church and synagogue . - 4:24 Syria : the Roman province to which Palestine belonged . - 4:25 The Decapolis : a federation of Greek cities in Palestine , originally ten in number , all but one east of the Jordan .

The testings of Jesus resemble those of Israel during the wandering in the desert and later in Canaan , and the victory of Jesus , the true Israel and the true Son , contrasts with the failure of the ancient and disobedient “ son , ” the old Israel . In the temptation account Matthew is almost identical with Luke ; both seem to have drawn upon the same source . - 4:2 Forty days and forty nights : the same time as that during which Moses remained on Sinai ( Ex 24:18 ) . The time reference , however , seems primarily intended to recall the forty years during which Israel was tempted in the desert ( Dt 8:2 ) . - 4:4 Cf . Dt 8:3 . Jesus refuses to use his power for his own benefit and accepts whatever God wills . - 4:5–7 The devil supports his proposal by an appeal to the scriptures , Ps 91:11a ,

Footnotes - 4:1–11 Jesus , proclaimed Son of God at his baptism , is subjected to a triple temptation . Obedience to the Father is a characteristic of true sonship , and Jesus is tempted by the devil to rebel against God , overtly in the third case , more subtly in the first two . Each refusal of Jesus is expressed in language taken from the Book of Deuteronomy ( Dt 8:3 ; 6:13 ,

NABRE	Matthew	5	5	[ f ] Blessed are the meek , ( C ) for they will inherit the land .
NABRE	Matthew	5	1	Cor 7:10 , 11b ) , and most scholars agree that they represent the stand of Jesus . Matthew ’ s “ exceptive clauses ” are understood by some as a modification of the absolute prohibition . It seems , however , that the unlawfulness that Matthew gives as a reason why a marriage must be broken refers to a situation peculiar to his community : the violation of Mosaic law forbidding marriage between persons of certain blood and/or legal relationship ( Lv 18:6–18 ) . Marriages of that sort were regarded as incest ( porneia ) , but some rabbis allowed Gentile converts to Judaism who had contracted such marriages to remain in them . Matthew ’ s “ exceptive clause ” is against such permissiveness for Gentile converts to Christianity ; cf . the similar prohibition of porneia in Acts 15:20 ,
NABRE	Matthew	5	2	Kgs 23:10 ; Jer 7:31 ) . In Jos 18:16 ( Septuagint , Codex Vaticanus ) the Hebrew is transliterated into Greek as gaienna , which appears in the New Testament as geenna . The concept of punishment of sinners by fire either after death or after the final judgment is found in Jewish apocalyptic literature ( e.g. , Enoch 90:26 ) but the name geenna is first given to the place of punishment in the New Testament . - 5:27 See Ex 20:14 ; Dt 5:18 . - 5:29–30 No sacrifice is too great to avoid total destruction in Gehenna . - 5:31–32 See Dt 24:1–5 . The Old Testament commandment that a bill of divorce be given to the woman assumes the legitimacy of divorce itself . It is this that Jesus denies . ( Unless the marriage is unlawful ) : this “ exceptive clause , ” as it is often called , occurs also in Mt 19:9 , where the Greek is slightly different . There are other sayings of Jesus about divorce that prohibit it absolutely ( see Mk 10:11–12 ; Lk 16:18 ; cf .
NABRE	Matthew	5	3	“ Blessed are the poor in spirit , [ d ] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . ( A )

NABRE	Matthew	5	6	, 11–12 ) , a section on the new righteousness with illustrations ( Mt 5:17 , 20–24 , 27–28 , 33–48 ) , a section on good works ( Mt 6:1–6 , 16–18 ) , and three warnings ( Mt 7:1–2 , 15–21 , 24–27 ) . - 5:1–2 Unlike Luke ’ s sermon , this is addressed not only to the disciples but to the crowds ( see Mt 7:28 ) . - 5:3–12 The form Blessed are ( is ) occurs frequently in the Old Testament in the Wisdom literature and in the psalms . Although modified by Matthew , the first , second , fourth , and ninth beatitudes have Lucan parallels ( Mt 5:3 // Lk 6:20 ; Mt 5:4 // Lk 6:21b ; Mt 5:6 // Lk 6:21a ; Mt 5:11–12 // Lk 5:22–23 ) . The others were added by the evangelist and are probably his own composition . A few manuscripts , Western and Alexandrian , and many versions and patristic quotations give the second and third beatitudes in inverted order . - 5:3 The poor in spirit : in the Old Testament , the poor ( ’ anāwîm ) are those who are without material possessions and whose confidence is in God ( see Is 61:1 ; Zep 2:3 ; in the NAB the word is translated lowly and humble , respectively , in those texts ) . Matthew added in spirit in order either to indicate that only the devout poor were meant or to extend the beatitude to all , of whatever social rank , who recognized their complete dependence on God . The same phrase poor in spirit is found in the Qumran literature ( 1QM 14:7 ) . - 5:4 Cf . Is 61:2 , “ ( The Lord has sent me ) …to comfort all who mourn. ” They will be comforted : here the passive is a “ theological passive ” equivalent to the active “ God will comfort them ” ; so also in Mt 5:6 ,
NABRE	Matthew	5	7	. - 5:5 Cf . Ps 37:11 , “ …the meek shall possess the land. ” In the psalm “ the land ” means the land of Palestine ; here it means the kingdom . - 5:6 For righteousness : a Matthean addition . For the meaning of righteousness here , see note on Mt 3:14–15 . - 5:8 Cf . Ps 24:4 . Only one “ whose heart is clean ” can take part in the temple worship . To be with God in the temple is described in Ps 42:3 as “ beholding his face , ” but here the promise to the clean of heart is that they will see God not in the temple but in the coming kingdom . - 5:10 Righteousness here , as usually in Matthew , means conduct in conformity with God ’ s will . - 5:12 The prophets who were before you : the disciples of Jesus stand in the line of the persecuted prophets of Israel . Some would see the expression as indicating also that Matthew considered all Christian disciples as prophets . - 5:13–16 By their deeds the disciples are to influence the world for good . They can no more escape notice than a city set on a mountain . If they fail in good works , they are as useless as flavorless salt or as a lamp whose light is concealed . - 5:13 The unusual supposition of salt losing its flavor has led some to suppose that the saying refers to the salt of the Dead Sea that , because chemically impure , could lose its taste . - 5:17–20 This statement of Jesus ’ position concerning the Mosaic law is composed of traditional material from Matthew ’ s sermon documentation ( see note on Mt 5:1–7:29 ) , other Q material ( cf . Mt

NABRE	Matthew	5	17	[ m ] “ Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets . I have come not to abolish but to fulfill .
NABRE	Matthew	5	18	; Lk 16:17 ) , and the evangelist ’ s own editorial touches . To fulfill the law appears at first to mean a literal enforcement of the law in the least detail : until heaven and earth pass away nothing of the law will pass ( Mt 5:18 ) . Yet the “ passing away ” of heaven and earth is not necessarily the end of the world understood , as in much apocalyptic literature , as the dissolution of the existing universe . The “ turning of the ages ” comes with the apocalyptic event of Jesus ’ death and resurrection , and those to whom this gospel is addressed are living in the new and final age , prophesied by Isaiah as the time of “ new heavens and a new earth ” ( Is 65:17 ; 66:22 ) . Meanwhile , during Jesus ’ ministry when the kingdom is already breaking in , his mission remains within the framework of the law , though with significant anticipation of the age to come , as the following antitheses ( Mt 5:21–48 ) show . - 5:19 Probably these commandments means those of the Mosaic law . But this is an interim ethic “ until heaven and earth pass away. ” - 5:21–48 Six examples of the conduct demanded of the Christian disciple . Each deals with a commandment of the law , introduced by You have heard that it was said to your ancestors or an equivalent formula , followed by Jesus ’ teaching in respect to that commandment , But I say to you ; thus their designation as “ antitheses. ” Three of them accept the Mosaic law but extend or deepen it ( Mt 5:21–22 ; 27–28 ; 43–44 ) ; three reject it as a standard of conduct for the disciples ( Mt 5:31–32 ; 33–37 ; 38–39 ) . - 5:21 Cf . Ex 20:13 ; Dt 5:17 . The second part of the verse is not an exact quotation from the Old Testament , but cf . Ex 21:12 . - 5:22–26 Reconciliation with an offended brother is urged in the admonition of Mt 5:23–24 and the parable of Mt 5:25–26 ( // Lk 12:58–59 ) . The severity of the judge in the parable is a warning of the fate of unrepentant sinners in the coming judgment by God . - 5:22 Anger is the motive behind murder , as the insulting epithets are steps that may lead to it . They , as well as the deed , are all forbidden . Raqa : an Aramaic word rēqā ’ or rēqâ probably meaning “ imbecile , ” “ blockhead , ” a term of abuse . The ascending order of punishment , judgment ( by a local council ? ) , trial before the Sanhedrin , condemnation to Gehenna , points to a higher degree of seriousness in each of the offenses . Sanhedrin : the highest judicial body of Judaism . Gehenna : in Hebrew gê-hinnōm , “ Valley of Hinnom , ” or gê ben-hinnōm , “ Valley of the son of Hinnom , ” southwest of Jerusalem , the center of an idolatrous cult during the monarchy in which children were offered in sacrifice ( see

NABRE	Matthew	5	29	. In this interpretation , the clause constitutes no exception to the absolute prohibition of divorce when the marriage is lawful . - 5:33 This is not an exact quotation of any Old Testament text , but see Ex 20:7 ; Dt 5:11 ; Lv 19:12 . The purpose of an oath was to guarantee truthfulness by one ’ s calling on God as witness . - 5:34–36 The use of these oath formularies that avoid the divine name is in fact equivalent to swearing by it , for all the things sworn by are related to God . - 5:37 Let your ‘ Yes ’ mean ‘ Yes , ’ and your ‘ No ’ mean ‘ No ’ : literally , “ let your speech be ‘ Yes , yes , ’ ‘ No , no. ’ ” Some have understood this as a milder form of oath , permitted by Jesus . In view of Mt 5:34 , “ Do not swear at all , ” that is unlikely . From the evil one : i.e. , from the devil . Oath-taking presupposes a sinful weakness of the human race , namely , the tendency to lie . Jesus demands of his disciples a truthfulness that makes oaths unnecessary . - 5:38–42 See Lv 24:20 . The Old Testament commandment was meant to moderate vengeance ; the punishment should not exceed the injury done . Jesus forbids even this proportionate retaliation . Of the five examples that follow , only the first deals directly with retaliation for evil ; the others speak of liberality . - 5:41 Roman garrisons in Palestine had the right to requisition the property and services of the native population . - 5:43–48 See Lv 19:18 . There is no Old Testament commandment demanding hatred of one ’ s enemy , but the “ neighbor ” of the love commandment was understood as one ’ s fellow countryman . Both in the Old Testament ( Ps 139:19–22 ) and at Qumran ( 1QS 9:21 ) hatred of evil persons is assumed to be right . Jesus extends the love commandment to the enemy and the persecutor . His disciples , as children of God , must imitate the example of their Father , who grants his gifts of sun and rain to both the good and the bad . - 5:46 Tax collectors : Jews who were engaged in the collection of indirect taxes such as tolls and customs . See note on Mk 2:14 . - 5:47 Jesus ’ disciples must not be content with merely usual standards of conduct ; see Mt 5:20 where the verb “ surpass ” ( Greek perisseuō ) is cognate with the unusual ( perisson ) of this verse . - 5:48 Perfect : in the gospels this word occurs only in Matthew , here and in Mt 19:21 . The Lucan parallel ( Lk 6:36 ) demands that the disciples be merciful .

The designation reflects an attitude resulting not only from the controversies at the time of Jesus ’ ministry but from the opposition between Pharisaic Judaism and the church of Matthew . They have received their reward : they desire praise and have received what they were looking for . - 6:7–15 Matthew inserts into his basic traditional material an expansion of the material on prayer that includes the model prayer , the “ Our Father. ” That prayer is found in Lk 11:2–4 in a different context and in a different form . - 6:7 The example of what Christian prayer should be like contrasts it now not with the prayer of the hypocrites but with that of the pagans . Their babbling probably means their reciting a long list of divine names , hoping that one of them will force a response from the deity . - 6:9–13 Matthew ’ s form of the “ Our Father ” follows the liturgical tradition of his church . Luke ’ s less developed form also represents the liturgical tradition known to him , but it is probably closer than Matthew ’ s to the original words of Jesus . - 6:9 Our Father in heaven : this invocation is found in many rabbinic prayers of the post-New Testament period . Hallowed be your name : though the “ hallowing ” of the divine name could be understood as reverence done to God by human praise and by obedience to his will , this is more probably a petition that God hallow his own name , i.e. , that he manifest his glory by an act of power ( cf . Ez 36:23 ) , in this case , by the establishment of his kingdom in its fullness . - 6:10 Your kingdom come : this petition sets the tone of the prayer , and inclines the balance toward divine rather than human action in the petitions that immediately precede and follow it . Your will be done , on earth as in heaven : a petition that the divine purpose to establish the kingdom , a purpose present now in heaven , be executed on earth . - 6:11 Give us today our daily bread : the rare Greek word epiousios , here daily , occurs in the New Testament only here and in Lk 11:3 . A single occurrence of the word outside of these texts and of literature dependent on them has been claimed , but the claim is highly doubtful . The word may mean daily or “ future ” ( other meanings have also been proposed ) . The latter would conform better to the eschatological tone of the whole prayer . So understood , the petition would be for a speedy coming of the kingdom ( today ) , which is often portrayed in both the Old Testament and the New under the image of a feast ( Is 25:6 ; Mt 8:11 ; 22:1–10 ; Lk 13:29 ; 14:15–24 ) . - 6:12 Forgive us our debts : the word debts is used metaphorically of sins , “ debts ” owed to God ( see Lk 11:4 ) . The request is probably for forgiveness at the final judgment . - 6:13 Jewish apocalyptic writings speak of a period of severe trial before the end of the age , sometimes called the “ messianic woes. ” This petition asks that the disciples be spared that final test . - 6:14–15 These verses reflect a set pattern called “ Principles of Holy Law. ” Human action now will be met by a corresponding action of God at the final judgment . - 6:16 The only fast prescribed in the Mosaic law was that of the Day of Atonement ( Lv 16:31 ) , but the practice of regular fasting was common in later Judaism ; cf . Didache 9:1 . - 6:19–34 The remaining material of this chapter is taken almost entirely from Q . It deals principally with worldly possessions , and the controlling thought is summed up in Mt 6:24 : the disciple can serve only one master and must choose between God and wealth ( mammon ) . See further the note on Lk 16:9 . - 6:22–23 In this context the parable probably points to the need for the disciple to be enlightened by Jesus ’ teaching on the transitory nature of earthly riches . - 6:24 Mammon : an Aramaic word meaning wealth or property . - 6:25–34 Jesus does not deny the reality of human needs ( Mt 6:32 ) , but forbids making them the object of anxious care and , in effect , becoming their slave . - 6:27 Life-span : the Greek word can also mean “ stature. ” If it is taken in that sense , the word here translated moment ( literally , “ cubit ” ) must be translated literally as a unit not of time but of spatial measure . The cubit is about eighteen inches . - 6:30 Of little faith : except for the parallel in Lk 12:28 , the word translated of little faith is found in the New Testament only in Matthew . It is used by him of those who are disciples of Jesus but whose faith in him is not as deep as it should be ( see Mt 8:26 ; 14:31 ; 16:8 and the cognate noun in Mt 17:20 ) . - 6:33 Righteousness : see note on Mt 3:14–15 .

NABRE	Matthew	6	34	Do not worry about tomorrow ; tomorrow will take care of itself . Sufficient for a day is its own evil . Footnotes - 6:1–18 The sermon continues with a warning against doing good in order to be seen and gives three examples , almsgiving ( Mt 6:2–4 ) , prayer ( Mt 6:5–15 ) , and fasting ( Mt 6:16–18 ) . In each , the conduct of the hypocrites ( Mt 6:2 ) is contrasted with that demanded of the disciples . The sayings about reward found here and elsewhere ( Mt 5:12 ,
NABRE	Matthew	6	46	; 10:41–42 ) show that this is a genuine element of Christian moral exhortation . Possibly to underline the difference between the Christian idea of reward and that of the hypocrites , the evangelist uses two different Greek verbs to express the rewarding of the disciples and that of the hypocrites ; in the latter case it is the verb apechō , a commercial term for giving a receipt for what has been paid in full ( Mt 6:2 ,

This saying may originally have derived from a Jewish Christian community opposed to preaching the gospel ( what is holy , pearls ) to Gentiles . In the light of Mt 28:19 that can hardly be Matthew ’ s meaning . He may have taken the saying as applying to a Christian dealing with an obstinately impenitent fellow Christian ( Mt 18:17 ) . - 7:9–10 There is a resemblance between a stone and a round loaf of bread and between a serpent and the scaleless fish called barbut . - 7:12 See Lk 6:31 . This saying , known since the eighteenth century as the “ Golden Rule , ” is found in both positive and negative form in pagan and Jewish sources , both earlier and later than the gospel . This is the law and the prophets is an addition probably due to the evangelist . - 7:13–28 The final section of the discourse is composed of a series of antitheses , contrasting two kinds of life within the Christian community , that of those who obey the words of Jesus and that of those who do not . Most of the sayings are from Q and are found also in Luke . - 7:13–14 The metaphor of the “ two ways ” was common in pagan philosophy and in the Old Testament . In Christian literature it is found also in the Didache ( 1–6 ) and the Epistle of Barnabas ( 18–20 ) . - 7:15–20 Christian disciples who claimed to speak in the name of God are called prophets ( Mt 7:15 ) in Mt 10:41 ; Mt 23:34 . They were presumably an important group within the church of Matthew . As in the case of the Old Testament prophets , there were both true and false ones , and for Matthew the difference could be recognized by the quality of their deeds , the fruits ( Mt 7:16 ) . The mention of fruits leads to the comparison with trees , some producing good fruit , others bad . - 7:21–23 The attack on the false prophets is continued , but is broadened to include those disciples who perform works of healing and exorcism in the name of Jesus ( Lord ) but live evil lives . Entrance into the kingdom is only for those who do the will of the Father .

NABRE	Matthew	7	17	Just so , every good tree bears good fruit , and a rotten tree bears bad fruit .

NABRE	Matthew	8	8	The centurion said in reply , [ f ] “ Lord , I am not worthy to have you enter under my roof ; only say the word and my servant will be healed .
NABRE	Matthew	8	1	( A ) When Jesus came down from the mountain , great crowds followed him .
NABRE	Matthew	8	2	And then a leper [ b ] approached , did him homage , and said , “ Lord , if you wish , you can make me clean. ”
NABRE	Matthew	8	3	He stretched out his hand , touched him , and said , “ I will do it . Be made clean. ” His leprosy was cleansed immediately .
NABRE	Matthew	8	4	[ c ] Then Jesus said to him , “ See that you tell no one , but go show yourself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses prescribed ; ( B ) that will be proof for them. ” The Healing of a Centurion ’ s Servant . [ d ]
NABRE	Matthew	8	5	( C ) When he entered Capernaum , [ e ] a centurion approached him and appealed to him ,
NABRE	Matthew	8	6	saying , “ Lord , my servant is lying at home paralyzed , suffering dreadfully. ”
NABRE	Matthew	8	7	He said to him , “ I will come and cure him. ”
NABRE	Matthew	8	9	For I too am a person subject to authority , with soldiers subject to me . And I say to one , ‘ Go , ’ and he goes ; and to another , ‘ Come here , ’ and he comes ; and to my slave , ‘ Do this , ’ and he does it. ”
NABRE	Matthew	8	10	When Jesus heard this , he was amazed and said to those following him , “ Amen , I say to you , in no one in Israel [ g ] have I found such faith .
NABRE	Matthew	8	11	( D ) I say to you , [ h ] many will come from the east and the west , and will recline with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob at the banquet in the kingdom of heaven ,
NABRE	Matthew	8	12	but the children of the kingdom will be driven out into the outer darkness , where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth. ”
NABRE	Matthew	8	13	And Jesus said to the centurion , “ You may go ; as you have believed , let it be done for you. ” And at that very hour [ his ] servant was healed . The Cure of Peter ’ s Mother-in-Law . [ i ]
NABRE	Matthew	8	14	( E ) Jesus entered the house of Peter , and saw his mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever .
NABRE	Matthew	8	15	He touched her hand , the fever left her , and she rose and waited on him . ( F ) Other Healings .
NABRE	Matthew	8	16	When it was evening , they brought him many who were possessed by demons , and he drove out the spirits by a word [ j ] and cured all the sick ,
NABRE	Matthew	8	17	to fulfill what had been said by Isaiah the prophet : [ k ] ( G ) “ He took away our infirmities and bore our diseases. ” The Would-be Followers of Jesus . [ l ]
NABRE	Matthew	8	18	( H ) When Jesus saw a crowd around him , he gave orders to cross to the other side . [ m ]
NABRE	Matthew	8	19	( I ) A scribe approached and said to him , “ Teacher , [ n ] I will follow you wherever you go. ”
NABRE	Matthew	8	20	Jesus answered him , “ Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests , but the Son of Man [ o ] has nowhere to rest his head. ”
NABRE	Matthew	8	21	Another of [ his ] disciples said to him , “ Lord , let me go first and bury my father. ”
NABRE	Matthew	8	22	[ p ] But Jesus answered him , “ Follow me , and let the dead bury their dead. ” The Calming of the Storm at Sea .
NABRE	Matthew	8	23	[ q ] ( J ) He got into a boat and his disciples followed him .
NABRE	Matthew	8	24	,
NABRE	Matthew	8	25	; 23:8 ; 26:18 ) , yet when it is used of him by others they are either his opponents ( Mt 9:11 ; 12:38 ; 17:24 ; 22:16 ,
NABRE	Matthew	8	26	He said to them , “ Why are you terrified , O you of little faith ? ” [ t ] Then he got up , rebuked the winds and the sea , and there was great calm .
NABRE	Matthew	8	27	The men were amazed and said , “ What sort of man is this , whom even the winds and the sea obey ? ” The Healing of the Gadarene Demoniacs .
NABRE	Matthew	8	28	( L ) When he came to the other side , to the territory of the Gadarenes , [ u ] two demoniacs who were coming from the tombs met him . They were so savage that no one could travel by that road .
NABRE	Matthew	8	29	They cried out , “ What have you to do with us , [ v ] Son of God ? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	8	30	Some distance away a herd of many swine was feeding . [ w ]
NABRE	Matthew	8	31	The demons pleaded with him , “ If you drive us out , send us into the herd of swine. ” ( M )
NABRE	Matthew	8	32	And he said to them , “ Go then ! ” They came out and entered the swine , and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea where they drowned .
NABRE	Matthew	8	33	The swineherds ran away , and when they came to the town they reported everything , including what had happened to the demoniacs .
NABRE	Matthew	8	34	Thereupon the whole town came out to meet Jesus , and when they saw him they begged him to leave their district . Footnotes - 8:1–9:38 This narrative section of the second book of the gospel is composed of nine miracle stories , most of which are found in Mark , although Matthew does not follow the Marcan order and abbreviates the stories radically . The stories are arranged in three groups of three , each group followed by a section composed principally of sayings of Jesus about discipleship . Mt 9:35 is an almost verbatim repetition of Mt 4:23 . Each speaks of Jesus ’ teaching , preaching , and healing . The teaching and preaching form the content of Mt 5–7 ; the healing , that of Mt 8–9 . Some scholars speak of a portrayal of Jesus as “ Messiah of the Word ” in Mt 5–7 and “ Messiah of the Deed ” in Mt 8–9 . That is accurate so far as it goes , but there is also a strong emphasis on discipleship in Mt 8–9 ; these chapters have not only christological but ecclesiological import . - 8:2 A leper : see note on Mk 1:40 . - 8:4 Cf . Lv 14:2–9 . That will be proof for them : the Greek can also mean “ that will be proof against them. ” It is not clear whether them refers to the priests or the people . - 8:5–13 This story comes from Q ( see Lk 7:1–10 ) and is also reflected in Jn 4:46–54 . The similarity between the Q story and the Johannine is due to a common oral tradition , not to a common literary source . As in the later story of the daughter of the Canaanite woman ( Mt 15:21–28 ) Jesus here breaks with his usual procedure of ministering only to Israelites and anticipates the mission to the Gentiles . - 8:5 A centurion : a military officer commanding a hundred men . He was probably in the service of Herod Antipas , tetrarch of Galilee ; see note on Mt 14:1 . - 8:8–9 Acquainted by his position with the force of a command , the centurion expresses faith in the power of Jesus ’ mere word . - 8:10 In no one in Israel : there is good textual attestation ( e.g. , Codex Sinaiticus ) for a reading identical with that of Lk 7:9 , “ not even in Israel. ” But that seems to be due to a harmonization of Matthew with Luke . - 8:11–12 Matthew inserts into the story a Q saying ( see Lk 13:28–29 ) about the entrance of Gentiles into the kingdom and the exclusion of those Israelites who , though descended from the patriarchs and members of the chosen nation ( the children of the kingdom ) , refused to believe in Jesus . There will be wailing and grinding of teeth : the first occurrence of a phrase used frequently in this gospel to describe final condemnation ( Mt 13:42 ,
NABRE	Matthew	8	50	; 22:13 ; 24:51 ; 25:30 ) . It is found elsewhere in the New Testament only in Lk 13:28 . - 8:14–15 Cf . Mk 1:29–31 . Unlike Mark , Matthew has no implied request by others for the woman ’ s cure . Jesus acts on his own initiative , and the cured woman rises and waits not on “ them ” ( Mk 1:31 ) but on him . - 8:16 By a word : a Matthean addition to Mk 1:34 ; cf . 8:8 . - 8:17 This fulfillment citation from Is 53:4 follows the MT , not the LXX . The prophet speaks of the Servant of the Lord who suffers vicariously for the sins ( “ infirmities ” ) of others ; Matthew takes the infirmities as physical afflictions . - 8:18–22 This passage between the first and second series of miracles about following Jesus is taken from Q ( see Lk 9:57–62 ) . The third of the three sayings found in the source is absent from Matthew . - 8:18 The other side : i.e. , of the Sea of Galilee . - 8:19 Teacher : for Matthew , this designation of Jesus is true , for he has Jesus using it of himself ( Mt 10:24 ,
NABRE	Matthew	8	36	) or , as here and in Mt 19:16 , well-disposed persons who can not see more deeply . Thus it reveals an inadequate recognition of who Jesus is . - 8:20 Son of Man : see note on Mk 8:31 . This is the first occurrence in Matthew of a term that appears in the New Testament only in sayings of Jesus , except for Acts 7:56 and possibly Mt 9:6 ( // Mk 2:10 ; Lk 5:24 ) . In Matthew it refers to Jesus in his ministry ( seven times , as here ) , in his passion and resurrection ( nine times , e.g. , Mt 17:22 ) , and in his glorious coming at the end of the age ( thirteen times , e.g. , Mt 24:30 ) . - 8:22 Let the dead bury their dead : the demand of Jesus overrides what both the Jewish and the Hellenistic world regarded as a filial obligation of the highest importance . See note on Lk 9:60 . - 8:23 His disciples followed him : the first miracle in the second group ( Mt 8:23–9:8 ) is introduced by a verse that links it with the preceding sayings by the catchword “ follow. ” In Mark the initiative in entering the boat is taken by the disciples ( Mk 4:35–41 ) ; here , Jesus enters first and the disciples follow . - 8:24 Storm : literally , “ earthquake , ” a word commonly used in apocalyptic literature for the shaking of the old world when God brings in his kingdom . All the synoptics use it in depicting the events preceding the parousia of the Son of Man ( Mt 24:7 ; Mk 13:8 ; Lk 21:11 ) . Matthew has introduced it here and in his account of the death and resurrection of Jesus ( Mt 27:51–54 ; 28:2 ) . - 8:25 The reverent plea of the disciples contrasts sharply with their reproach of Jesus in Mk 4:38 . - 8:26 You of little faith : see note on Mt 6:30 . Great calm : Jesus ’ calming the sea may be meant to recall the Old Testament theme of God ’ s control over the chaotic waters ( Ps 65:8 ; 89:10 ; 93:3–4 ; 107:29 ) . - 8:28 Gadarenes : this is the reading of Codex Vaticanus , supported by other important textual witnesses . The original reading of Codex Sinaiticus was Gazarenes , later changed to Gergesenes , and a few versions have Gerasenes . Each of these readings points to a different territory connected , respectively , with the cities Gadara , Gergesa , and Gerasa ( modern Jerash ) . There is the same confusion of readings in the parallel texts , Mk 5:1 and Lk 8:26 ; there the best reading seems to be “ Gerasenes , ” whereas “ Gadarenes ” is probably the original reading in Matthew . The town of Gadara was about five miles southeast of the Sea of Galilee , and Josephus ( Life 9:42 ) refers to it as possessing territory that lay on that sea . Two demoniacs : Mark ( 5:1–20 ) has one . - 8:29 What have you to do with us ? : see note on Jn 2:4 . Before the appointed time : the notion that evil spirits were allowed by God to afflict human beings until the time of the final judgment is found in Enoch 16:1 and Jubilees 10:7–10 . - 8:30 The tending of pigs , animals considered unclean by Mosaic law ( Lv 11:6–7 ) , indicates that the population was Gentile .

NABRE	Matthew	9	9	As Jesus passed on from there , ( D ) he saw a man named Matthew [ f ] sitting at the customs post . He said to him , “ Follow me. ” And he got up and followed him .
NABRE	Matthew	9	1	Kgs 22:17 . - 9:37–38 This Q saying ( see Lk 10:2 ) is only imperfectly related to this context . It presupposes that only God ( the master of the harvest ) can take the initiative in sending out preachers of the gospel , whereas in Matthew ’ s setting it leads into Mt
NABRE	Matthew	9	2	And there people brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher . When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the paralytic , “ Courage , child , your sins are forgiven. ” ( B )
NABRE	Matthew	9	3	At that , some of the scribes [ b ] said to themselves , “ This man is blaspheming. ”
NABRE	Matthew	9	4	Jesus knew what they were thinking , and said , “ Why do you harbor evil thoughts ?
NABRE	Matthew	9	5	Which is easier , to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise and walk ’ ?
NABRE	Matthew	9	6	[ c ] But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ” —he then said to the paralytic , “ Rise , pick up your stretcher , and go home. ” ( C )

NABRE	Matthew	9	13	Go and learn the meaning of the words , ( F ) ‘ I desire mercy , not sacrifice. ’ [ j ] I did not come to call the righteous but sinners. ” The Question About Fasting .
NABRE	Matthew	9	14	( G ) Then the disciples of John approached him and said , “ Why do we and the Pharisees fast [ much ] , but your disciples do not fast ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	9	15	Jesus answered them , “ Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them ? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and then they will fast . [ k ]
NABRE	Matthew	9	16	No one patches an old cloak with a piece of unshrunken cloth , [ l ] for its fullness pulls away from the cloak and the tear gets worse .
NABRE	Matthew	9	17	People do not put new wine into old wineskins . Otherwise the skins burst , the wine spills out , and the skins are ruined . Rather , they pour new wine into fresh wineskins , and both are preserved. ” The Official ’ s Daughter and the Woman with a Hemorrhage .
NABRE	Matthew	9	18	[ m ] While he was saying these things to them , ( H ) an official [ n ] came forward , knelt down before him , and said , “ My daughter has just died . But come , lay your hand on her , and she will live. ”
NABRE	Matthew	9	19	Jesus rose and followed him , and so did his disciples .
NABRE	Matthew	9	20	A woman suffering hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the tassel [ o ] on his cloak .
NABRE	Matthew	9	21	She said to herself , “ If only I can touch his cloak , I shall be cured. ” ( I )
NABRE	Matthew	9	22	Jesus turned around and saw her , and said , “ Courage , daughter ! Your faith has saved you. ” And from that hour the woman was cured .
NABRE	Matthew	9	23	When Jesus arrived at the official ’ s house and saw the flute players and the crowd who were making a commotion ,
NABRE	Matthew	9	24	he said , “ Go away ! The girl is not dead but sleeping. ” [ p ] And they ridiculed him .
NABRE	Matthew	9	25	When the crowd was put out , he came and took her by the hand , and the little girl arose .
NABRE	Matthew	9	26	And news of this spread throughout all that land . The Healing of Two Blind Men . [ q ]
NABRE	Matthew	9	27	( J ) And as Jesus passed on from there , two blind men followed [ him ] , crying out , “ Son of David , [ r ] have pity on us ! ” ( K )
NABRE	Matthew	9	28	When he entered the house , the blind men approached him and Jesus said to them , “ Do you believe that I can do this ? ” “ Yes , Lord , ” they said to him .
NABRE	Matthew	9	29	Then he touched their eyes and said , “ Let it be done for you according to your faith. ”
NABRE	Matthew	9	30	And their eyes were opened . Jesus warned them sternly , “ See that no one knows about this. ”
NABRE	Matthew	9	31	But they went out and spread word of him through all that land . The Healing of a Mute Person .
NABRE	Matthew	9	32	( L ) As they were going out , [ s ] a demoniac who could not speak was brought to him ,
NABRE	Matthew	9	33	and when the demon was driven out the mute person spoke . The crowds were amazed and said , “ Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel. ” ( M )
NABRE	Matthew	9	34	[ t ] But the Pharisees said , ( N ) “ He drives out demons by the prince of demons. ” The Compassion of Jesus .
NABRE	Matthew	9	35	[ u ] ( O ) Jesus went around to all the towns and villages , teaching in their synagogues , proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom , and curing every disease and illness .
NABRE	Matthew	9	36	( P ) At the sight of the crowds , his heart was moved with pity for them because they were troubled and abandoned , [ v ] like sheep without a shepherd .
NABRE	Matthew	9	37	[ w ] ( Q ) Then he said to his disciples , “ The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few ;
NABRE	Matthew	9	38	so ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest. ” Footnotes - 9:1 His own town : Capernaum ; see Mt 4:13 . - 9:3 Scribes : see note on Mk 2:6 . Matthew omits the reason given in the Marcan story for the charge of blasphemy : “ Who but God alone can forgive sins ? ” ( Mk 2:7 ) . - 9:6 It is not clear whether But that you may know…to forgive sins is intended to be a continuation of the words of Jesus or a parenthetical comment of the evangelist to those who would hear or read this gospel . In any case , Matthew here follows the Marcan text . - 9:8 Who had given such authority to human beings : a significant difference from Mk 2:12 ( “ They…glorified God , saying , ‘ We have never seen anything like this ’ ” ) . Matthew ’ s extension to human beings of the authority to forgive sins points to the belief that such authority was being claimed by Matthew ’ s church . - 9:9–17 In this section the order is the same as that of Mk 2:13–22 . - 9:9 A man named Matthew : Mark names this tax collector Levi ( Mk 2:14 ) . No such name appears in the four lists of the twelve who were the closest companions of Jesus ( Mt 10:2–4 ; Mk 3:16–19 ; Lk 6:14–16 ; Acts 1:13 [ eleven , because of the defection of Judas Iscariot ] ) , whereas all four list a Matthew , designated in Mt 10:3 as “ the tax collector. ” The evangelist may have changed the “ Levi ” of his source to Matthew so that this man , whose call is given special notice , like that of the first four disciples ( Mt 4:18–22 ) , might be included among the twelve . Another reason for the change may be that the disciple Matthew was the source of traditions peculiar to the church for which the evangelist was writing . - 9:10 His house : it is not clear whether his refers to Jesus or Matthew . Tax collectors : see note on Mt 5:46 . Table association with such persons would cause ritual impurity . - 9:11 Teacher : see note on Mt 8:19 . - 9:12 See note on Mk 2:17 . - 9:13 Go and learn…not sacrifice : Matthew adds the prophetic statement of Hos 6:6 to the Marcan account ( see also Mt 12:7 ) . If mercy is superior to the temple sacrifices , how much more to the laws of ritual impurity . - 9:15 Fasting is a sign of mourning and would be as inappropriate at this time of joy , when Jesus is proclaiming the kingdom , as it would be at a marriage feast . Yet the saying looks forward to the time when Jesus will no longer be with the disciples visibly , the time of Matthew ’ s church . Then they will fast : see Didache 8:1 . - 9:16–17 Each of these parables speaks of the unsuitability of attempting to combine the old and the new . Jesus ’ teaching is not a patching up of Judaism , nor can the gospel be contained within the limits of Mosaic law . - 9:18–34 In this third group of miracles , the first ( Mt 9:18–26 ) is clearly dependent on Mark ( Mk 5:21–43 ) . Though it tells of two miracles , the cure of the woman had already been included within the story of the raising of the official ’ s daughter , so that the two were probably regarded as a single unit . The other miracles seem to have been derived from Mark and Q , respectively , though there Matthew ’ s own editing is much more evident . - 9:18 Official : literally , “ ruler. ” Mark calls him “ one of the synagogue officials ” ( Mk 5:22 ) . My daughter has just died : Matthew heightens the Marcan “ my daughter is at the point of death ” ( Mk 5:23 ) . - 9:20 Tassel : possibly “ fringe. ” The Mosaic law prescribed that tassels be worn on the corners of one ’ s garment as a reminder to keep the commandments ( see Nm 15:37–39 ; Dt 22:12 ) . - 9:24 Sleeping : sleep is a biblical metaphor for death ( see Ps 87:6 LXX ; Dn 12:2 ;

NABRE	Matthew	10	34	) distinguish between the Twelve and a larger group also termed disciples , Matthew tends to identify the disciples and the Twelve . Authority…every illness : activities the same as those of Jesus ; see Mt 4:23 ; Mt 9:35 ; 10:8 . The Twelve also share in his proclamation of the kingdom ( Mt 10:7 ) . But although he teaches ( Mt 4:23 ; 7:28 ; 9:35 ) , they do not . Their commission to teach comes only after Jesus ’ resurrection , after they have been fully instructed by him ( Mt 28:20 ) . - 10:2–4 Here , for the only time in Matthew , the Twelve are designated apostles . The word “ apostle ” means “ one who is sent , ” and therefore fits the situation here described . In the Pauline letters , the place where the term occurs most frequently in the New Testament , it means primarily one who has seen the risen Lord and has been commissioned to proclaim the resurrection . With slight variants in Luke and Acts , the names of those who belong to this group are the same in the four lists given in the New Testament ( see note on Mt 9:9 ) . Cananean : this represents an Aramaic word meaning “ zealot. ” The meaning of that designation is unclear ( see note on Lk 6:15 ) . - 10:5–6 Like Jesus ( Mt 15:24 ) , the Twelve are sent only to Israel . This saying may reflect an original Jewish Christian refusal of the mission to the Gentiles , but for Matthew it expresses rather the limitation that Jesus himself observed during his ministry . - 10:8–11 The Twelve have received their own call and mission through God ’ s gift , and the benefits they confer are likewise to be given freely . They are not to take with them money , provisions , or unnecessary clothing ; their lodging and food will be provided by those who receive them . - 10:13 The greeting of peace is conceived of not merely as a salutation but as an effective word . If it finds no worthy recipient , it will return to the speaker . - 10:14 Shake the dust from your feet : this gesture indicates a complete disassociation from such unbelievers . - 10:17 The persecutions attendant upon the post-resurrection mission now begin to be spoken of . Here Matthew brings into the discourse sayings found in Mk
NABRE	Matthew	10	35	For I have come to set a man ‘ against his father , a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law ;
NABRE	Matthew	10	36	. - 10:22 To the end : the original meaning was probably “ until the parousia. ” But it is not likely that Matthew expected no missionary disciples to suffer death before then , since he envisages the martyrdom of other Christians ( Mt 10:21 ) . For him , the end is probably that of the individual ’ s life ( see Mt 10:28 ) . - 10:23 Before the Son of Man comes : since the coming of the Son of Man at the end of the age had not taken place when this gospel was written , much less during the mission of the Twelve during Jesus ’ ministry , Matthew can not have meant the coming to refer to the parousia . It is difficult to know what he understood it to be : perhaps the “ proleptic parousia ” of Mt 28:16–20 , or the destruction of the temple in A.D.
NABRE	Matthew	10	37	( U ) “ Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me , and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me ;
NABRE	Matthew	10	38	and whoever does not take up his cross [ o ] and follow after me is not worthy of me .
NABRE	Matthew	10	39	[ p ] ( V ) Whoever finds his life will lose it , and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it . Rewards .

NABRE	Matthew	10	41	[ r ] Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet ’ s reward , and whoever receives a righteous man because he is righteous will receive a righteous man ’ s reward .
NABRE	Matthew	10	42	And whoever gives only a cup of cold water to one of these little ones to drink because he is a disciple—amen , I say to you , he will surely not lose his reward. ” ( X ) Footnotes - 10:1–11:1 After an introductory narrative ( Mt 10:1–4 ) , the second of the discourses of the gospel . It deals with the mission now to be undertaken by the disciples ( Mt 10:5–15 ) , but the perspective broadens and includes the missionary activity of the church between the time of the resurrection and the parousia . - 10:1 His twelve disciples : although , unlike Mark ( Mk 3:13–14 ) and Luke ( Lk 6:12–16 ) , Matthew has no story of Jesus ’ choosing the Twelve , he assumes that the group is known to the reader . The earliest New Testament text to speak of it is
NABRE	Matthew	10	70	, viewed as a coming of Jesus in judgment on unbelieving Israel . - 10:25 Beelzebul : see Mt 9:34 for the charge linking Jesus with “ the prince of demons , ” who is named Beelzebul in Mt 12:24 . The meaning of the name is uncertain ; possibly , “ lord of the house. ” - 10:26 The concealed and secret coming of the kingdom is to be proclaimed by them , and no fear must be allowed to deter them from that proclamation . - 10:32–33 In the Q parallel ( Lk 12:8–9 ) , the Son of Man will acknowledge those who have acknowledged Jesus , and those who deny him will be denied ( by the Son of Man ) before the angels of God at the judgment . Here Jesus and the Son of Man are identified , and the acknowledgment or denial will be before his heavenly Father . - 10:38 The first mention of the cross in Matthew , explicitly that of the disciple , but implicitly that of Jesus ( and follow after me ) . Crucifixion was a form of capital punishment used by the Romans for offenders who were not Roman citizens . - 10:39 One who denies Jesus in order to save one ’ s earthly life will be condemned to everlasting destruction ; loss of earthly life for Jesus ’ sake will be rewarded by everlasting life in the kingdom . - 10:40–42 All who receive the disciples of Jesus receive him , and God who sent him , and will be rewarded accordingly . - 10:41 A prophet : one who speaks in the name of God ; here , the Christian prophets who proclaim the gospel . Righteous man : since righteousness is demanded of all the disciples , it is difficult to take the righteous man of this verse and one of these little ones ( Mt 10:42 ) as indicating different groups within the followers of Jesus . Probably all three designations are used here of Christian missionaries as such .

NABRE	Matthew	11	8	Then what did you go out to see ? Someone dressed in fine clothing ? Those who wear fine clothing are in royal palaces .

NABRE	Matthew	11	20	( J ) Then he began to reproach the towns where most of his mighty deeds had been done , since they had not repented .
NABRE	Matthew	11	21	“ Woe to you , Chorazin ! Woe to you , Bethsaida ! For if the mighty deeds done in your midst had been done in Tyre and Sidon , [ l ] they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes . ( K )

Jer 6:16 . Scripture texts , prefaces , introductions , footnotes and cross references used in this work are taken from the New American Bible , revised edition ©

NABRE	Matthew	11	30	For my yoke is easy , and my burden light. ” Footnotes - 11:1 The closing formula of the discourse refers back to the original addressees , the Twelve . - 11:2–12:50 The narrative section of the third book deals with the growing opposition to Jesus . It is largely devoted to disputes and attacks relating to faith and discipleship and thus contains much sayings-material , drawn in large part from Q . - 11:2 In prison : see Mt 4:12 ; 14:1–12 . The works of the Messiah : the deeds of Mt 8–9 . - 11:3 The question probably expresses a doubt of the Baptist that Jesus is the one who is to come ( cf . Mal 3:1 ) because his mission has not been one of fiery judgment as John had expected ( Mt 3:2 ) . - 11:5–6 Jesus ’ response is taken from passages of Isaiah ( Is 26:19 ; 29:18–19 ; 35:5–6 ; 61:1 ) that picture the time of salvation as marked by deeds such as those that Jesus is doing . The beatitude is a warning to the Baptist not to disbelieve because his expectations have not been met . - 11:7–19 Jesus ’ rebuke of John is counterbalanced by a reminder of the greatness of the Baptist ’ s function ( Mt 11:7–15 ) that is followed by a complaint about those who have heeded neither John nor Jesus ( Mt 11:16–19 ) . - 11:9–10 In common Jewish belief there had been no prophecy in Israel since the last of the Old Testament prophets , Malachi . The coming of a new prophet was eagerly awaited , and Jesus agrees that John was such . Yet he was more than a prophet , for he was the precursor of the one who would bring in the new and final age . The Old Testament quotation is a combination of Mal 3:1 ; Ex 23:20 with the significant change that the before me of Malachi becomes before you . The messenger now precedes not God , as in the original , but Jesus . - 11:11 John ’ s preeminent greatness lies in his function of announcing the imminence of the kingdom ( Mt 3:1 ) . But to be in the kingdom is so great a privilege that the least who has it is greater than the Baptist . - 11:12 The meaning of this difficult saying is probably that the opponents of Jesus are trying to prevent people from accepting the kingdom and to snatch it away from those who have received it . - 11:13 All the prophets and the law : Matthew inverts the usual order , “ law and prophets , ” and says that both have prophesied . This emphasis on the prophetic character of the law points to its fulfillment in the teaching of Jesus and to the transitory nature of some of its commandments ( see note on Mt 5:17–20 ) . - 11:16–19 See Lk 7:31–35 . The meaning of the parable ( Mt 11:16–17 ) and its explanation ( Mt 11:18–19b ) is much disputed . A plausible view is that the children of the parable are two groups , one of which proposes different entertainments to the other that will not agree with either proposal . The first represents John , Jesus , and their disciples ; the second those who reject John for his asceticism and Jesus for his table association with those despised by the religiously observant . Mt 11:19c ( her works ) forms an inclusion with Mt 11:2 ( “ the works of the Messiah ” ) . The original form of the saying is better preserved in Lk 7:35 “ …wisdom is vindicated by all her children. ” There John and Jesus are the children of Wisdom ; here the works of Jesus the Messiah are those of divine Wisdom , of which he is the embodiment . Some important textual witnesses , however , have essentially the same reading as in Luke . - 11:21 Tyre and Sidon were pagan cities denounced for their wickedness in the Old Testament ; cf . Jl 4:4–7 . - 11:23 Capernaum ’ s pride and punishment are described in language taken from the taunt song against the king of Babylon ( Is 14:13–15 ) . - 11:25–27 This Q saying , identical with Lk 10:21–22 except for minor variations , introduces a joyous note into this section , so dominated by the theme of unbelief . While the wise and the learned , the scribes and Pharisees , have rejected Jesus ’ preaching and the significance of his mighty deeds , the childlike have accepted them . Acceptance depends upon the Father ’ s revelation , but this is granted to those who are open to receive it and refused to the arrogant . Jesus can speak of all mysteries because he is the Son and there is perfect reciprocity of knowledge between him and the Father ; what has been handed over to him is revealed only to those whom he wishes . - 11:28–29 These verses are peculiar to Matthew and are similar to Ben Sirach ’ s invitation to learn wisdom and submit to her yoke ( Sir 51:23 ,

NABRE	Matthew	12	1	Kgs 10:1–13 ) were pagans who responded to lesser opportunities than have been offered to Israel in the ministry of Jesus , something greater than Jonah or Solomon . At the final judgment they will condemn the faithless generation that has rejected him . - 12:43–45 Another Q passage ; cf . Mt 11:24–26 . Jesus ’ ministry has broken Satan ’ s hold over Israel , but the refusal of this evil generation to accept him will lead to a worse situation than what preceded his coming . - 12:46–50 See Mk 3:31–35 . Matthew has omitted Mk 3:20–21 which is taken up in Mk 3:31 ( see note on Mt 12:22–32 ) , yet the point of the story is the same in both gospels : natural kinship with Jesus counts for nothing ; only one who does the will of his heavenly Father belongs to his true family . - 12:47 This verse is omitted in some important textual witnesses , including Codex Sinaiticus ( original reading ) and Codex Vaticanus .

NABRE	Matthew	12	2	When the Pharisees saw this , they said to him , “ See , your disciples are doing what is unlawful to do on the sabbath. ”
NABRE	Matthew	12	3	He said to them , [ c ] “ Have you not read what David ( C ) did when he and his companions were hungry ,
NABRE	Matthew	12	4	how he went into the house of God and ate the bread of offering , ( D ) which neither he nor his companions but only the priests could lawfully eat ?
NABRE	Matthew	12	5	[ d ] Or have you not read in the law that on the sabbath the priests serving in the temple violate the sabbath and are innocent ? ( E )
NABRE	Matthew	12	6	I say to you , something greater than the temple is here .
NABRE	Matthew	12	7	[ e ] If you knew what this meant , ‘ I desire mercy , not sacrifice , ’ ( F ) you would not have condemned these innocent men .
NABRE	Matthew	12	8	[ f ] ( G ) For the Son of Man is Lord of the sabbath. ” The Man with a Withered Hand .
NABRE	Matthew	12	9	( H ) Moving on from there , he went into their synagogue .
NABRE	Matthew	12	10	And behold , there was a man there who had a withered hand . They questioned him , “ Is it lawful to cure on the sabbath ? ” [ g ] so that they might accuse him .
NABRE	Matthew	12	11	[ h ] He said to them , “ Which one of you who has a sheep that falls into a pit on the sabbath will not take hold of it and lift it out ?
NABRE	Matthew	12	13	Then he said to the man , “ Stretch out your hand. ” He stretched it out , and it was restored as sound as the other .
NABRE	Matthew	12	14	But the Pharisees [ i ] went out and took counsel against him to put him to death . ( I ) The Chosen Servant . [ j ]
NABRE	Matthew	12	15	When Jesus realized this , he withdrew from that place . Many [ people ] followed him , and he cured them all , [ k ]
NABRE	Matthew	12	16	) that pick up the withdrawal , the healings , and the command for silence . To this he adds a fulfillment citation from the first Servant Song ( Is 42:1–4 ) that does not correspond exactly to either the Hebrew or the LXX of that passage . It is the longest Old Testament citation in this gospel , emphasizing the meekness of Jesus , the Servant of the Lord , and foretelling the extension of his mission to the Gentiles . - 12:15 Jesus ’ knowledge of the Pharisees ’ plot and his healing all are peculiar to Matthew . - 12:19 The servant ’ s not contending is seen as fulfilled in Jesus ’ withdrawal from the disputes narrated in Mt 12:1–14 . - 12:21 Except for a minor detail , Matthew here follows the LXX , although the meaning of the Hebrew ( “ the coastlands will wait for his teaching ” ) is similar . - 12:22–32 For the exorcism , see note on Mt 9:32–34 . The long discussion combines Marcan and Q material ( Mk 3:22–30 ; Lk 11:19–20 ,
NABRE	Matthew	12	17	This was to fulfill what had been spoken through Isaiah the prophet :
NABRE	Matthew	12	18	“ Behold , my servant whom I have chosen , ( J ) my beloved in whom I delight ; I shall place my spirit upon him , and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles .
NABRE	Matthew	12	19	He will not contend [ l ] or cry out , nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets .

NABRE	Matthew	12	22	( K ) Then they brought to him a demoniac who was blind and mute . He cured the mute person so that he could speak and see .
NABRE	Matthew	12	23	; 12:10 ) . Mk 3:20–21 is omitted , with a consequent lessening of the sharpness of Mt 12:48 . - 12:23 See note on Mt 9:27 . - 12:24 See note on Mt 10:25 . - 12:25–26 Jesus ’ first response to the Pharisees ’ charge is that if it were true , Satan would be destroying his own kingdom . - 12:27 Besides pointing out the absurdity of the charge , Jesus asks how the work of Jewish exorcists ( your own people ) is to be interpreted . Are they , too , to be charged with collusion with Beelzebul ? For an example of Jewish exorcism see Josephus , Antiquities 8:42–49 . - 12:28 The Q parallel ( Lk 11:20 ) speaks of the “ finger ” rather than of the “ spirit ” of God . While the difference is probably due to Matthew ’ s editing , he retains the kingdom of God rather than changing it to his usual “ kingdom of heaven. ” Has come upon you : see Mt 4:17 . - 12:29 A short parable illustrates what Jesus is doing . The strong man is Satan , whom Jesus has tied up and whose house he is plundering . Jewish expectation was that Satan would be chained up in the last days ( Rev 20:2 ) ; Jesus ’ exorcisms indicate that those days have begun . - 12:30 This saying , already attached to the preceding verses in Q ( see Lk 11:23 ) , warns that there can be no neutrality where Jesus is concerned . Its pertinence in a context where Jesus is addressing not the neutral but the bitterly opposed is not clear . The accusation of scattering , however , does fit the situation . Jesus is the shepherd of God ’ s people ( Mt 2:6 ) , his mission is to the lost sheep of Israel ( Mt 15:24 ) ; the Pharisees , who oppose him , are guilty of scattering the sheep . - 12:31 Blasphemy against the Spirit : the sin of attributing to Satan ( Mt 12:24 ) what is the work of the Spirit of God ( Mt 12:28 ) . - 12:33 Declare : literally , “ make. ” The meaning of this verse is obscure . Possibly it is a challenge to the Pharisees either to declare Jesus and his exorcisms good or both of them bad . A tree is known by its fruit ; if the fruit is good , so must the tree be . If the driving out of demons is good , so must its source be . - 12:34 The admission of Jesus ’ goodness can not be made by the Pharisees , for they are evil , and the words that proceed from their evil hearts can not be good . - 12:36–37 If on the day of judgment people will be held accountable for even their careless words , the vicious accusations of the Pharisees will surely lead to their condemnation . - 12:38–42 This section is mainly from Q ( see Lk 11:29–32 ) . Mk 8:11–12 , which Matthew has followed in Mt 16:1–4 , has a similar demand for a sign . The scribes and Pharisees refuse to accept the exorcisms of Jesus as authentication of his claims and demand a sign that will end all possibility of doubt . Jesus ’ response is that no such sign will be given . Because his opponents are evil and see him as an agent of Satan , nothing will convince them . - 12:38 Teacher : see note on Mt 8:19 . In Mt 16:1 the request is for a sign “ from heaven ” ( Mk 8:11 ) . - 12:39 Unfaithful : literally , “ adulterous. ” The covenant between God and Israel was portrayed as a marriage bond , and unfaithfulness to the covenant as adultery ; cf . Hos 2:4–14 ; Jer 3:6–10 . - 12:40 See Jon 2:1 . While in Q the sign was simply Jonah ’ s preaching to the Ninevites ( Lk 11:30 ,
NABRE	Matthew	12	24	[ p ] ( M ) But when the Pharisees heard this , they said , “ This man drives out demons only by the power of Beelzebul , the prince of demons. ”
NABRE	Matthew	12	25	( N ) But he knew what they were thinking and said to them , [ q ] “ Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste , and no town or house divided against itself will stand .
NABRE	Matthew	12	26	And if Satan drives out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how , then , will his kingdom stand ?
NABRE	Matthew	12	27	And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul , by whom do your own people [ r ] drive them out ? Therefore they will be your judges .
NABRE	Matthew	12	28	[ s ] ( O ) But if it is by the Spirit of God that I drive out demons , then the kingdom of God has come upon you .
NABRE	Matthew	12	29	[ t ] How can anyone enter a strong man ’ s house and steal his property , unless he first ties up the strong man ? Then he can plunder his house .
NABRE	Matthew	12	30	[ u ] ( P ) Whoever is not with me is against me , and whoever does not gather with me scatters .

NABRE	Matthew	12	32	) , Matthew here adds Jonah ’ s sojourn in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights , a prefigurement of Jesus ’ sojourn in the abode of the dead and , implicitly , of his resurrection . - 12:41–42 The Ninevites who repented ( see Jon 3:1–10 ) and the queen of the south ( i.e. , of Sheba ; see

NABRE	Matthew	12	34	[ x ] ( S ) You brood of vipers , how can you say good things when you are evil ? For from the fullness of the heart the mouth speaks .
NABRE	Matthew	12	35	A good person brings forth good out of a store of goodness , but an evil person brings forth evil out of a store of evil .

NABRE	Matthew	12	38	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him , “ Teacher , [ aa ] we wish to see a sign from you. ” ( U )
NABRE	Matthew	12	39	He said to them in reply , “ An evil and unfaithful [ ab ] generation seeks a sign , but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah the prophet .
NABRE	Matthew	12	40	Just as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights , [ ac ] so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights .
NABRE	Matthew	12	41	[ ad ] At the judgment , the men of Nineveh will arise with this generation and condemn it , because they repented at the preaching of Jonah ; and there is something greater than Jonah here .
NABRE	Matthew	12	42	At the judgment the queen of the south will arise with this generation and condemn it , because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and there is something greater than Solomon here . ( V ) The Return of the Unclean Spirit . [ ae ]
NABRE	Matthew	12	43	( W ) “ When an unclean spirit goes out of a person it roams through arid regions searching for rest but finds none .
NABRE	Matthew	12	44	Then it says , ‘ I will return to my home from which I came. ’ But upon returning , it finds it empty , swept clean , and put in order .
NABRE	Matthew	12	45	Then it goes and brings back with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself , and they move in and dwell there ; and the last condition of that person is worse than the first . Thus it will be with this evil generation. ” The True Family of Jesus . [ af ]
NABRE	Matthew	12	46	( X ) While he was still speaking to the crowds , his mother and his brothers appeared outside , wishing to speak with him .
NABRE	Matthew	12	47	[ Someone told him , “ Your mother and your brothers are standing outside , asking to speak with you. ” ] [ ag ]
NABRE	Matthew	12	48	But he said in reply to the one who told him , “ Who is my mother ? Who are my brothers ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	12	49	And stretching out his hand toward his disciples , he said , “ Here are my mother and my brothers .
NABRE	Matthew	12	50	For whoever does the will of my heavenly Father is my brother , and sister , and mother. ” Footnotes - 12:1–14 Matthew here returns to the Marcan order that he left in Mt 9:18 . The two stories depend on Mk 2:23–28 ; 3:1–6 , respectively , and are the only places in either gospel that deal explicitly with Jesus ’ attitude toward sabbath observance . - 12:1–2 The picking of the heads of grain is here equated with reaping , which was forbidden on the sabbath ( Ex 34:21 ) . - 12:3–4 See

NABRE	Matthew	13	13	[ f ] ( C ) This is why I speak to them in parables , because ‘ they look but do not see and hear but do not listen or understand. ’
NABRE	Matthew	13	1	Cor 15:24–25 . The church is the place where Jesus ’ kingdom is manifested , but his royal authority embraces the entire world ; see note on Mt 13:38 . - 13:43 See Dn 12:3 . - 13:44–50 The first two of the last three parables of the discourse have the same point . The person who finds a buried treasure and the merchant who finds a pearl of great price sell all that they have to acquire these finds ; similarly , the one who understands the supreme value of the kingdom gives up whatever he must to obtain it . The joy with which this is done is made explicit in the first parable , but it may be presumed in the second also . The concluding parable of the fishnet resembles the explanation of the parable of the weeds with its stress upon the final exclusion of evil persons from the kingdom . - 13:44 In the unsettled conditions of Palestine in Jesus ’ time , it was not unusual to guard valuables by burying them in the ground . - 13:51 Matthew typically speaks of the understanding of the disciples . - 13:52 Since Matthew tends to identify the disciples and the Twelve ( see note on Mt 10:1 ) , this saying about the Christian scribe can not be taken as applicable to all who accept the message of Jesus . While the Twelve are in many ways representative of all who believe in him , they are also distinguished from them in certain respects . The church of Matthew has leaders among whom are a group designated as “ scribes ” ( Mt 23:34 ) . Like the scribes of Israel , they are teachers . It is the Twelve and these their later counterparts to whom this verse applies . The scribe…instructed in the kingdom of heaven knows both the teaching of Jesus ( the new ) and the law and prophets ( the old ) and provides in his own teaching both the new and the old as interpreted and fulfilled by the new . On the translation head of a household ( for the same Greek word translated householder in Mt 13:27 ) , see note on Mt 24:45–51 . - 13:54–17:27 This section is the narrative part of the fourth book of the gospel . - 13:54–58 After the Sermon on the Mount the crowds are in admiring astonishment at Jesus ’ teaching ( Mt 7:28 ) ; here the astonishment is of those who take offense at him . Familiarity with his background and family leads them to regard him as pretentious . Matthew modifies his Marcan source ( Mt 6:1–6 ) . Jesus is not the carpenter but the carpenter ’ s son ( Mt 13:55 ) , “ and among his own kin ” is omitted ( Mt 13:57 ) , he did not work many mighty deeds in face of such unbelief ( Mt 13:58 ) rather than the Marcan “ …he was not able to perform any mighty deed there ” ( Mt 6:5 ) , and there is no mention of his amazement at his townspeople ’ s lack of faith . Scripture texts , prefaces , introductions , footnotes and cross references used in this work are taken from the New American Bible , revised edition ©
NABRE	Matthew	13	2	Chr 29:30 , but it is doubtful that Matthew averted to that ; for him , any Old Testament text that could be seen as fulfilled in Jesus was prophetic . - 13:36 Dismissing the crowds : the return of Jesus to the house marks a break with the crowds , who represent unbelieving Israel . From now on his attention is directed more and more to his disciples and to their instruction . The rest of the discourse is addressed to them alone . - 13:37–43 In the explanation of the parable of the weeds emphasis lies on the fearful end of the wicked , whereas the parable itself concentrates on patience with them until judgment time . - 13:38 The field is the world : this presupposes the resurrection of Jesus and the granting to him of “ all power in heaven and on earth ” ( Mt 28:18 ) . - 13:39 The end of the age : this phrase is found only in Matthew ( 13:40 ,
NABRE	Matthew	13	3	) those who believe , but in whom the word is choked by worldly anxiety and the seduction of riches ( Mt 13:22 ) ; (
NABRE	Matthew	13	4	) those who respond to the word and produce fruit abundantly ( Mt 13:23 ) . - 13:24–30 This parable is peculiar to Matthew . The comparison in Mt 13:24 does not mean that the kingdom of heaven may be likened simply to the person in question but to the situation narrated in the whole story . The refusal of the householder to allow his slaves to separate the wheat from the weeds while they are still growing is a warning to the disciples not to attempt to anticipate the final judgment of God by a definitive exclusion of sinners from the kingdom . In its present stage it is composed of the good and the bad . The judgment of God alone will eliminate the sinful . Until then there must be patience and the preaching of repentance . - 13:25 Weeds : darnel , a poisonous weed that in its first stage of growth resembles wheat . - 13:30 Harvest : a common biblical metaphor for the time of God ’ s judgment ; cf . Jer 51:33 ; Jl 4:13 ; Hos 6:11 . - 13:31–33 See Mk 4:30–32 ; Lk 13:18–21 . The parables of the mustard seed and the yeast illustrate the same point : the amazing contrast between the small beginnings of the kingdom and its marvelous expansion . - 13:32 See Dn 4:7–9 , 17–19 where the birds nesting in the tree represent the people of Nebuchadnezzar ’ s kingdom . See also Ez 17:23 ; 31:6 . - 13:33 Except in this Q parable and in Mt 16:12 , yeast ( or “ leaven ” ) is , in New Testament usage , a symbol of corruption ( see Mt 16:6 , 11–12 ; Mk 8:15 ; Lk 12:1 ;
NABRE	Matthew	13	5	Some fell on rocky ground , where it had little soil . It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep ,
NABRE	Matthew	13	6	and when the sun rose it was scorched , and it withered for lack of roots .
NABRE	Matthew	13	7	Some seed fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up and choked it .
NABRE	Matthew	13	8	But some seed fell on rich soil , and produced fruit , a hundred or sixty or thirtyfold .
NABRE	Matthew	13	9	Whoever has ears ought to hear. ” The Purpose of Parables .
NABRE	Matthew	13	10	The disciples approached him and said , “ Why do you speak to them in parables ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	13	11	[ d ] He said to them in reply , “ Because knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven has been granted to you , but to them it has not been granted .
NABRE	Matthew	13	12	( B ) To anyone who has , more will be given [ e ] and he will grow rich ; from anyone who has not , even what he has will be taken away .
NABRE	Matthew	13	14	( D ) Isaiah ’ s prophecy is fulfilled in them , which says : ‘ You shall indeed hear but not understand , you shall indeed look but never see .
NABRE	Matthew	13	15	Gross is the heart of this people , they will hardly hear with their ears , they have closed their eyes , lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and be converted , and I heal them. ’ The Privilege of Discipleship . [ g ]
NABRE	Matthew	13	16	( E ) “ But blessed are your eyes , because they see , and your ears , because they hear .
NABRE	Matthew	13	17	Amen , I say to you , many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it , and to hear what you hear but did not hear it . The Explanation of the Parable of the Sower . [ h ]
NABRE	Matthew	13	18	( F ) “ Hear then the parable of the sower .
NABRE	Matthew	13	19	,
NABRE	Matthew	13	20	The seed sown on rocky ground is the one who hears the word and receives it at once with joy .
NABRE	Matthew	13	21	But he has no root and lasts only for a time . When some tribulation or persecution comes because of the word , he immediately falls away .
NABRE	Matthew	13	22	The seed sown among thorns is the one who hears the word , but then worldly anxiety and the lure of riches choke the word and it bears no fruit .
NABRE	Matthew	13	23	But the seed sown on rich soil is the one who hears the word and understands it , who indeed bears fruit and yields a hundred or sixty or thirtyfold. ” The Parable of the Weeds Among the Wheat .
NABRE	Matthew	13	24	He proposed another parable to them . [ i ] “ The kingdom of heaven may be likened to a man who sowed good seed in his field .
NABRE	Matthew	13	25	While everyone was asleep his enemy came and sowed weeds [ j ] all through the wheat , and then went off .
NABRE	Matthew	13	26	When the crop grew and bore fruit , the weeds appeared as well .
NABRE	Matthew	13	27	and in the Qumran literature ( 1QpHab 7:8 ; 1QS 3:23 ; 1QM 3:9 ) to designate a divine plan or decree affecting the course of history that can be known only when revealed . Knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven means recognition that the kingdom has become present in the ministry of Jesus . - 13:12 In the New Testament use of this axiom of practical “ wisdom ” ( see Mt 25:29 ; Mk 4:25 ; Lk 8:18 ; 19:26 ) , the reference transcends the original level . God gives further understanding to one who accepts the revealed mystery ; from the one who does not , he will take it away ( note the “ theological passive , ” more will be given , what he has will be taken away ) . - 13:13 Because ‘ they look…or understand ’ : Matthew softens his Marcan source , which states that Jesus speaks in parables so that the crowds may not understand ( Mk 4:12 ) , and makes such speaking a punishment given because they have not accepted his previous clear teaching . However , his citation of Is 6:9–10 in Mt 13:14 supports the harsher Marcan view . - 13:16–17 Unlike the unbelieving crowds , the disciples have seen that which the prophets and the righteous of the Old Testament longed to see without having their longing fulfilled . - 13:18–23 See Mk 4:14–20 ; Lk 8:11–15 . In this explanation of the parable the emphasis is on the various types of soil on which the seed falls , i.e. , on the dispositions with which the preaching of Jesus is received . The second and third types particularly are explained in such a way as to support the view held by many scholars that the explanation derives not from Jesus but from early Christian reflection upon apostasy from the faith that was the consequence of persecution and worldliness , respectively . Others , however , hold that the explanation may come basically from Jesus even though it was developed in the light of later Christian experience . The four types of persons envisaged are (
NABRE	Matthew	13	28	He answered , ‘ An enemy has done this. ’ His slaves said to him , ‘ Do you want us to go and pull them up ? ’
NABRE	Matthew	13	29	He replied , ‘ No , if you pull up the weeds you might uproot the wheat along with them .
NABRE	Matthew	13	30	Let them grow together until harvest ; [ k ] then at harvest time I will say to the harvesters , “ First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles for burning ; but gather the wheat into my barn. ” ’ ” ( G ) The Parable of the Mustard Seed . [ l ]
NABRE	Matthew	13	31	( H ) He proposed another parable to them . “ The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a person took and sowed in a field .
NABRE	Matthew	13	32	[ m ] ( I ) It is the smallest of all the seeds , yet when full-grown it is the largest of plants . It becomes a large bush , and the ‘ birds of the sky come and dwell in its branches. ’ ” The Parable of the Yeast .
NABRE	Matthew	13	33	He spoke to them another parable . “ The kingdom of heaven is like yeast [ n ] that a woman took and mixed with three measures of wheat flour until the whole batch was leavened. ” ( J ) The Use of Parables .
NABRE	Matthew	13	34	[ o ] ( K ) All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables . He spoke to them only in parables ,
NABRE	Matthew	13	35	to fulfill what had been said through the prophet : [ p ] “ I will open my mouth in parables , I will announce what has lain hidden from the foundation [ of the world ] . ” ( L ) The Explanation of the Parable of the Weeds .
NABRE	Matthew	13	36	Then , dismissing the crowds , [ q ] he went into the house . His disciples approached him and said , “ Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field. ”
NABRE	Matthew	13	37	[ r ] He said in reply , “ He who sows good seed is the Son of Man ,
NABRE	Matthew	13	38	the field is the world , [ s ] the good seed the children of the kingdom . The weeds are the children of the evil one ,
NABRE	Matthew	13	39	and the enemy who sows them is the devil . The harvest is the end of the age , [ t ] and the harvesters are angels .
NABRE	Matthew	13	40	Just as weeds are collected and burned [ up ] with fire , so will it be at the end of the age .
NABRE	Matthew	13	41	The Son of Man will send his angels , and they will collect out of his kingdom [ u ] all who cause others to sin and all evildoers .
NABRE	Matthew	13	42	( M ) They will throw them into the fiery furnace , where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth .
NABRE	Matthew	13	43	[ v ] ( N ) Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father . Whoever has ears ought to hear . More Parables . [ w ]
NABRE	Matthew	13	44	( O ) “ The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure buried in a field , [ x ] which a person finds and hides again , and out of joy goes and sells all that he has and buys that field .
NABRE	Matthew	13	45	Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls .
NABRE	Matthew	13	46	When he finds a pearl of great price , he goes and sells all that he has and buys it .
NABRE	Matthew	13	47	Again , the kingdom of heaven is like a net thrown into the sea , which collects fish of every kind .
NABRE	Matthew	13	48	When it is full they haul it ashore and sit down to put what is good into buckets . What is bad they throw away .
NABRE	Matthew	13	49	; 24:3 ; 28:20 ) . - 13:41 His kingdom : the kingdom of the Son of Man is distinguished from that of the Father ( Mt 13:43 ) ; see
NABRE	Matthew	13	50	and throw them into the fiery furnace , where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth . Treasures New and Old .
NABRE	Matthew	13	51	“ Do you understand [ y ] all these things ? ” They answered , “ Yes. ”
NABRE	Matthew	13	52	[ z ] And he replied , “ Then every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like the head of a household who brings from his storeroom both the new and the old. ”
NABRE	Matthew	13	53	When Jesus finished these parables , he went away from there . V. Jesus , the Kingdom , and the Church The Rejection at Nazareth .
NABRE	Matthew	13	54	[ aa ] He came to his native place and taught the people in their synagogue . ( P ) They were astonished [ ab ] and said , “ Where did this man get such wisdom and mighty deeds ? ( Q )
NABRE	Matthew	13	55	Is he not the carpenter ’ s son ? Is not his mother named Mary and his brothers James , Joseph , Simon , and Judas ? ( R )
NABRE	Matthew	13	56	Are not his sisters all with us ? Where did this man get all this ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	13	57	And they took offense at him . But Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is not without honor except in his native place and in his own house. ” ( S )
NABRE	Matthew	13	58	And he did not work many mighty deeds there because of their lack of faith . Footnotes - 13:1–53 The discourse in parables is the third great discourse of Jesus in Matthew and constitutes the second part of the third book of the gospel . Matthew follows the Marcan outline ( Mk 4:1–35 ) but has only two of Mark ’ s parables , the five others being from Q and M. In addition to the seven parables , the discourse gives the reason why Jesus uses this type of speech ( Mt 13:10–15 ) , declares the blessedness of those who understand his teaching ( Mt 13:16–17 ) , explains the parable of the sower ( Mt 13:18–23 ) and of the weeds ( Mt 13:36–43 ) , and ends with a concluding statement to the disciples ( Mt 13:51–52 ) . - 13:3 In parables : the word “ parable ” ( Greek parabolē ) is used in the LXX to translate the Hebrew māshāl , a designation covering a wide variety of literary forms such as axioms , proverbs , similitudes , and allegories . In the New Testament the same breadth of meaning of the word is found , but there it primarily designates stories that are illustrative comparisons between Christian truths and events of everyday life . Sometimes the event has a strange element that is quite different from usual experience ( e.g. , in Mt 13:33 the enormous amount of dough in the parable of the yeast ) ; this is meant to sharpen the curiosity of the hearer . If each detail of such a story is given a figurative meaning , the story is an allegory . Those who maintain a sharp distinction between parable and allegory insist that a parable has only one point of comparison , and that while parables were characteristic of Jesus ’ teaching , to see allegorical details in them is to introduce meanings that go beyond their original intention and even falsify it . However , to exclude any allegorical elements from a parable is an excessively rigid mode of interpretation , now abandoned by many scholars . - 13:3–8 Since in Palestine sowing often preceded plowing , much of the seed is scattered on ground that is unsuitable . Yet while much is wasted , the seed that falls on good ground bears fruit in extraordinarily large measure . The point of the parable is that , in spite of some failure because of opposition and indifference , the message of Jesus about the coming of the kingdom will have enormous success . - 13:11 Since a parable is figurative speech that demands reflection for understanding , only those who are prepared to explore its meaning can come to know it . To understand is a gift of God , granted to the disciples but not to the crowds . In Semitic fashion , both the disciples ’ understanding and the crowd ’ s obtuseness are attributed to God . The question of human responsibility for the obtuseness is not dealt with , although it is asserted in Mt 13:13 . The mysteries : as in Lk 8:10 ; Mk 4:11 has “ the mystery. ” The word is used in Dn 2:18 ,

Since they were usual at any Jewish meal , that correspondence does not necessarily indicate a eucharistic reference here . Matthew ’ s silence about Jesus ’ dividing the fish among the people ( Mk 6:41 ) is perhaps more significant in that regard . - 14:20 The fragments left over : as in Elisha ’ s miracle , food was left over after all had been fed . The word fragments ( Greek klasmata ) is used , in the singular , of the broken bread of the Eucharist in Didache 9:3–4 . - 14:22–33 The disciples , laboring against the turbulent sea , are saved by Jesus . For his power over the waters , see note on Mt 8:26 . Here that power is expressed also by his walking on the sea ( Mt 14:25 ; cf . Ps 77:20 ; Jb 9:8 ) .

When the latter died , his territory was divided among three of his surviving sons , Archelaus who received half of it ( Mt 2:23 ) , Herod Antipas who became ruler of Galilee and Perea , and Philip who became ruler of northern Transjordan . Since he received a quarter of his father ’ s domain , Antipas is accurately designated tetrarch ( “ ruler of a fourth [ part ] ” ) , although in Mt 14:9 Matthew repeats the “ king ” of his Marcan source ( Mk 6:26 ) . - 14:3 Herodias was not the wife of Herod ’ s half-brother Philip but of another half-brother , Herod Boethus . The union was prohibited by Lv 18:16 ; 20:21 . According to Josephus ( Antiquities 18:116–19 ) , Herod imprisoned and then executed John because he feared that the Baptist ’ s influence over the people might enable him to lead a rebellion . - 14:13–21 The feeding of the five thousand is the only miracle of Jesus that is recounted in all four gospels . The principal reason for that may be that it was seen as anticipating the Eucharist and the final banquet in the kingdom ( Mt 8:11 ; 26:29 ) , but it looks not only forward but backward , to the feeding of Israel with manna in the desert at the time of the Exodus ( Ex

NABRE	Matthew	15	15	Then Peter [ g ] said to him in reply , “ Explain [ this ] parable to us. ”
NABRE	Matthew	15	1	( A ) Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said ,
NABRE	Matthew	15	2	( B ) “ Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders ? [ b ] They do not wash [ their ] hands when they eat a meal. ”
NABRE	Matthew	15	3	He said to them in reply , “ And why do you break the commandment of God [ c ] for the sake of your tradition ?
NABRE	Matthew	15	4	( C ) For God said , ‘ Honor your father and your mother , ’ and ‘ Whoever curses father or mother shall die. ’
NABRE	Matthew	15	5	[ d ] But you say , ‘ Whoever says to father or mother , “ Any support you might have had from me is dedicated to God , ”
NABRE	Matthew	15	6	need not honor his father. ’ You have nullified the word of God for the sake of your tradition .
NABRE	Matthew	15	7	Hypocrites , well did Isaiah prophesy about you when he said :
NABRE	Matthew	15	8	( D ) ‘ This people honors me with their lips , [ e ] but their hearts are far from me ;
NABRE	Matthew	15	9	( E ) in vain do they worship me , teaching as doctrines human precepts. ’ ”
NABRE	Matthew	15	10	( F ) He summoned the crowd and said to them , “ Hear and understand .
NABRE	Matthew	15	11	It is not what enters one ’ s mouth that defiles that person ; but what comes out of the mouth is what defiles one. ”
NABRE	Matthew	15	12	Then his disciples approached and said to him , “ Do you know that the Pharisees took offense when they heard what you said ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	15	13	He said in reply , [ f ] “ Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted .
NABRE	Matthew	15	14	( G ) Let them alone ; they are blind guides ( of the blind ) . If a blind person leads a blind person , both will fall into a pit. ”
NABRE	Matthew	15	16	He said to them , “ Are even you still without understanding ?
NABRE	Matthew	15	17	Do you not realize that everything that enters the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled into the latrine ?
NABRE	Matthew	15	18	( H ) But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart , and they defile .
NABRE	Matthew	15	19	[ h ] For from the heart come evil thoughts , murder , adultery , unchastity , theft , false witness , blasphemy .
NABRE	Matthew	15	20	These are what defile a person , but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile. ” The Canaanite Woman ’ s Faith . [ i ]
NABRE	Matthew	15	21	( I ) Then Jesus went from that place and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon .
NABRE	Matthew	15	22	And behold , a Canaanite woman of that district came and called out , “ Have pity on me , Lord , Son of David ! My daughter is tormented by a demon. ”
NABRE	Matthew	15	23	But he did not say a word in answer to her . His disciples came and asked him , “ Send her away , for she keeps calling out after us. ”
NABRE	Matthew	15	24	[ j ] He said in reply , “ I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. ”
NABRE	Matthew	15	25	( J ) But the woman came and did him homage , saying , “ Lord , help me. ”
NABRE	Matthew	15	26	He said in reply , “ It is not right to take the food of the children [ k ] and throw it to the dogs. ”
NABRE	Matthew	15	27	She said , “ Please , Lord , for even the dogs eat the scraps that fall from the table of their masters. ”
NABRE	Matthew	15	28	( K ) Then Jesus said to her in reply , “ O woman , great is your faith ! [ l ] Let it be done for you as you wish. ” And her daughter was healed from that hour . The Healing of Many People .
NABRE	Matthew	15	29	Moving on from there Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee , went up on the mountain , and sat down there .
NABRE	Matthew	15	30	( L ) Great crowds came to him , having with them the lame , the blind , the deformed , the mute , and many others . They placed them at his feet , and he cured them .
NABRE	Matthew	15	31	The crowds were amazed when they saw the mute speaking , the deformed made whole , the lame walking , and the blind able to see , and they glorified the God of Israel . The Feeding of the Four Thousand . [ m ]
NABRE	Matthew	15	32	( M ) Jesus summoned his disciples and said , “ My heart is moved with pity for the crowd , for they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat . I do not want to send them away hungry , for fear they may collapse on the way. ”
NABRE	Matthew	15	33	The disciples said to him , “ Where could we ever get enough bread in this deserted place to satisfy such a crowd ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	15	34	Jesus said to them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” “ Seven , ” they replied , “ and a few fish. ”
NABRE	Matthew	15	35	He ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground .
NABRE	Matthew	15	36	Then he took the seven loaves and the fish , gave thanks , [ n ] broke the loaves , and gave them to the disciples , who in turn gave them to the crowds .
NABRE	Matthew	15	37	( N ) They all ate and were satisfied . They picked up the fragments left over—seven baskets full .
NABRE	Matthew	15	38	Those who ate were four thousand men , not counting women and children .
NABRE	Matthew	15	39	And when he had dismissed the crowds , he got into the boat and came to the district of Magadan . Footnotes - 15:1–20 This dispute begins with the question of the Pharisees and scribes why Jesus ’ disciples are breaking the tradition of the elders about washing one ’ s hands before eating ( Mt 15:2 ) . Jesus ’ counterquestion accuses his opponents of breaking the commandment of God for the sake of their tradition ( Mt 15:3 ) and illustrates this by their interpretation of the commandment of the Decalogue concerning parents ( Mt 15:4–6 ) . Denouncing them as hypocrites , he applies to them a derogatory prophecy of Isaiah ( Mt 15:7–8 ) . Then with a wider audience ( the crowd , Mt 15:10 ) he goes beyond the violation of tradition with which the dispute has started . The parable ( Mt 15:11 ) is an attack on the Mosaic law concerning clean and unclean foods , similar to those antitheses that abrogate the law ( Mt 5:31–32 , 33–34 , 38–39 ) . After a warning to his disciples not to follow the moral guidance of the Pharisees ( Mt 15:13–14 ) , he explains the parable ( Mt 15:15 ) to them , saying that defilement comes not from what enters the mouth ( Mt 15:17 ) but from the evil thoughts and deeds that rise from within , from the heart ( Mt 15:18–20 ) . The last verse returns to the starting point of the dispute ( eating with unwashed hands ) . Because of Matthew ’ s omission of Mk 7:19b , some scholars think that Matthew has weakened the Marcan repudiation of the Mosaic food laws . But that half verse is ambiguous in the Greek , which may be the reason for its omission here . - 15:2 The tradition of the elders : see note on Mk 7:5 . The purpose of the handwashing was to remove defilement caused by contact with what was ritually unclean . - 15:3–4 For the commandment see Ex 20:12 ( Dt 5:16 ) ; 21:17 . The honoring of one ’ s parents had to do with supporting them in their needs . - 15:5 See note on Mk 7:11 . - 15:8 The text of Is 29:13 is quoted approximately according to the Septuagint . - 15:13–14 Jesus leads his disciples away from the teaching authority of the Pharisees . - 15:15 Matthew specifies Peter as the questioner , unlike Mk 7:17 . Given his tendency to present the disciples as more understanding than in his Marcan source , it is noteworthy that here he retains the Marcan rebuke , although in a slightly milder form . This may be due to his wish to correct the Jewish Christians within his church who still held to the food laws and thus separated themselves from Gentile Christians who did not observe them . - 15:19 The Marcan list of thirteen things that defile ( Mk 7:21–22 ) is here reduced to seven that partially cover the content of the Decalogue . - 15:21–28 See note on Mt 8:5–13 . - 15:24 See note on Mt 10:5–6 . - 15:26 The children : the people of Israel . Dogs : see note on Mt 7:6 . - 15:28 As in the case of the cure of the centurion ’ s servant ( Mt 8:10 ) , Matthew ascribes Jesus ’ granting the request to the woman ’ s great faith , a point not made equally explicit in the Marcan parallel ( Mk 7:24–30 ) . - 15:32–39 Most probably this story is a doublet of that of the feeding of the five thousand ( Mt 14:13–21 ) . It differs from it notably only in that Jesus takes the initiative , not the disciples ( Mt 15:32 ) , and in the numbers : the crowd has been with Jesus three days ( Mt 15:32 ) , seven loaves are multiplied ( Mt 15:36 ) , seven baskets of fragments remain after the feeding ( Mt 15:37 ) , and four thousand men are fed ( Mt 15:38 ) . - 15:36 Gave thanks : see Mt 14:19 , “ said the blessing. ” There is no difference in meaning . The thanksgiving was a blessing of God for his benefits .

NABRE	Matthew	16	4	B.C . until his death in A.D.
NABRE	Matthew	16	5	( D ) In coming to the other side of the sea , [ d ] the disciples had forgotten to bring bread .
NABRE	Matthew	16	6	( E ) Jesus said to them , “ Look out , and beware of the leaven [ e ] of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ”
NABRE	Matthew	16	7	[ f ] They concluded among themselves , saying , “ It is because we have brought no bread. ”
NABRE	Matthew	16	8	When Jesus became aware of this he said , “ You of little faith , why do you conclude among yourselves that it is because you have no bread ?
NABRE	Matthew	16	9	( F ) Do you not yet understand , and do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand , and how many wicker baskets you took up ?
NABRE	Matthew	16	10	( G ) Or the seven loaves for the four thousand , and how many baskets you took up ?
NABRE	Matthew	16	11	,
NABRE	Matthew	16	12	Then they understood [ g ] that he was not telling them to beware of the leaven of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees . Peter ’ s Confession About Jesus . [ h ]
NABRE	Matthew	16	13	( H ) When Jesus went into the region of Caesarea Philippi [ i ] he asked his disciples , “ Who do people say that the Son of Man is ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	16	14	) except in Gal 2:7–8 ( “ Peter ” ) . It is translated as Petros ( “ Peter ” ) in Jn 1:42 . The presumed original Aramaic of Jesus ’ statement would have been , in English , “ You are the Rock ( Kēpā ’ ) and upon this rock ( kēpā ’ ) I will build my church. ” The Greek text probably means the same , for the difference in gender between the masculine noun petros , the disciple ’ s new name , and the feminine noun petra ( rock ) may be due simply to the unsuitability of using a feminine noun as the proper name of a male . Although the two words were generally used with slightly different nuances , they were also used interchangeably with the same meaning , “ rock. ” Church : this word ( Greek ekklēsia ) occurs in the gospels only here and in Mt 18:17 ( twice ) . There are several possibilities for an Aramaic original . Jesus ’ church means the community that he will gather and that , like a building , will have Peter as its solid foundation . That function of Peter consists in his being witness to Jesus as the Messiah , the Son of the living God . The gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it : the netherworld ( Greek Hadēs , the abode of the dead ) is conceived of as a walled city whose gates will not close in upon the church of Jesus , i.e. , it will not be overcome by the power of death . - 16:19 The keys to the kingdom of heaven : the image of the keys is probably drawn from Is 22:15–25 where Eliakim , who succeeds Shebna as master of the palace , is given “ the key of the House of David , ” which he authoritatively “ opens ” and “ shuts ” ( Is 22:22 ) . Whatever you bind…loosed in heaven : there are many instances in rabbinic literature of the binding-loosing imagery . Of the several meanings given there to the metaphor , two are of special importance here : the giving of authoritative teaching , and the lifting or imposing of the ban of excommunication . It is disputed whether the image of the keys and that of binding and loosing are different metaphors meaning the same thing . In any case , the promise of the keys is given to Peter alone . In Mt 18:18 all the disciples are given the power of binding and loosing , but the context of that verse suggests that there the power of excommunication alone is intended . That the keys are those to the kingdom of heaven and that Peter ’ s exercise of authority in the church on earth will be confirmed in heaven show an intimate connection between , but not an identification of , the church and the kingdom of heaven . - 16:20 Cf . Mk 8:30 . Matthew makes explicit that the prohibition has to do with speaking of Jesus as the Messiah ; see note on Mk 8:27–30 . - 16:21–23 This first prediction of the passion follows Mk 8:31–33 in the main and serves as a corrective to an understanding of Jesus ’ messiahship as solely one of glory and triumph . By his addition of from that time on ( Mt 16:21 ) Matthew has emphasized that Jesus ’ revelation of his coming suffering and death marks a new phase of the gospel . Neither this nor the two later passion predictions ( Mt 17:22–23 ; 20:17–19 ) can be taken as sayings that , as they stand , go back to Jesus himself . However , it is probable that he foresaw that his mission would entail suffering and perhaps death , but was confident that he would ultimately be vindicated by God ( see Mt 26:29 ) . - 16:21 He : the Marcan parallel ( Mk 8:31 ) has “ the Son of Man. ” Since Matthew has already designated Jesus by that title ( Mt 15:13 ) , its omission here is not significant . The Matthean prediction is equally about the sufferings of the Son of Man . Must : this necessity is part of the tradition of all the synoptics ; cf . Mk 8:31 ; Lk 9:21 . The elders , the chief priests , and the scribes : see note on Mk 8:31 . On the third day : so also Lk 9:22 , against the Marcan “ after three days ” ( Mk 8:31 ) . Matthew ’ s formulation is , in the Greek , almost identical with the pre-Pauline fragment of the kerygma in
NABRE	Matthew	16	15	He said to them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	16	17	Jesus said to him in reply , “ Blessed are you , Simon son of Jonah . For flesh and blood [ l ] has not revealed this to you , but my heavenly Father .
NABRE	Matthew	16	18	( K ) And so I say to you , you are Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church , [ m ] and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it .
NABRE	Matthew	16	19	( L ) I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven . [ n ] Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven ; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. ”
NABRE	Matthew	16	20	[ o ] ( M ) Then he strictly ordered his disciples to tell no one that he was the Messiah . The First Prediction of the Passion . [ p ]
NABRE	Matthew	16	21	( N ) From that time on , Jesus began to show his disciples that he [ q ] must go to Jerusalem and suffer greatly from the elders , the chief priests , and the scribes , and be killed and on the third day be raised . ( O )
NABRE	Matthew	16	22	[ r ] Then Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him , “ God forbid , Lord ! No such thing shall ever happen to you. ”
NABRE	Matthew	16	23	( P ) He turned and said to Peter , “ Get behind me , Satan ! You are an obstacle to me . You are thinking not as God does , but as human beings do. ” The Conditions of Discipleship . [ s ]
NABRE	Matthew	16	24	( Q ) Then Jesus said to his disciples , “ Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself , [ t ] take up his cross , and follow me .
NABRE	Matthew	16	25	( R ) For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it . [ u ]
NABRE	Matthew	16	26	What profit would there be for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life ? Or what can one give in exchange for his life ?
NABRE	Matthew	16	27	[ v ] ( S ) For the Son of Man will come with his angels in his Father ’ s glory , and then he will repay everyone according to his conduct .
NABRE	Matthew	16	28	[ w ] Amen , I say to you , there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom. ” Footnotes - 16:1 A sign from heaven : see note on Mt 12:38–42 . - 16:2–3 The answer of Jesus in these verses is omitted in many important textual witnesses , and it is very uncertain that it is an original part of this gospel . It resembles Lk 12:54–56 and may have been inserted from there . It rebukes the Pharisees and Sadducees who are able to read indications of coming weather but not the indications of the coming kingdom in the signs that Jesus does offer , his mighty deeds and teaching . - 16:4 See notes on Mt 12:39 ,
NABRE	Matthew	16	40	. - 16:5–12 Jesus ’ warning his disciples against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees comes immediately before his promise to confer on Peter the authority to bind and to loose on earth ( Mt 16:19 ) , an authority that will be confirmed in heaven . Such authority most probably has to do , at least in part , with teaching . The rejection of the teaching authority of the Pharisees ( see also Mt 12:12–14 ) prepares for a new one derived from Jesus . - 16:6 Leaven : see note on Mt 13:33 . Sadducees : Matthew ’ s Marcan source speaks rather of “ the leaven of Herod ” ( Mk 8:15 ) . - 16:7–11 The disciples , men of little faith , misunderstand Jesus ’ metaphorical use of leaven , forgetting that , as the feeding of the crowds shows , he is not at a loss to provide them with bread . - 16:12 After his rebuke , the disciples understand that by leaven he meant the corrupting influence of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees . The evangelist probably understands this teaching as common to both groups . Since at the time of Jesus ’ ministry the two differed widely on points of teaching , e.g. , the resurrection of the dead , and at the time of the evangelist the Sadducee party was no longer a force in Judaism , the supposed common teaching fits neither period . The disciples ’ eventual understanding of Jesus ’ warning contrasts with their continuing obtuseness in the Marcan parallel ( Mk 8:14–21 ) . - 16:13–20 The Marcan confession of Jesus as Messiah , made by Peter as spokesman for the other disciples ( Mk 8:27–29 ; cf . also Lk 9:18–20 ) , is modified significantly here . The confession is of Jesus both as Messiah and as Son of the living God ( Mt 16:16 ) . Jesus ’ response , drawn principally from material peculiar to Matthew , attributes the confession to a divine revelation granted to Peter alone ( Mt 16:17 ) and makes him the rock on which Jesus will build his church ( Mt 16:18 ) and the disciple whose authority in the church on earth will be confirmed in heaven , i.e. , by God ( Mt 16:19 ) . - 16:13 Caesarea Philippi : situated about twenty miles north of the Sea of Galilee in the territory ruled by Philip , a son of Herod the Great , tetrarch from
NABRE	Matthew	16	34	( see note on Mt 14:1 ) . He rebuilt the town of Paneas , naming it Caesarea in honor of the emperor , and Philippi ( “ of Philip ” ) to distinguish it from the seaport in Samaria that was also called Caesarea . Who do people say that the Son of Man is ? : although the question differs from the Marcan parallel ( Mk 8:27 : “ Who…that I am ? ” ) , the meaning is the same , for Jesus here refers to himself as the Son of Man ( cf . Mt 16:15 ) . - 16:14 John the Baptist : see Mt 14:2 . Elijah : cf . Mal 3:32–34 ; Sir 48:10 ; and see note on Mt 3:4 . Jeremiah : an addition of Matthew to the Marcan source . - 16:16 The Son of the living God : see Mt 2:15 ; 3:17 . The addition of this exalted title to the Marcan confession eliminates whatever ambiguity was attached to the title Messiah . This , among other things , supports the view proposed by many scholars that Matthew has here combined his source ’ s confession with a post-resurrectional confession of faith in Jesus as Son of the living God that belonged to the appearance of the risen Jesus to Peter ; cf .
NABRE	Matthew	16	218	) and there is probably no difference in meaning between the two phrases . - 16:22–23 Peter ’ s refusal to accept Jesus ’ predicted suffering and death is seen as a satanic attempt to deflect Jesus from his God-appointed course , and the disciple is addressed in terms that recall Jesus ’ dismissal of the devil in the temptation account ( Mt 4:10 : “ Get away , Satan ! ” ) . Peter ’ s satanic purpose is emphasized by Matthew ’ s addition to the Marcan source of the words You are an obstacle to me . - 16:24–28 A readiness to follow Jesus even to giving up one ’ s life for him is the condition for true discipleship ; this will be repaid by him at the final judgment . - 16:24 Deny himself : to deny someone is to disown him ( see Mt 10:33 ; 26:34–35 ) and to deny oneself is to disown oneself as the center of one ’ s existence . - 16:25 See notes on Mt 10:38 ,
NABRE	Matthew	16	39	. - 16:27 The parousia and final judgment are described in Mt 25:31 in terms almost identical with these . - 16:28 Coming in his kingdom : since the kingdom of the Son of Man has been described as “ the world ” and Jesus ’ sovereignty precedes his final coming in glory ( Mt 13:38 ,

NABRE	Matthew	17	17	( I ) Jesus said in reply , “ O faithless and perverse [ o ] generation , how long will I be with you ? How long will I endure you ? Bring him here to me. ”
NABRE	Matthew	17	1	Kgs 19:8–18 ; Horeb = Sinai ) . - 17:2 His face shone like the sun : this is a Matthean addition ; cf . Dn 10:6 . His clothes became white as light : cf . Dn 7:9 , where the clothing of God appears “ snow bright. ” For the white garments of other heavenly beings , see Rev 4:4 ; 7:9 ; 19:14 . - 17:3 See note on Mk 9:5 . - 17:4 Three tents : the booths in which the Israelites lived during the feast of Tabernacles ( cf . Jn 7:2 ) were meant to recall their ancestors ’ dwelling in booths during the journey from Egypt to the promised land ( Lv 23:39–42 ) . The same Greek word , skēnē , here translated tents , is used in the LXX for the booths of that feast , and some scholars have suggested that there is an allusion here to that liturgical custom . - 17:5 Cloud cast a shadow over them : see note on Mk 9:7 . This is my beloved Son…listen to him : cf . Mt 3:17 . The voice repeats the baptismal proclamation about Jesus , with the addition of the command listen to him . The latter is a reference to Dt 18:15 in which the Israelites are commanded to listen to the prophet like Moses whom God will raise up for them . The command to listen to Jesus is general , but in this context it probably applies particularly to the preceding predictions of his passion and resurrection ( Mt 16:21 ) and of his coming ( Mt 16:27 ,
NABRE	Matthew	17	2	[ c ] ( B ) And he was transfigured before them ; his face shone like the sun and his clothes became white as light .
NABRE	Matthew	17	3	[ d ] And behold , Moses and Elijah appeared to them , conversing with him .

NABRE	Matthew	17	5	( C ) While he was still speaking , behold , a bright cloud cast a shadow over them , [ f ] then from the cloud came a voice that said , “ This is my beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased ; listen to him. ”
NABRE	Matthew	17	6	[ g ] When the disciples heard this , they fell prostrate and were very much afraid .
NABRE	Matthew	17	7	But Jesus came and touched them , saying , “ Rise , and do not be afraid. ”

NABRE	Matthew	17	10	[ j ] ( E ) Then the disciples asked him , “ Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	17	11	( F ) He said in reply , [ k ] “ Elijah will indeed come and restore all things ;
NABRE	Matthew	17	12	( G ) but I tell you that Elijah has already come , and they did not recognize him but did to him whatever they pleased . So also will the Son of Man suffer at their hands. ”
NABRE	Matthew	17	13	[ l ] Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist . The Healing of a Boy with a Demon . [ m ]
NABRE	Matthew	17	14	( H ) When they came to the crowd a man approached , knelt down before him ,
NABRE	Matthew	17	15	and said , “ Lord , have pity on my son , for he is a lunatic [ n ] and suffers severely ; often he falls into fire , and often into water .
NABRE	Matthew	17	16	I brought him to your disciples , but they could not cure him. ”
NABRE	Matthew	17	18	Jesus rebuked him and the demon came out of him , [ p ] and from that hour the boy was cured .

NABRE	Matthew	17	24	( L ) When they came to Capernaum , the collectors of the temple tax [ u ] approached Peter and said , “ Doesn ’ t your teacher pay the temple tax ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	17	25	“ Yes , ” he said . [ v ] When he came into the house , before he had time to speak , Jesus asked him , “ What is your opinion , Simon ? From whom do the kings of the earth take tolls or census tax ? From their subjects or from foreigners ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	17	26	[ w ] When he said , “ From foreigners , ” Jesus said to him , “ Then the subjects are exempt .
NABRE	Matthew	17	27	But that we may not offend them , [ x ] go to the sea , drop in a hook , and take the first fish that comes up . Open its mouth and you will find a coin worth twice the temple tax . Give that to them for me and for you. ” Footnotes - 17:1–8 The account of the transfiguration confirms that Jesus is the Son of God ( Mt 17:5 ) and points to fulfillment of the prediction that he will come in his Father ’ s glory at the end of the age ( Mt 16:27 ) . It has been explained by some as a resurrection appearance retrojected into the time of Jesus ’ ministry , but that is not probable since the account lacks many of the usual elements of the resurrection-appearance narratives . It draws upon motifs from the Old Testament and noncanonical Jewish apocalyptic literature that express the presence of the heavenly and the divine , e.g. , brilliant light , white garments , and the overshadowing cloud . - 17:1 These three disciples are also taken apart from the others by Jesus in Gethsemane ( Mt 26:37 ) . A high mountain : this has been identified with Tabor or Hermon , but probably no specific mountain was intended by the evangelist or by his Marcan source ( Mk 9:2 ) . Its meaning is theological rather than geographical , possibly recalling the revelation to Moses on Mount Sinai ( Ex 24:12–18 ) and to Elijah at the same place (
NABRE	Matthew	17	28	) . - 17:6–7 A Matthean addition ; cf . Dn 10:9–10 , 18–19 . - 17:9–13 In response to the disciples ’ question about the expected return of Elijah , Jesus interprets the mission of the Baptist as the fulfillment of that expectation . But that was not suspected by those who opposed and finally killed him , and Jesus predicts a similar fate for himself . - 17:9 The vision : Matthew alone uses this word to describe the transfiguration . Until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead : only in the light of Jesus ’ resurrection can the meaning of his life and mission be truly understood ; until then no testimony to the vision will lead people to faith . - 17:10 See notes on Mt 3:4 ; 16:14 . - 17:11–12 The preceding question and this answer may reflect later controversy with Jews who objected to the Christian claims for Jesus that Elijah had not yet come . - 17:13 See Mt 11:14 . - 17:14–20 Matthew has greatly shortened the Marcan story ( Mk 9:14–29 ) . Leaving aside several details of the boy ’ s illness , he concentrates on the need for faith , not so much on the part of the boy ’ s father ( as does Mark , for Matthew omits Mk 9:22b–24 ) but on that of his own disciples whose inability to drive out the demon is ascribed to their little faith ( Mt 17:20 ) . - 17:15 A lunatic : this description of the boy is peculiar to Matthew . The word occurs in the New Testament only here and in Mt 4:24 and means one affected or struck by the moon . The symptoms of the boy ’ s illness point to epilepsy , and attacks of this were thought to be caused by phases of the moon . - 17:17 Faithless and perverse : so Matthew and Luke ( Lk 9:41 ) against Mark ’ s faithless ( Mk 9:19 ) . The Greek word here translated perverse is the same as that in Dt 32:5 LXX , where Moses speaks to his people . There is a problem in knowing to whom the reproach is addressed . Since the Matthean Jesus normally chides his disciples for their little faith ( as in Mt 17:20 ) , it would appear that the charge of lack of faith could not be made against them and that the reproach is addressed to unbelievers among the Jews . However in Mt 17:20b ( if you have faith the size of a mustard seed ) , which is certainly addressed to the disciples , they appear to have not even the smallest faith ; if they had , they would have been able to cure the boy . In the light of Mt 17:20b the reproach of Mt 17:17 could have applied to the disciples . There seems to be an inconsistency between the charge of little faith in Mt 17:20a and that of not even a little in Mt 17:20b . - 17:18 The demon came out of him : not until this verse does Matthew indicate that the boy ’ s illness is a case of demoniacal possession . - 17:20 The entire verse is an addition of Matthew who ( according to the better attested text ) omits the reason given for the disciples ’ inability in Mk 9:29 . Little faith : see note on Mt 6:30 . Faith the size of a mustard seed…and it will move : a combination of a Q saying ( cf . Lk 17:6 ) with a Marcan saying ( cf . Mk 11:23 ) . - 17:21 Some manuscripts add , “ But this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting ” ; this is a variant of the better reading of Mk 9:29 . - 17:22–23 The second passion prediction ( cf . Mt 16:21–23 ) is the least detailed of the three and may be the earliest . In the Marcan parallel the disciples do not understand ( Mk 9:32 ) ; here they understand and are overwhelmed with grief at the prospect of Jesus ’ death ( Mt 17:23 ) . - 17:24–27 Like Mt 14:28–31 and Mt 16:16b–19 , this episode comes from Matthew ’ s special material on Peter . Although the question of the collectors concerns Jesus ’ payment of the temple tax , it is put to Peter . It is he who receives instruction from Jesus about freedom from the obligation of payment and yet why it should be made . The means of doing so is provided miraculously . The pericope deals with a problem of Matthew ’ s church , whether its members should pay the temple tax , and the answer is given through a word of Jesus conveyed to Peter . Some scholars see here an example of the teaching authority of Peter exercised in the name of Jesus ( see Mt 16:19 ) . The specific problem was a Jewish Christian one and may have arisen when the Matthean church was composed largely of that group . - 17:24 The temple tax : before the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in A.D.
NABRE	Matthew	17	70	every male Jew above nineteen years of age was obliged to make an annual contribution to its upkeep ( cf . Ex 30:11–16 ; Neh 10:33 ) . After the destruction the Romans imposed upon Jews the obligation of paying that tax for the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus . There is disagreement about which period the story deals with . - 17:25 From their subjects or from foreigners ? : the Greek word here translated subjects literally means “ sons. ” - 17:26 Then the subjects are exempt : just as subjects are not bound by laws applying to foreigners , neither are Jesus and his disciples , who belong to the kingdom of heaven , bound by the duty of paying the temple tax imposed on those who are not of the kingdom . If the Greek is translated “ sons , ” the freedom of Jesus , the Son of God , and of his disciples , children ( “ sons ” ) of the kingdom ( cf . Mt 13:38 ) , is even more clear . - 17:27 That we may not offend them : though they are exempt ( Mt 17:26 ) , Jesus and his disciples are to avoid giving offense ; therefore the tax is to be paid . A coin worth twice the temple tax : literally , “ a stater , ” a Greek coin worth two double drachmas . Two double drachmas were equal to the Jewish shekel and the tax was a half-shekel . For me and for you : not only Jesus but Peter pays the tax , and this example serves as a standard for the conduct of all the disciples .

NABRE	Matthew	18	18	[ o ] ( K ) Amen , I say to you , whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven , and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
NABRE	Matthew	18	1	Cor 5:1–13 . - 18:18 Except for the plural of the verbs bind and loose , this verse is practically identical with Mt 16:19b and many scholars understand it as granting to all the disciples what was previously given to Peter alone . For a different view , based on the different contexts of the two verses , see note on Mt 16:19 . - 18:19–20 Some take these verses as applying to prayer on the occasion of the church ’ s gathering to deal with the sinner of Mt 18:17 . Unless an a fortiori argument is supposed , this seems unlikely . God ’ s answer to the prayer of two or three envisages a different situation from one that involves the entire congregation . In addition , the object of this prayer is expressed in most general terms as anything for which they are to pray . - 18:20 For where two or three…midst of them : the presence of Jesus guarantees the efficacy of the prayer . This saying is similar to one attributed to a rabbi executed in A.D.
NABRE	Matthew	18	2	He called a child over , placed it in their midst ,
NABRE	Matthew	18	3	) . - 18:21–35 The final section of the discourse deals with the forgiveness that the disciples are to give to their fellow disciples who sin against them . To the question of Peter how often forgiveness is to be granted ( Mt 18:21 ) , Jesus answers that it is to be given without limit ( Mt 18:22 ) and illustrates this with the parable of the unmerciful servant ( Mt 18:23–34 ) , warning that his heavenly Father will give those who do not forgive the same treatment as that given to the unmerciful servant ( Mt 18:35 ) . Mt 18:21–22 correspond to Lk 17:4 ; the parable and the final warning are peculiar to Matthew . That the parable did not originally belong to this context is suggested by the fact that it really does not deal with repeated forgiveness , which is the point of Peter ’ s question and Jesus ’ reply . - 18:22 Seventy-seven times : the Greek corresponds exactly to the LXX of Gn 4:24 . There is probably an allusion , by contrast , to the limitless vengeance of Lamech in the Genesis text . In any case , what is demanded of the disciples is limitless forgiveness . - 18:24 A huge amount : literally , “ ten thousand talents. ” The talent was a unit of coinage of high but varying value depending on its metal ( gold , silver , copper ) and its place of origin . It is mentioned in the New Testament only here and in Mt 25:14–30 . - 18:26 Pay you back in full : an empty promise , given the size of the debt . - 18:28 A much smaller amount : literally , “ a hundred denarii. ” A denarius was the normal daily wage of a laborer . The difference between the two debts is enormous and brings out the absurdity of the conduct of the Christian who has received the great forgiveness of God and yet refuses to forgive the relatively minor offenses done to him . - 18:34 Since the debt is so great as to be unpayable , the punishment will be endless . - 18:35 The Father ’ s forgiveness , already given , will be withdrawn at the final judgment for those who have not imitated his forgiveness by their own .

NABRE	Matthew	18	14	Matthew has drawn out explicitly the application of the parable to the care of the little ones . - 18:10 Their angels in heaven…my heavenly Father : for the Jewish belief in angels as guardians of nations and individuals , see Dn 10:13 , 20–21 ; Tb 5:4–7 ; 1QH 5:20–22 ; as intercessors who present the prayers of human beings to God , see Tb 13:12 ,
NABRE	Matthew	18	15	. The high worth of the little ones is indicated by their being represented before God by these heavenly beings . - 18:11 Some manuscripts add , “ For the Son of Man has come to save what was lost ” ; cf . Mt 9:13 . This is practically identical with Lk 19:10 and is probably a copyist ’ s addition from that source . - 18:15–20 Passing from the duty of Christian disciples toward those who have strayed from their number , the discourse now turns to how they are to deal with one who sins and yet remains within the community . First there is to be private correction ( Mt 18:15 ) ; if this is unsuccessful , further correction before two or three witnesses ( Mt 18:16 ) ; if this fails , the matter is to be brought before the assembled community ( the church ) , and if the sinner refuses to attend to the correction of the church , he is to be expelled ( Mt 18:17 ) . The church ’ s judgment will be ratified in heaven , i.e. , by God ( Mt 18:18 ) . This three-step process of correction corresponds , though not exactly , to the procedure of the Qumran community ; see 1QS 5:25–6:1 ; 6:24–7:25 ; CD 9:2–8 . The section ends with a saying about the favorable response of God to prayer , even to that of a very small number , for Jesus is in the midst of any gathering of his disciples , however small ( Mt 18:19–20 ) . Whether this prayer has anything to do with the preceding judgment is uncertain . - 18:15 Your brother : a fellow disciple ; see Mt 23:8 . The bracketed words , against you , are widely attested but they are not in the important codices Sinaiticus and Vaticanus or in some other textual witnesses . Their omission broadens the type of sin in question . Won over : literally , “ gained. ” - 18:16 Cf . Dt 19:15 . - 18:17 The church : the second of the only two instances of this word in the gospels ; see note on Mt 16:18 . Here it refers not to the entire church of Jesus , as in Mt 16:18 , but to the local congregation . Treat him…a Gentile or a tax collector : just as the observant Jew avoided the company of Gentiles and tax collectors , so must the congregation of Christian disciples separate itself from the arrogantly sinful member who refuses to repent even when convicted of his sin by the whole church . Such a one is to be set outside the fellowship of the community . The harsh language about Gentile and tax collector probably reflects a stage of the Matthean church when it was principally composed of Jewish Christians . That time had long since passed , but the principle of exclusion for such a sinner remained . Paul makes a similar demand for excommunication in

NABRE	Matthew	18	21	( N ) Then Peter approaching asked him , “ Lord , if my brother sins against me , how often must I forgive him ? As many as seven times ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	18	22	[ s ] Jesus answered , “ I say to you , not seven times but seventy-seven times .
NABRE	Matthew	18	23	( O ) That is why the kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants .
NABRE	Matthew	18	24	[ t ] When he began the accounting , a debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount .
NABRE	Matthew	18	25	Since he had no way of paying it back , his master ordered him to be sold , along with his wife , his children , and all his property , in payment of the debt .
NABRE	Matthew	18	26	[ u ] At that , the servant fell down , did him homage , and said , ‘ Be patient with me , and I will pay you back in full. ’
NABRE	Matthew	18	27	Moved with compassion the master of that servant let him go and forgave him the loan .
NABRE	Matthew	18	28	When that servant had left , he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a much smaller amount . [ v ] He seized him and started to choke him , demanding , ‘ Pay back what you owe. ’
NABRE	Matthew	18	29	Falling to his knees , his fellow servant begged him , ‘ Be patient with me , and I will pay you back. ’
NABRE	Matthew	18	30	But he refused . Instead , he had him put in prison until he paid back the debt .
NABRE	Matthew	18	31	Now when his fellow servants saw what had happened , they were deeply disturbed , and went to their master and reported the whole affair .
NABRE	Matthew	18	32	His master summoned him and said to him , ‘ You wicked servant ! I forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to .
NABRE	Matthew	18	33	( P ) Should you not have had pity on your fellow servant , as I had pity on you ? ’
NABRE	Matthew	18	34	Then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers until he should pay back the whole debt . [ w ]
NABRE	Matthew	18	35	[ x ] ( Q ) So will my heavenly Father do to you , unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart. ” Footnotes - 18:1–35 This discourse of the fourth book of the gospel is often called the “ church order ” discourse , but it lacks most of the considerations usually connected with church order , such as various offices in the church and the duties of each , and deals principally with the relations that must obtain among the members of the church . Beginning with the warning that greatness in the kingdom of heaven is measured not by rank or power but by childlikeness ( Mt 18:1–5 ) , it deals with the care that the disciples must take not to cause the little ones to sin or to neglect them if they stray from the community ( Mt 18:6–14 ) , the correction of members who sin ( Mt 18:15–18 ) , the efficacy of the prayer of the disciples because of the presence of Jesus ( Mt 18:19–20 ) , and the forgiveness that must be repeatedly extended to sinful members who repent ( Mt 18:21–35 ) . - 18:1 The initiative is taken not by Jesus as in the Marcan parallel ( Mk 9:33–34 ) but by the disciples . Kingdom of heaven : this may mean the kingdom in its fullness , i.e. , after the parousia and the final judgment . But what follows about causes of sin , church discipline , and forgiveness , all dealing with the present age , suggests that the question has to do with rank also in the church , where the kingdom is manifested here and now , although only partially and by anticipation ; see notes on Mt 3:2 ; 4:17 . - 18:3 Become like children : the child is held up as a model for the disciples not because of any supposed innocence of children but because of their complete dependence on , and trust in , their parents . So must the disciples be , in respect to God . - 18:5 Cf . Mt 10:40 . - 18:6 One of these little ones : the thought passes from the child of Mt 18:2–4 to the disciples , little ones because of their becoming like children . It is difficult to know whether this is a designation of all who are disciples or of those who are insignificant in contrast to others , e.g. , the leaders of the community . Since apart from this chapter the designation little ones occurs in Matthew only in Mt 10:42 where it means disciples as such , that is its more likely meaning here . Who believe in me : since discipleship is impossible without at least some degree of faith , this further specification seems superfluous . However , it serves to indicate that the warning against causing a little one to sin is principally directed against whatever would lead such a one to a weakening or loss of faith . The Greek verb skandalizein , here translated causes…to sin , means literally “ causes to stumble ” ; what the stumbling is depends on the context . It is used of falling away from faith in Mt 13:21 . According to the better reading of Mk 9:42 , in me is a Matthean addition to the Marcan source . It would be better…depths of the sea : cf . Mk 9:42 . - 18:7 This is a Q saying ; cf . Lk 17:1 . The inevitability of things that cause sin ( literally , “ scandals ” ) does not take away the responsibility of the one through whom they come . - 18:8–9 These verses are a doublet of Mt 5:29–30 . In that context they have to do with causes of sexual sin . As in the Marcan source from which they have been drawn ( Mk 9:42–48 ) , they differ from the first warning about scandal , which deals with causing another person to sin , for they concern what causes oneself to sin and they do not seem to be related to another ’ s loss of faith , as the first warning is . It is difficult to know how Matthew understood the logical connection between these verses and Mt 18:6–7 . - 18:10–14 The first and last verses are peculiar to Matthew . The parable itself comes from Q ; see Lk 15:3–7 . In Luke it serves as justification for Jesus ’ table-companionship with sinners ; here , it is an exhortation for the disciples to seek out fellow disciples who have gone astray . Not only must no one cause a fellow disciple to sin , but those who have strayed must be sought out and , if possible , brought back to the community . The joy of the shepherd on finding the sheep , though not absent in Mt 18:13 is more emphasized in Luke . By his addition of Mt 18:10 ,

But since it is connected here with the time when the Son of Man will be seated on his throne of glory , language that Matthew uses in Mt 25:31 for the time of final judgment , it is more likely that what the Twelve are promised is that they will be joined with Jesus then in judging the people of Israel . - 19:30 Different interpretations have been given to this saying , which comes from Mk 10:31 . In view of Matthew ’ s associating it with the following parable ( Mt 20:1–15 ) and substantially repeating it ( in reverse order ) at the end of that parable ( Mt 20:16 ) , it may be that his meaning is that all who respond to the call of Jesus , at whatever time ( first or last ) , will be the same in respect to inheriting the benefits of the kingdom , which is the gift of God .

Consequently , it seems plausible to maintain that the evangelist did not intend to give it the structural importance of the five other discourses , and that , in spite of its being composed of sayings-material , it belongs to the narrative section of this book . In that regard , it is similar to the sayings-material of Mt 11:7–30 . Some have proposed that Matthew wished to regard it as part of the final discourse of Mt 24–25 , but the intervening material ( Mt 24:1–4 ) and the change in matter and style of those chapters do not support that view . - 19:1 In giving Jesus ’ teaching on divorce ( Mt 19:3–9 ) , Matthew here follows his Marcan source ( Mk 10:2–12 ) as he does Q in Mt 5:31–32 ( cf . Lk 16:18 ) . Mt 19:10–12 are peculiar to Matthew . - 19:1 When Jesus finished these words : see note on Mt 7:28–29 .

NABRE	Matthew	19	26	( L ) Jesus looked at them and said , “ For human beings this is impossible , but for God all things are possible. ”
NABRE	Matthew	19	27	( M ) Then Peter said to him in reply , “ We have given up everything and followed you . What will there be for us ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	19	28	[ s ] ( N ) Jesus said to them , “ Amen , I say to you that you who have followed me , in the new age , when the Son of Man is seated on his throne of glory , will yourselves sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
NABRE	Matthew	19	29	And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times more , and will inherit eternal life .
NABRE	Matthew	19	30	[ t ] ( O ) But many who are first will be last , and the last will be first . Footnotes - 19:1–23:39 The narrative section of the fifth book of the gospel . The first part ( Mt 19:1–20:34 ) has for its setting the journey of Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem ; the second ( Mt 21:1–23:39 ) deals with Jesus ’ ministry in Jerusalem up to the final great discourse of the gospel ( Mt 24–25 ) . Matthew follows the Marcan sequence of events , though adding material both special to this gospel and drawn from Q . The second part ends with the denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees ( Mt 23:1–36 ) followed by Jesus ’ lament over Jerusalem ( Mt 23:37–39 ) . This long and important speech raises a problem for the view that Matthew is structured around five other discourses of Jesus ( see Introduction ) and that this one has no such function in the gospel . However , it is to be noted that this speech lacks the customary concluding formula that follows the five discourses ( see note on Mt 7:28 ) , and that those discourses are all addressed either exclusively ( Mt
NABRE	Matthew	19	35	; Mk 10:2 ; 12:15 ) . For any cause whatever : this is peculiar to Matthew and has been interpreted by some as meaning that Jesus was being asked to take sides in the dispute between the schools of Hillel and Shammai on the reasons for divorce , the latter holding a stricter position than the former . It is unlikely , however , that to ask Jesus ’ opinion about the differing views of two Jewish schools , both highly respected , could be described as “ testing ” him , for the reason indicated above . - 19:4–6 Matthew recasts his Marcan source , omitting Jesus ’ question about Moses ’ command ( Mk 10:3 ) and having him recall at once two Genesis texts that show the will and purpose of the Creator in making human beings male and female ( Gn 1:27 ) , namely , that a man may be joined to his wife in marriage in the intimacy of one flesh ( Gn 2:24 ) . What God has thus joined must not be separated by any human being . ( The NAB translation of the Hebrew bāśār of Gn 2:24 as “ body ” rather than “ flesh ” obscures the reference of Matthew to that text . ) - 19:7 See Dt 24:1–4 . - 19:9 Moses ’ concession to human sinfulness ( the hardness of your hearts , Mt 19:8 ) is repudiated by Jesus , and the original will of the Creator is reaffirmed against that concession . ( Unless the marriage is unlawful ) : see note on Mt 5:31–32 . There is some evidence suggesting that Jesus ’ absolute prohibition of divorce was paralleled in the Qumran community ( see 11QTemple 57:17–19 ; CD 4:12b–5:14 ) . Matthew removes Mark ’ s setting of this verse as spoken to the disciples alone “ in the house ” ( Mk 10:10 ) and also his extension of the divorce prohibition to the case of a woman ’ s divorcing her husband ( Mk 10:12 ) , probably because in Palestine , unlike the places where Roman and Greek law prevailed , the woman was not allowed to initiate the divorce . - 19:11 [ This ] word : probably the disciples ’ “ it is better not to marry ” ( Mt 19:10 ) . Jesus agrees but says that celibacy is not for all but only for those to whom that is granted by God . - 19:12 Incapable of marriage : literally , “ eunuchs. ” Three classes are mentioned , eunuchs from birth , eunuchs by castration , and those who have voluntarily renounced marriage ( literally , “ have made themselves eunuchs ” ) for the sake of the kingdom , i.e. , to devote themselves entirely to its service . Some scholars take the last class to be those who have been divorced by their spouses and have refused to enter another marriage . But it is more likely that it is rather those who have chosen never to marry , since that suits better the optional nature of the decision : whoever can…ought to accept it . - 19:13–15 This account is understood by some as intended to justify the practice of infant baptism . That interpretation is based principally on the command not to prevent the children from coming , since that word sometimes has a baptismal connotation in the New Testament ; see Acts 8:36 . - 19:16–30 Cf . Mk 10:17–31 . This story does not set up a “ two-tier ” morality , that of those who seek ( only ) eternal life ( Mt 19:16 ) and that of those who wish to be perfect ( Mt 19:21 ) . It speaks rather of the obstacle that riches constitute for the following of Jesus and of the impossibility , humanly speaking , for one who has many possessions ( Mt 19:22 ) to enter the kingdom ( Mt 19:24 ) . Actual renunciation of riches is not demanded of all ; Matthew counts the rich Joseph of Arimathea as a disciple of Jesus ( Mt 27:57 ) . But only the poor in spirit ( Mt 5:3 ) can enter the kingdom and , as here , such poverty may entail the sacrifice of one ’ s possessions . The Twelve , who have given up everything ( Mt 19:27 ) to follow Jesus , will have as their reward a share in Jesus ’ ( the Son of Man ’ s ) judging the twelve tribes of Israel ( Mt 19:28 ) , and all who have similarly sacrificed family or property for his sake will inherit eternal life ( Mt 19:29 ) . - 19:16 Gain eternal life : this is equivalent to “ entering into life ” ( Mt 19:17 ) and “ being saved ” ( Mt 19:25 ) ; the life is that of the new age after the final judgment ( see Mt 25:46 ) . It probably is also equivalent here to “ entering the kingdom of heaven ” ( Mt 19:23 ) or “ the kingdom of God ” ( Mt 19:24 ) , but see notes on Mt 3:2 ; 4:17 ; 18:1 for the wider reference of the kingdom in Matthew . - 19:17 By Matthew ’ s reformulation of the Marcan question and reply ( Mk 10:17–18 ) Jesus ’ repudiation of the term “ good ” for himself has been softened . Yet the Marcan assertion that “ no one is good but God alone ” stands , with only unimportant verbal modification . - 19:18–19 The first five commandments cited are from the Decalogue ( see Ex 20:12–16 ; Dt 5:16–20 ) . Matthew omits Mark ’ s “ you shall not defraud ” ( Mk 10:19 ; see Dt 24:14 ) and adds Lv 19:18 . This combination of commandments of the Decalogue with Lv 19:18 is partially the same as Paul ’ s enumeration of the demands of Christian morality in Rom 13:9 . - 19:20 Young man : in Matthew alone of the synoptics the questioner is said to be a young man ; thus the Marcan “ from my youth ” ( Mk 10:20 ) is omitted . - 19:21 If you wish to be perfect : to be perfect is demanded of all Christians ; see Mt 5:48 . In the case of this man , it involves selling his possessions and giving to the poor ; only so can he follow Jesus . - 19:23–24 Riches are an obstacle to entering the kingdom that can not be overcome by human power . The comparison with the impossibility of a camel ’ s passing through the eye of a needle should not be mitigated by such suppositions as that the eye of a needle means a low or narrow gate . The kingdom of God : as in Mt 12:28 ; 21:31 ,
NABRE	Matthew	19	43	instead of Matthew ’ s usual kingdom of heaven . - 19:25–26 See note on Mk 10:23–27 . - 19:28 This saying , directed to the Twelve , is from Q ; see Lk 22:29–30 . The new age : the Greek word here translated “ new age ” occurs in the New Testament only here and in Ti 3:5 . Literally , it means “ rebirth ” or “ regeneration , ” and is used in Titus of spiritual rebirth through baptism . Here it means the “ rebirth ” effected by the coming of the kingdom . Since that coming has various stages ( see notes on Mt 3:2 ; 4:17 ) , the new age could be taken as referring to the time after the resurrection when the Twelve will govern the true Israel , i.e. , the church of Jesus . ( For “ judge ” in the sense of “ govern , ” cf . Jgs 12:8 ,

NABRE	Matthew	20	3	Going out about nine o ’ clock , he saw others standing idle in the marketplace ,

Mk 10:32–34 . This is the third and the most detailed of the passion predictions ( Mt 16:21–23 ; 17:22–23 ) .

NABRE	Matthew	20	23	He replied , “ My cup you will indeed drink , but to sit at my right and at my left [ , this ] is not mine to give but is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father. ”
NABRE	Matthew	20	24	( D ) When the ten heard this , they became indignant at the two brothers .

NABRE	Matthew	20	29	( G ) As they left Jericho , a great crowd followed him .
NABRE	Matthew	20	30	( H ) Two blind men were sitting by the roadside , and when they heard that Jesus was passing by , they cried out , “ [ Lord , ] [ m ] Son of David , have pity on us ! ”
NABRE	Matthew	20	31	The crowd warned them to be silent , but they called out all the more , “ Lord , Son of David , have pity on us ! ”
NABRE	Matthew	20	32	Jesus stopped and called them and said , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	20	33	They answered him , “ Lord , let our eyes be opened. ”
NABRE	Matthew	20	34	Moved with pity , Jesus touched their eyes . Immediately they received their sight , and followed him . Footnotes - 20:1–16 This parable is peculiar to Matthew . It is difficult to know whether the evangelist composed it or received it as part of his traditional material and , if the latter is the case , what its original reference was . In its present context its close association with Mt 19:30 suggests that its teaching is the equality of all the disciples in the reward of inheriting eternal life . - 20:4 What is just : although the wage is not stipulated as in the case of those first hired , it will be fair . - 20:8 Beginning with the last…the first : this element of the parable has no other purpose than to show how the first knew what the last were given ( Mt 20:12 ) . - 20:13 I am not cheating you : literally , “ I am not treating you unjustly. ” - 20:14–15 The owner ’ s conduct involves no violation of justice ( Mt 20:4 ,
NABRE	Matthew	20	35	) . In all but the last of these points Matthew agrees with his Marcan source , but whereas Mark speaks of Jesus ’ being killed ( Mk 10:34 ) , Matthew has the specific to be…crucified . - 20:20–28 Cf . Mk 10:35–45 . The request of the sons of Zebedee , made through their mother , for the highest places of honor in the kingdom , and the indignation of the other ten disciples at this request , show that neither the two brothers nor the others have understood that what makes for greatness in the kingdom is not lordly power but humble service . Jesus gives the example , and his ministry of service will reach its highest point when he gives his life for the deliverance of the human race from sin . - 20:20–21 The reason for Matthew ’ s making the mother the petitioner ( cf . Mk 10:35 ) is not clear . Possibly he intends an allusion to Bathsheba ’ s seeking the kingdom for Solomon ; see
NABRE	Matthew	20	76	LXX ) ; Is 43:1 ; 44:22 . The liberation brought by Jesus ’ death will be for many ; cf . Is 53:12 . Many does not mean that some are excluded , but is a Semitism designating the collectivity who benefit from the service of the one , and is equivalent to “ all. ” While there are few verbal contacts between this saying and the fourth Servant Song ( Is 52:13–53:12 ) , the ideas of that passage are reflected here . - 20:29–34 The cure of the blind men is probably symbolic of what will happen to the disciples , now blind to the meaning of Jesus ’ passion and to the necessity of their sharing his suffering . As the men are given sight , so , after the resurrection , will the disciples come to see that to which they are now blind . Matthew has abbreviated his Marcan source ( Mk 10:46–52 ) and has made Mark ’ s one man two . Such doubling is characteristic of this gospel ; see Mt 8:28–34 ( // Mk 5:1–20 ) and the note on Mt 9:27–31 . - 20:30 [ Lord , ] : some important textual witnesses omit this , but that may be because copyists assimilated this verse to Mt 9:27 .

NABRE	Matthew	21	4	[ d ] This happened so that what had been spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled :
NABRE	Matthew	21	5	( B ) “ Say to daughter Zion , ‘ Behold , your king comes to you , meek and riding on an ass , and on a colt , the foal of a beast of burden. ’ ”
NABRE	Matthew	21	6	The disciples went and did as Jesus had ordered them .

The Mount of Olives : the hill east of Jerusalem that is spoken of in Zec 14:4 as the place where the Lord will come to rescue Jerusalem from the enemy nations . - 21:2 An ass tethered , and a colt with her : instead of the one animal of Mk 11:2 , Matthew has two , as demanded by his understanding of Zec 9:9 . - 21:4–5 The prophet : this fulfillment citation is actually composed of two distinct Old Testament texts , Is 62:11 ( Say to daughter Zion ) and Zec 9:9 . The ass and the colt are the same animal in the prophecy , mentioned twice in different ways , the common Hebrew literary device of poetic parallelism . That Matthew takes them as two is one of the reasons why some scholars think that he was a Gentile rather than a Jewish Christian who would presumably not make that mistake ( see Introduction ) . - 21:7 Upon them : upon the two animals ; an awkward picture resulting from Matthew ’ s misunderstanding of the prophecy . - 21:8 Spread…on the road : cf .
NABRE	Matthew	21	12	,
NABRE	Matthew	21	13	( G ) And he said to them , “ It is written : ‘ My house shall be a house of prayer , ’ [ l ] but you are making it a den of thieves. ”
NABRE	Matthew	21	14	( H ) The blind and the lame [ m ] approached him in the temple area , and he cured them .
NABRE	Matthew	21	15	) and places the cleansing of the temple on the same day as the entry into Jerusalem , immediately after it . The activities going on in the temple area were not secular but connected with the temple worship . Thus Jesus ’ attack on those so engaged and his charge that they were making God ’ s house of prayer a den of thieves ( Mt 21:12–13 ) constituted a claim to authority over the religious practices of Israel and were a challenge to the priestly authorities . Mt 21:14–17 are peculiar to Matthew . Jesus ’ healings and his countenancing the children ’ s cries of praise rouse the indignation of the chief priests and the scribes ( Mt 21:15 ) . These two groups appear in the infancy narrative ( Mt 2:4 ) and have been mentioned in the first and third passion predictions ( Mt 16:21 ; 20:18 ) . Now , as the passion approaches , they come on the scene again , exhibiting their hostility to Jesus . - 21:12 These activities were carried on in the court of the Gentiles , the outermost court of the temple area . Animals for sacrifice were sold ; the doves were for those who could not afford a more expensive offering ; see Lv 5:7 . Tables of the money changers : only the coinage of Tyre could be used for the purchases ; other money had to be exchanged for that . - 21:13 ‘ My house…prayer ’ : cf . Is 56:7 . Matthew omits the final words of the quotation , “ for all peoples ” ( “ all nations ” ) , possibly because for him the worship of the God of Israel by all nations belongs to the time after the resurrection ; see Mt 28:19 . A den of thieves : the phrase is taken from Jer 7:11 . - 21:14 The blind and the lame : according to
NABRE	Matthew	21	16	[ o ] ( I ) and said to him , “ Do you hear what they are saying ? ” Jesus said to them , “ Yes ; and have you never read the text , ‘ Out of the mouths of infants and nurslings you have brought forth praise ’ ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	21	17	And leaving them , he went out of the city to Bethany , and there he spent the night . The Cursing of the Fig Tree . [ p ]
NABRE	Matthew	21	18	( J ) When he was going back to the city in the morning , he was hungry .
NABRE	Matthew	21	19	( K ) Seeing a fig tree by the road , he went over to it , but found nothing on it except leaves . And he said to it , “ May no fruit ever come from you again. ” And immediately the fig tree withered .
NABRE	Matthew	21	20	. By making it so , Matthew has heightened the miracle . Jesus ’ act seems arbitrary and ill-tempered , but it is a prophetic action similar to those of Old Testament prophets that vividly symbolize some part of their preaching ; see , e.g. , Ez 12:1–20 . It is a sign of the judgment that is to come upon the Israel that with all its apparent piety lacks the fruit of good deeds ( Mt 3:10 ) and will soon bear the punishment of its fruitlessness ( Mt 21:43 ) . Some scholars propose that this story is the development in tradition of a parable of Jesus about the destiny of a fruitless tree , such as Lk 13:6–9 . Jesus ’ answer to the question of the amazed disciples ( Mt 21:20 ) makes the miracle an example of the power of prayer made with unwavering faith ( Mt 21:21–22 ) . - 21:21 See Mt 17:20 . - 21:23–27 Cf . Mk 11:27–33 . This is the first of five controversies between Jesus and the religious authorities of Judaism in Mt 21:23–22:46 , presented in the form of questions and answers . - 21:23 These things : probably his entry into the city , his cleansing of the temple , and his healings there . - 21:24 To reply by counterquestion was common in rabbinical debate . - 21:26 We fear…as a prophet : cf . Mt 14:5 . - 21:27 Since through embarrassment on the one hand and fear on the other the religious authorities claim ignorance of the origin of John ’ s baptism , they show themselves incapable of speaking with authority ; hence Jesus refuses to discuss with them the grounds of his authority . - 21:28–32 The series of controversies is interrupted by three parables on the judgment of Israel ( Mt 21:28–22:14 ) of which this , peculiar to Matthew , is the first . The second ( Mt 21:33–46 ) comes from Mark ( 12:1–12 ) , and the third ( Mt 22:1–14 ) from Q ; see Lk 14:15–24 . This interruption of the controversies is similar to that in Mark , although Mark has only one parable between the first and second controversy . As regards Matthew ’ s first parable , Mt 21:28–30 if taken by themselves could point simply to the difference between saying and doing , a theme of much importance in this gospel ( cf . Mt 7:21 ; 12:50 ) ; that may have been the parable ’ s original reference . However , it is given a more specific application by the addition of Mt 21:31–32 . The two sons represent , respectively , the religious leaders and the religious outcasts who followed John ’ s call to repentance . By the answer they give to Jesus ’ question ( Mt 21:31 ) the leaders condemn themselves . There is much confusion in the textual tradition of the parable . Of the three different forms of the text given by important textual witnesses , one has the leaders answer that the son who agreed to go but did not was the one who did the father ’ s will . Although some scholars accept that as the original reading , their arguments in favor of it seem unconvincing . The choice probably lies only between a reading that puts the son who agrees and then disobeys before the son who at first refuses and then obeys , and the reading followed in the present translation . The witnesses to the latter reading are slightly better than those that support the other . - 21:31 Entering…before you : this probably means “ they enter ; you do not. ” - 21:32 Cf . Lk 7:29–30 . Although the thought is similar to that of the Lucan text , the formulation is so different that it is improbable that the saying comes from Q . Came to you…way of righteousness : several meanings are possible : that John himself was righteous , that he taught righteousness to others , or that he had an important place in God ’ s plan of salvation . For the last , see note on Mt 3:14–15 . - 21:33–46 Cf . Mk 12:1–12 . In this parable there is a close correspondence between most of the details of the story and the situation that it illustrates , the dealings of God with his people . Because of that heavy allegorizing , some scholars think that it does not in any way go back to Jesus , but represents the theology of the later church . That judgment applies to the Marcan parallel as well , although the allegorizing has gone farther in Matthew . There are others who believe that while many of the allegorical elements are due to church sources , they have been added to a basic parable spoken by Jesus .

NABRE	Matthew	21	23	( N ) When he had come into the temple area , the chief priests and the elders of the people approached him as he was teaching and said , “ By what authority are you doing these things ? [ s ] And who gave you this authority ? ” ( O )
NABRE	Matthew	21	24	Jesus said to them in reply , “ I shall ask you one question , [ t ] and if you answer it for me , then I shall tell you by what authority I do these things .
NABRE	Matthew	21	25	Where was John ’ s baptism from ? Was it of heavenly or of human origin ? ” They discussed this among themselves and said , “ If we say ‘ Of heavenly origin , ’ he will say to us , ‘ Then why did you not believe him ? ’
NABRE	Matthew	21	26	[ u ] ( P ) But if we say , ‘ Of human origin , ’ we fear the crowd , for they all regard John as a prophet. ”
NABRE	Matthew	21	27	So they said to Jesus in reply , “ We do not know. ” He himself said to them , “ Neither shall I tell you by what authority I do these things . [ v ] The Parable of the Two Sons . [ w ]
NABRE	Matthew	21	28	“ What is your opinion ? A man had two sons . He came to the first and said , ‘ Son , go out and work in the vineyard today. ’
NABRE	Matthew	21	29	He said in reply , ‘ I will not , ’ but afterwards he changed his mind and went .
NABRE	Matthew	21	30	The man came to the other son and gave the same order . He said in reply , ‘ Yes , sir , ’ but did not go .
NABRE	Matthew	21	31	[ x ] Which of the two did his father ’ s will ? ” They answered , “ The first. ” Jesus said to them , “ Amen , I say to you , tax collectors and prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God before you .
NABRE	Matthew	21	32	[ y ] ( Q ) When John came to you in the way of righteousness , you did not believe him ; but tax collectors and prostitutes did . Yet even when you saw that , you did not later change your minds and believe him . The Parable of the Tenants . [ z ]
NABRE	Matthew	21	33	( R ) “ Hear another parable . There was a landowner who planted a vineyard , [ aa ] put a hedge around it , dug a wine press in it , and built a tower . Then he leased it to tenants and went on a journey . ( S )
NABRE	Matthew	21	34	When vintage time drew near , he sent his servants [ ab ] to the tenants to obtain his produce .
NABRE	Matthew	21	35	But the tenants seized the servants and one they beat , another they killed , and a third they stoned .
NABRE	Matthew	21	36	Again he sent other servants , more numerous than the first ones , but they treated them in the same way .
NABRE	Matthew	21	37	Finally , he sent his son to them , thinking , ‘ They will respect my son. ’
NABRE	Matthew	21	38	[ ac ] But when the tenants saw the son , they said to one another , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him and acquire his inheritance. ’
NABRE	Matthew	21	39	[ ad ] ( T ) They seized him , threw him out of the vineyard , and killed him .
NABRE	Matthew	21	40	What will the owner of the vineyard do to those tenants when he comes ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	21	41	They answered [ ae ] him , “ He will put those wretched men to a wretched death and lease his vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the proper times. ”
NABRE	Matthew	21	42	[ af ] ( U ) Jesus said to them , “ Did you never read in the scriptures : ‘ The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ; by the Lord has this been done , and it is wonderful in our eyes ’ ?
NABRE	Matthew	21	43	[ ag ] Therefore , I say to you , the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that will produce its fruit .
NABRE	Matthew	21	44	[ [ ah ] The one who falls on this stone will be dashed to pieces ; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls . ] ”
NABRE	Matthew	21	45	When the chief priests and the Pharisees [ ai ] heard his parables , they knew that he was speaking about them .
NABRE	Matthew	21	46	And although they were attempting to arrest him , they feared the crowds , for they regarded him as a prophet . Footnotes - 21:1–11 Jesus ’ coming to Jerusalem is in accordance with the divine will that he must go there ( cf . Mt 16:21 ) to suffer , die , and be raised . He prepares for his entry into the city in such a way as to make it a fulfillment of the prophecy of Zec 9:9 ( Mt 21:2 ) that emphasizes the humility of the king who comes ( Mt 21:5 ) . That prophecy , absent from the Marcan parallel account ( Mk 11:1–11 ) although found also in the Johannine account of the entry ( Jn 12:15 ) , is the center of the Matthean story . During the procession from Bethphage to Jerusalem , Jesus is acclaimed as the Davidic messianic king by the crowds who accompany him ( Mt 21:9 ) . On his arrival the whole city was shaken , and to the inquiry of the amazed populace about Jesus ’ identity the crowds with him reply that he is the prophet , from Nazareth in Galilee ( Mt 21:10 ,
NABRE	Matthew	21	65	, where a less allegorized and probably more primitive form of the parable is found . - 21:33 Planted a vineyard…a tower : cf . Is 5:1–2 . The vineyard is defined in Is 5:7 as “ the house of Israel. ” - 21:34–35 His servants : Matthew has two sendings of servants as against Mark ’ s three sendings of a single servant ( Mk 12:2–5a ) followed by a statement about the sending of “ many others ” ( Mk 12:2 , 5b ) . That these servants stand for the prophets sent by God to Israel is clearly implied but not made explicit here , but see Mt 23:37 . His produce : cf . Mk 12:2 “ some of the produce. ” The produce is the good works demanded by God , and his claim to them is total . - 21:38 Acquire his inheritance : if a Jewish proselyte died without heir , the tenants of his land would have final claim on it . - 21:39 Threw him out…and killed him : the change in the Marcan order where the son is killed and his corpse then thrown out ( Mk 12:8 ) was probably made because of the tradition that Jesus died outside the city of Jerusalem ; see Jn 19:17 ; Hb 13:12 . - 21:41 They answered : in Mk 12:9 the question is answered by Jesus himself ; here the leaders answer and so condemn themselves ; cf . Mt 21:31 . Matthew adds that the new tenants to whom the vineyard will be transferred will give the owner the produce at the proper times . - 21:42 Cf . Ps 118:22–23 . The psalm was used in the early church as a prophecy of Jesus ’ resurrection ; see Acts 4:11 ;

NABRE	Matthew	22	22	When they heard this they were amazed , and leaving him they went away . The Question About the Resurrection . [ n ]
NABRE	Matthew	22	1	( A ) Jesus again in reply spoke to them in parables , saying ,
NABRE	Matthew	22	2	“ The kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who gave a wedding feast [ b ] for his son .
NABRE	Matthew	22	3	[ c ] He dispatched his servants to summon the invited guests to the feast , but they refused to come .
NABRE	Matthew	22	4	) , the murder of the servants ( Mt 22:6 ) , the punishment of the murderers ( Mt 22:7 ) , and the entrance of a new group into a privileged situation of which the others had proved themselves unworthy ( Mt 22:8–10 ) . The parable ends with a section that is peculiar to Matthew ( Mt 22:11–14 ) , which some take as a distinct parable . Matthew presents the kingdom in its double aspect , already present and something that can be entered here and now ( Mt 22:1–10 ) , and something that will be possessed only by those present members who can stand the scrutiny of the final judgment ( Mt 22:11–14 ) . The parable is not only a statement of God ’ s judgment on Israel but a warning to Matthew ’ s church . - 22:2 Wedding feast : the Old Testament ’ s portrayal of final salvation under the image of a banquet ( Is 25:6 ) is taken up also in Mt 8:11 ; cf . Lk 13:15 . - 22:3–4 Servants…other servants : probably Christian missionaries in both instances ; cf . Mt 23:34 . - 22:7 See note on Mt 22:1–14 . - 22:10 Bad and good alike : cf . Mt 13:47 . - 22:11 A wedding garment : the repentance , change of heart and mind , that is the condition for entrance into the kingdom ( Mt 3:2 ; 4:17 ) must be continued in a life of good deeds ( Mt 7:21–23 ) . - 22:13 Wailing and grinding of teeth : the Christian who lacks the wedding garment of good deeds will suffer the same fate as those Jews who have rejected Jesus ; see note on Mt 8:11–12 . - 22:15–22 The series of controversies between Jesus and the representatives of Judaism ( see note on Mt 21:23–27 ) is resumed . As in the first ( Mt 21:23–27 ) , here and in the following disputes Matthew follows his Marcan source with few modifications . - 22:15 The Pharisees : while Matthew retains the Marcan union of Pharisees and Herodians in this account , he clearly emphasizes the Pharisees ’ part . They alone are mentioned here , and the Herodians are joined with them only in a prepositional phrase of Mt 22:16 . Entrap him in speech : the question that they will pose is intended to force Jesus to take either a position contrary to that held by the majority of the people or one that will bring him into conflict with the Roman authorities . - 22:16 Herodians : see note on Mk 3:6 . They would favor payment of the tax ; the Pharisees did not . - 22:17 Is it lawful : the law to which they refer is the law of God . - 22:19 They handed him the Roman coin : their readiness in producing the money implies their use of it and their acceptance of the financial advantages of the Roman administration in Palestine . - 22:21 Caesar ’ s : the emperor Tiberius ( A.D. 14–37 ) . Repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar : those who willingly use the coin that is Caesar ’ s should repay him in kind . The answer avoids taking sides in the question of the lawfulness of the tax . To God what belongs to God : Jesus raises the debate to a new level . Those who have hypocritically asked about tax in respect to its relation to the law of God should be concerned rather with repaying God with the good deeds that are his due ; cf . Mt 21:41 ,
NABRE	Matthew	22	5	Some ignored the invitation and went away , one to his farm , another to his business .
NABRE	Matthew	22	6	( B ) The rest laid hold of his servants , mistreated them , and killed them .
NABRE	Matthew	22	7	[ d ] The king was enraged and sent his troops , destroyed those murderers , and burned their city .
NABRE	Matthew	22	8	Then he said to his servants , ‘ The feast is ready , but those who were invited were not worthy to come .
NABRE	Matthew	22	9	Go out , therefore , into the main roads and invite to the feast whomever you find. ’
NABRE	Matthew	22	10	The servants went out into the streets and gathered all they found , bad and good alike , [ e ] and the hall was filled with guests .
NABRE	Matthew	22	11	[ f ] But when the king came in to meet the guests he saw a man there not dressed in a wedding garment .
NABRE	Matthew	22	12	He said to him , ‘ My friend , how is it that you came in here without a wedding garment ? ’ But he was reduced to silence .
NABRE	Matthew	22	13	[ g ] ( C ) Then the king said to his attendants , ‘ Bind his hands and feet , and cast him into the darkness outside , where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth. ’
NABRE	Matthew	22	14	Many are invited , but few are chosen. ” Paying Taxes to the Emperor . [ h ]
NABRE	Matthew	22	15	( D ) Then the Pharisees [ i ] went off and plotted how they might entrap him in speech .
NABRE	Matthew	22	16	They sent their disciples to him , with the Herodians , [ j ] saying , “ Teacher , we know that you are a truthful man and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth . And you are not concerned with anyone ’ s opinion , for you do not regard a person ’ s status .
NABRE	Matthew	22	17	[ k ] Tell us , then , what is your opinion : Is it lawful to pay the census tax to Caesar or not ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	22	18	) the Sadducees are correctly defined as those “ who say there is no resurrection ” ; see also Lk 20:27 . Matthew ’ s rewording of Mark can mean that these particular Sadducees deny the resurrection , which would imply that he was not aware that the denial was characteristic of the party . For some scholars this is an indication of his being a Gentile Christian ; see note on Mt 21:4–5 . - 22:24 ‘ If a man dies…his brother ’ : this is known as the “ law of the levirate , ” from the Latin levir , “ brother-in-law. ” Its purpose was to continue the family line of the deceased brother ( Dt 25:6 ) . - 22:29 The sexual relationships of this world will be transcended ; the risen body will be the work of the creative power of God . - 22:31–32 Cf . Ex 3:6 . In the Pentateuch , which the Sadducees accepted as normative for Jewish belief and practice , God speaks even now ( to you ) of himself as the God of the patriarchs who died centuries ago . He identifies himself in relation to them , and because of their relation to him , the living God , they too are alive . This might appear no argument for the resurrection , but simply for life after death as conceived in Wis 3:1–3 . But the general thought of early first-century Judaism was not influenced by that conception ; for it human immortality was connected with the existence of the body . - 22:34–40 The Marcan parallel ( Mk 12:28–34 ) is an exchange between Jesus and a scribe who is impressed by the way in which Jesus has conducted himself in the previous controversy ( Mk 12:28 ) , who compliments him for the answer he gives him ( Mk 12:32 ) , and who is said by Jesus to be “ not far from the kingdom of God ” ( Mk 12:34 ) . Matthew has sharpened that scene . The questioner , as the representative of other Pharisees , tests Jesus by his question ( Mt 22:34–35 ) , and both his reaction to Jesus ’ reply and Jesus ’ commendation of him are lacking . - 22:35 [ A scholar of the law ] : meaning “ scribe. ” Although this reading is supported by the vast majority of textual witnesses , it is the only time that the Greek word so translated occurs in Matthew . It is relatively frequent in Luke , and there is reason to think that it may have been added here by a copyist since it occurs in the Lucan parallel ( Lk 10:25–28 ) . Tested : see note on Mt 19:3 . - 22:36 For the devout Jew all the commandments were to be kept with equal care , but there is evidence of preoccupation in Jewish sources with the question put to Jesus . - 22:37–38 Cf . Dt 6:5 . Matthew omits the first part of Mark ’ s fuller quotation ( Mk 12:29 ; Dt 6:4–5 ) , probably because he considered its monotheistic emphasis needless for his church . The love of God must engage the total person ( heart , soul , mind ) . - 22:39 Jesus goes beyond the extent of the question put to him and joins to the greatest and the first commandment a second , that of love of neighbor , Lv 19:18 ; see note on Mt 19:18–19 . This combination of the two commandments may already have been made in Judaism . - 22:40 The double commandment is the source from which the whole law and the prophets are derived . - 22:41–46 Having answered the questions of his opponents in the preceding three controversies , Jesus now puts a question to them about the sonship of the Messiah . Their easy response ( Mt 22:43a ) is countered by his quoting a verse of Ps
NABRE	Matthew	22	19	[ l ] Show me the coin that pays the census tax. ” Then they handed him the Roman coin .
NABRE	Matthew	22	20	He said to them , “ Whose image is this and whose inscription ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	22	21	( E ) They replied , “ Caesar ’ s. ” [ m ] At that he said to them , “ Then repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God. ”
NABRE	Matthew	22	23	( F ) On that day Sadducees approached him , saying that there is no resurrection . [ o ] They put this question to him ,
NABRE	Matthew	22	24	( G ) saying , “ Teacher , Moses said , ‘ If a man dies [ p ] without children , his brother shall marry his wife and raise up descendants for his brother. ’
NABRE	Matthew	22	25	Now there were seven brothers among us . The first married and died and , having no descendants , left his wife to his brother .
NABRE	Matthew	22	26	The same happened with the second and the third , through all seven .
NABRE	Matthew	22	27	Finally the woman died .
NABRE	Matthew	22	28	Now at the resurrection , of the seven , whose wife will she be ? For they all had been married to her. ”
NABRE	Matthew	22	29	[ q ] Jesus said to them in reply , “ You are misled because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God .
NABRE	Matthew	22	30	At the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like the angels in heaven .
NABRE	Matthew	22	31	And concerning the resurrection of the dead , have you not read what was said to you [ r ] by God ,
NABRE	Matthew	22	32	( H ) ‘ I am the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ’ ? He is not the God of the dead but of the living. ”
NABRE	Matthew	22	33	When the crowds heard this , they were astonished at his teaching . The Greatest Commandment . [ s ]
NABRE	Matthew	22	34	( I ) When the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees , they gathered together ,
NABRE	Matthew	22	35	and one of them [ a scholar of the law ] [ t ] tested him by asking ,
NABRE	Matthew	22	36	“ Teacher , [ u ] which commandment in the law is the greatest ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	22	37	( J ) He said to him , [ v ] “ You shall love the Lord , your God , with all your heart , with all your soul , and with all your mind .
NABRE	Matthew	22	38	This is the greatest and the first commandment .
NABRE	Matthew	22	39	( K ) The second is like it : [ w ] You shall love your neighbor as yourself .
NABRE	Matthew	22	40	[ x ] ( L ) The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments. ” The Question About David ’ s Son . [ y ]
NABRE	Matthew	22	41	( M ) While the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus questioned them , [ z ]
NABRE	Matthew	22	42	[ aa ] saying , “ What is your opinion about the Messiah ? Whose son is he ? ” They replied , “ David ’ s. ”
NABRE	Matthew	22	43	. - 22:23–33 Here Jesus ’ opponents are the Sadducees , members of the powerful priestly party of his time ; see note on Mt 3:7 . Denying the resurrection of the dead , a teaching of relatively late origin in Judaism ( cf . Dn 12:2 ) , they appeal to a law of the Pentateuch ( Dt 25:5–10 ) and present a case based on it that would make resurrection from the dead ridiculous ( Mt 22:24–28 ) . Jesus chides them for knowing neither the scriptures nor the power of God ( Mt 22:29 ) . His argument in respect to God ’ s power contradicts the notion , held even by many proponents as well as by opponents of the teaching , that the life of those raised from the dead would be essentially a continuation of the type of life they had had before death ( Mt 22:30 ) . His argument based on the scriptures ( Mt 22:31–32 ) is of a sort that was accepted as valid among Jews of the time . - 22:23 Saying that there is no resurrection : in the Marcan parallel ( Mk 22:12 ,
NABRE	Matthew	22	44	( N ) ‘ The Lord said to my lord , “ Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies under your feet ” ’ ?
NABRE	Matthew	22	45	[ ab ] If David calls him ‘ lord , ’ how can he be his son ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	22	46	( O ) No one was able to answer him a word , nor from that day on did anyone dare to ask him any more questions . Footnotes - 22:1–14 This parable is from Q ; see Lk 14:15–24 . It has been given many allegorical traits by Matthew , e.g. , the burning of the city of the guests who refused the invitation ( Mt 22:7 ) , which corresponds to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in A.D.
NABRE	Matthew	22	70	. It has similarities with the preceding parable of the tenants : the sending of two groups of servants ( Mt 22:3 ,
NABRE	Matthew	22	110	that raises a problem for their response ( 43b–45 ) . They are unable to solve it and from that day on their questioning of him is ended . - 22:41 The Pharisees…questioned them : Mark is not specific about who are questioned ( Mk 12:35 ) . - 22:42–44 David ’ s : this view of the Pharisees was based on such Old Testament texts as Is 11:1–9 ; Jer 23:5 ; and Ez 34:23 ; see also the extrabiblical Psalms of Solomon 17:21 . How , then…saying : Jesus cites Ps 110:1 accepting the Davidic authorship of the psalm , a common view of his time . The psalm was probably composed for the enthronement of a Davidic king of Judah . Matthew assumes that the Pharisees interpret it as referring to the Messiah , although there is no clear evidence that it was so interpreted in the Judaism of Jesus ’ time . It was widely used in the early church as referring to the exaltation of the risen Jesus . My lord : understood as the Messiah . - 22:45 Since Matthew presents Jesus both as Messiah ( Mt 16:16 ) and as Son of David ( Mt 1:1 ; see also note on Mt 9:27 ) , the question is not meant to imply Jesus ’ denial of Davidic sonship . It probably means that although he is the Son of David , he is someone greater , Son of Man and Son of God , and recognized as greater by David who calls him my ‘ lord. ’ Scripture texts , prefaces , introductions , footnotes and cross references used in this work are taken from the New American Bible , revised edition ©

NABRE	Matthew	23	23	and the note on Mt 10:17 . All the righteous blood shed upon the earth : the slaying of the disciples is in continuity with all the shedding of righteous blood beginning with that of Abel . The persecution of Jesus ’ disciples by this generation involves the persecutors in the guilt of their murderous ancestors . The blood of Zechariah : see note on Lk 11:51 . By identifying him as the son of Barachiah Matthew understands him to be Zechariah the Old Testament minor prophet ; see Zec 1:1 . - 23:37–39 Cf . Lk 13:34–35 . The denunciation of Pharisaic Judaism ends with this lament over Jerusalem , which has repeatedly rejected and murdered those whom God has sent to her . How many times : this may refer to various visits of Jesus to the city , an aspect of his ministry found in John but otherwise not in the synoptics . As a hen…under her wings : for imagery similar to this , see Ps 17:8 ; 91:4 . Your house…desolate : probably an allusion to the destruction of the temple in A.D.
NABRE	Matthew	23	1	( A ) Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples ,
NABRE	Matthew	23	2	[ b ] saying , “ The scribes and the Pharisees have taken their seat on the chair of Moses .
NABRE	Matthew	23	3	Therefore , do and observe all things whatsoever they tell you , but do not follow their example . For they preach but they do not practice .
NABRE	Matthew	23	4	( B ) They tie up heavy burdens [ c ] [ hard to carry ] and lay them on people ’ s shoulders , but they will not lift a finger to move them .
NABRE	Matthew	23	5	[ d ] ( C ) All their works are performed to be seen . They widen their phylacteries and lengthen their tassels .
NABRE	Matthew	23	6	[ e ] ( D ) They love places of honor at banquets , seats of honor in synagogues ,
NABRE	Matthew	23	7	greetings in marketplaces , and the salutation ‘ Rabbi. ’
NABRE	Matthew	23	8	[ f ] As for you , do not be called ‘ Rabbi. ’ You have but one teacher , and you are all brothers .
NABRE	Matthew	23	9	Call no one on earth your father ; you have but one Father in heaven .
NABRE	Matthew	23	10	Do not be called ‘ Master ’ ; you have but one master , the Messiah .

NABRE	Matthew	23	12	( F ) Whoever exalts himself will be humbled ; but whoever humbles himself will be exalted .
NABRE	Matthew	23	13	[ g ] ( G ) “ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , you hypocrites . You lock the kingdom of heaven [ h ] before human beings . You do not enter yourselves , nor do you allow entrance to those trying to enter . [
NABRE	Matthew	23	14	] [ i ]
NABRE	Matthew	23	15	[ j ] “ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , you hypocrites . You traverse sea and land to make one convert , and when that happens you make him a child of Gehenna twice as much as yourselves .
NABRE	Matthew	23	16	; Dt 6:8 ; 11:18 ) . Tassels : see note on Mt 9:20 . The widening of phylacteries and the lengthening of tassels were for the purpose of making these evidences of piety more noticeable . - 23:6–7 Cf . Mk 12:38–39 . ‘ Rabbi ’ : literally , “ my great one , ” a title of respect for teachers and leaders . - 23:8–12 These verses , warning against the use of various titles , are addressed to the disciples alone . While only the title ‘ Rabbi ’ has been said to be used in addressing the scribes and Pharisees ( Mt 23:7 ) , the implication is that Father and ‘ Master ’ also were . The prohibition of these titles to the disciples suggests that their use was present in Matthew ’ s church . The Matthean Jesus forbids not only the titles but the spirit of superiority and pride that is shown by their acceptance . Whoever exalts…will be exalted : cf . Lk 14:11 . - 23:13–36 This series of seven “ woes , ” directed against the scribes and Pharisees and addressed to them , is the heart of the speech . The phrase woe to occurs often in the prophetic and apocalyptic literature , expressing horror of a sin and punishment for those who commit it . Hypocrites : see note on Mt 6:2 . The hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees consists in the difference between their speech and action ( Mt 23:3 ) and in demonstrations of piety that have no other purpose than to enhance their reputation as religious persons ( Mt 23:5 ) . - 23:13 You lock the kingdom of heaven : cf . Mt 16:19 where Jesus tells Peter that he will give him the keys to the kingdom of heaven . The purpose of the authority expressed by that metaphor is to give entrance into the kingdom ( the kingdom is closed only to those who reject the authority ) ; here the charge is made that the authority of the scribes and Pharisees is exercised in such a way as to be an obstacle to entrance . Cf . Lk 11:52 where the accusation against the “ scholars of the law ” ( Matthew ’ s scribes ) is that they “ have taken away the key of knowledge. ” - 23:14 Some manuscripts add a verse here or after Mt 23:12 , “ Woe to you , scribes and Pharisees , you hypocrites . You devour the houses of widows and , as a pretext , recite lengthy prayers . Because of this , you will receive a very severe condemnation. ” Cf . Mk 12:40 ; Lk 20:47 . This “ woe ” is almost identical with Mk 12:40 and seems to be an interpolation derived from that text . - 23:15 In the first century A.D. until the First Jewish Revolt against Rome ( A.D. 66–70 ) , many Pharisees conducted a vigorous missionary campaign among Gentiles . Convert : literally , “ proselyte , ” a Gentile who accepted Judaism fully by submitting to circumcision and all other requirements of Mosaic law . Child of Gehenna : worthy of everlasting punishment ; for Gehenna , see note on Mt 5:22 . Twice as much as yourselves : possibly this refers simply to the zeal of the convert , surpassing that of the one who converted him . - 23:16–22 An attack on the casuistry that declared some oaths binding ( one is obligated ) and others not ( it means nothing ) and held the binding oath to be the one made by something of lesser value ( the gold ; the gift on the altar ) . Such teaching , which inverts the order of values , reveals the teachers to be blind guides ; cf . Mt 15:14 . Since the Matthean Jesus forbids all oaths to his disciples ( Mt 5:33–37 ) , this woe does not set up a standard for Christian moral conduct , but ridicules the Pharisees on their own terms . - 23:23 The Mosaic law ordered tithing of the produce of the land ( Lv 27:30 ; Dt 14:22–23 ) , and the scribal tradition is said here to have extended this law to even the smallest herbs . The practice is criticized not in itself but because it shows the Pharisees ’ preoccupation with matters of less importance while they neglect the weightier things of the law . - 23:24 Cf . Lv 11:41–45 that forbids the eating of any “ swarming creature. ” The Pharisees ’ scrupulosity about minor matters and neglect of greater ones ( Mt 23:23 ) is further brought out by this contrast between straining liquids that might contain a tiny “ swarming creature ” and yet swallowing the camel . The latter was one of the unclean animals forbidden by the law ( Lv 11:4 ) , but it is hardly possible that the scribes and Pharisees are being denounced as guilty of so gross a violation of the food laws . To swallow the camel is only a hyperbolic way of speaking of their neglect of what is important . - 23:25–26 The ritual washing of utensils for dining ( cf . Mk 7:4 ) is turned into a metaphor illustrating a concern for appearances while inner purity is ignored . The scribes and Pharisees are compared to cups carefully washed on the outside but filthy within . Self-indulgence : the Greek word here translated means lack of self-control , whether in drinking or in sexual conduct . - 23:27–28 The sixth woe , like the preceding one , deals with concern for externals and neglect of what is inside . Since contact with dead bodies , even when one was unaware of it , caused ritual impurity ( Nm 19:11–22 ) , tombs were whitewashed so that no one would contract such impurity inadvertently . - 23:29–36 The final woe is the most serious indictment of all . It portrays the scribes and Pharisees as standing in the same line as their ancestors who murdered the prophets and the righteous . - 23:29–32 In spite of honoring the slain dead by building their tombs and adorning their memorials , and claiming that they would not have joined in their ancestors ’ crimes if they had lived in their days , the scribes and Pharisees are true children of their ancestors and are defiantly ordered by Jesus to fill up what those ancestors measured out . This order reflects the Jewish notion that there was an allotted measure of suffering that had to be completed before God ’ s final judgment would take place . - 23:34–36 There are important differences between the Matthean and the Lucan form of this Q material ; cf . Lk 11:49–51 . In Luke the one who sends the emissaries is the “ wisdom of God. ” If , as many scholars think , that is the original wording of Q , Matthew , by making Jesus the sender , has presented him as the personified divine wisdom . In Luke , wisdom ’ s emissaries are the Old Testament “ prophets ” and the Christian “ apostles. ” Matthew ’ s prophets and wise men and scribes are probably Christian disciples alone ; cf . Mt 10:41 and see note on Mt 13:52 . You will kill : see Mt 24:9 . Scourge in your synagogues…town to town : see Mt 10:17 ,

NABRE	Matthew	23	20	( I ) One who swears by the altar swears by it and all that is upon it ;

NABRE	Matthew	23	39	( U ) I tell you , you will not see me again until you say , ‘ Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. ’ ” Footnotes - 23:1–39 The final section of the narrative part of the fifth book of the gospel is a denunciation by Jesus of the scribes and the Pharisees ( see note on Mt 3:7 ) . It depends in part on Mark and Q ( cf . Mk 12:38–39 ; Lk 11:37–52 ; 13:34–35 ) , but in the main it is peculiar to Matthew . ( For the reasons against considering this extensive body of sayings-material either as one of the structural discourses of this gospel or as part of the one that follows in Mt 24–25 , see note on Mt 19:1–23:39 . ) While the tradition of a deep opposition between Jesus and the Pharisees is well founded , this speech reflects an opposition that goes beyond that of Jesus ’ ministry and must be seen as expressing the bitter conflict between Pharisaic Judaism and the church of Matthew at the time when the gospel was composed . The complaint often made that the speech ignores the positive qualities of Pharisaism and of its better representatives is true , but the complaint overlooks the circumstances that gave rise to the invective . Nor is the speech purely anti-Pharisaic . The evangelist discerns in his church many of the same faults that he finds in its opponents and warns his fellow Christians to look to their own conduct and attitudes . - 23:2–3 Have taken their seat…Moses : it is uncertain whether this is simply a metaphor for Mosaic teaching authority or refers to an actual chair on which the teacher sat . It has been proved that there was a seat so designated in synagogues of a later period than that of this gospel . Do and observe…they tell you : since the Matthean Jesus abrogates Mosaic law ( Mt 5:31–42 ) , warns his disciples against the teaching of the Pharisees ( Mt 14:1–12 ) , and , in this speech , denounces the Pharisees as blind guides in respect to their teaching on oaths ( Mt 23:16–22 ) , this commandment to observe all things whatsoever they ( the scribes and Pharisees ) tell you can not be taken as the evangelist ’ s understanding of the proper standard of conduct for his church . The saying may reflect a period when the Matthean community was largely Jewish Christian and was still seeking to avoid a complete break with the synagogue . Matthew has incorporated this traditional material into the speech in accordance with his view of the course of salvation history , in which he portrays the time of Jesus ’ ministry as marked by the fidelity to the law , although with significant pointers to the new situation that would exist after his death and resurrection ( see note on Mt 5:17–20 ) . The crowds and the disciples ( Mt 23:1 ) are exhorted not to follow the example of the Jewish leaders , whose deeds do not conform to their teaching ( Mt 23:3 ) . - 23:4 Tie up heavy burdens : see note on Mt 11:28 . - 23:5 To the charge of preaching but not practicing ( Mt 23:3 ) , Jesus adds that of acting in order to earn praise . The disciples have already been warned against this same fault ( see note on Mt 6:1–18 ) . Phylacteries : the Mosaic law required that during prayer small boxes containing parchments on which verses of scripture were written be worn on the left forearm and the forehead ( see Ex 13:9 ,
NABRE	Matthew	23	70	. You will not see me…in the name of the Lord : Israel will not see Jesus again until he comes in glory for the final judgment . The acclamation has been interpreted in contrasting ways , as an indication that Israel will at last accept Jesus at that time , and as its troubled recognition of him as its dreaded judge who will pronounce its condemnation ; in support of the latter view see Mt 24:30 .

NABRE	Matthew	24	1	Thes 4:16 . - 24:32–35 Cf . Mk 13:28–31 . - 24:34 The difficulty raised by this verse can not be satisfactorily removed by the supposition that this generation means the Jewish people throughout the course of their history , much less the entire human race . Perhaps for Matthew it means the generation to which he and his community belonged . - 24:36–44 The statement of Mt 24:34 is now counterbalanced by one that declares that the exact time of the parousia is known only to the Father ( Mt 24:36 ) , and the disciples are warned to be always ready for it . This section is drawn from Mark and Q ( cf . Lk 17:26–27 , 34–35 ; 12:39–40 ) . - 24:36 Many textual witnesses omit nor the Son , which follows Mk 13:32 . Since its omission can be explained by reluctance to attribute this ignorance to the Son , the reading that includes it is probably original . - 24:37–39 Cf . Lk 17:26–27 . In the days of Noah : the Old Testament account of the flood lays no emphasis upon what is central for Matthew , i.e. , the unexpected coming of the flood upon those who were unprepared for it . - 24:40–41 Cf . Lk 17:34–35 . Taken…left : the former probably means taken into the kingdom ; the latter , left for destruction . People in the same situation will be dealt with in opposite ways . In this context , the discrimination between them will be based on their readiness for the coming of the Son of Man . - 24:42–44 Cf . Lk 12:39–40 . The theme of vigilance and readiness is continued with the bold comparison of the Son of Man to a thief who comes to break into a house . - 24:45–51 The second part of the discourse ( see note on Mt 24:1–25:46 ) begins with this parable of the faithful or unfaithful servant ; cf . Lk 12:41–46 . It is addressed to the leaders of Matthew ’ s church ; the servant has been put in charge of his master ’ s household ( Mt 24:45 ) even though that household is composed of those who are his fellow servants ( Mt 24:49 ) . - 24:45 To distribute…proper time : readiness for the master ’ s return means a vigilance that is accompanied by faithful performance of the duty assigned . - 24:48 My master…delayed : the note of delay is found also in the other parables of this section ; cf . Mt 25:5 ,

While it is questionable that that is an acceptable understanding of the Old Testament predictions , it may be applicable here , for Matthew knew that the parousia had not come immediately after the fall of Jerusalem , and it is unlikely that he is attributing a mistaken calculation of time to Jesus .

Footnotes - 24:1–25:46 The discourse of the fifth book , the last of the five around which the gospel is structured . It is called the “ eschatological ” discourse since it deals with the coming of the new age ( the eschaton ) in its fullness , with events that will precede it , and with how the disciples are to conduct themselves while awaiting an event that is as certain as its exact time is unknown to all but the Father ( Mt 24:36 ) . The discourse may be divided into two parts , Mt 24:1–44 and Mt 24:45–25:46 . In the first , Matthew follows his Marcan source ( Mk 13:1–37 ) closely . The second is drawn from Q and from the evangelist ’ s own traditional material . Both parts show Matthew ’ s editing of his sources by deletions , additions , and modifications . The vigilant waiting that is emphasized in the second part does not mean a cessation of ordinary activity and concentration only on what is to come , but a faithful accomplishment of duties at hand , with awareness that the end , for which the disciples must always be ready , will entail the great judgment by which the everlasting destiny of all will be determined . - 24:2 As in Mark , Jesus predicts the destruction of the temple . By omitting the Marcan story of the widow ’ s contribution ( Mk 12:41–44 ) that immediately precedes the prediction in that gospel , Matthew has established a close connection between it and Mt 23:38 , “ …your house will be abandoned desolate. ” - 24:3 The Mount of Olives : see note on Mt 21:1 . The disciples : cf . Mk 13:3–4 where only Peter , James , John , and Andrew put the question that is answered by the discourse . In both gospels , however , the question is put privately : the ensuing discourse is only for those who are disciples of Jesus . When will this happen…end of the age ? : Matthew distinguishes carefully between the destruction of the temple ( this ) and the coming of Jesus that will bring the end of the age . In Mark the two events are more closely connected , a fact that may be explained by Mark ’ s believing that the one would immediately succeed the other . Coming : this translates the Greek word parousia , which is used in the gospels only here and in Mt 24:27 ,

But leaving aside the problem of what the traditional material that Matthew edited may have meant , it seems that a stronger case can be made for the view that in the evangelist ’ s sense the sufferers are Christians , probably Christian missionaries whose sufferings were brought upon them by their preaching of the gospel . The criterion of judgment for all the nations is their treatment of those who have borne to the world the message of Jesus , and this means ultimately their acceptance or rejection of Jesus himself ; cf . Mt 10:40 , “ Whoever receives you , receives me. ” See note on Mt 16:27 . - 25:32 All the nations : before the end the gospel will have been preached throughout the world ( Mt 24:14 ) ; thus the Gentiles will be judged on their response to it . But the phrase all the nations includes the Jews also , for at the judgment “ the Son of Man…will repay everyone according to his conduct ” ( Mt 16:27 ) . - 25:37–40 The righteous will be astonished that in caring for the needs of the sufferers they were ministering to the Lord himself . One of these least brothers of mine : cf . Mt 10:42 . - 25:41 Fire prepared…his angels : cf .
NABRE	Matthew	25	37	Then the righteous [ p ] will answer him and say , ‘ Lord , when did we see you hungry and feed you , or thirsty and give you drink ?
NABRE	Matthew	25	38	When did we see you a stranger and welcome you , or naked and clothe you ?
NABRE	Matthew	25	39	When did we see you ill or in prison , and visit you ? ’
NABRE	Matthew	25	40	( I ) And the king will say to them in reply , ‘ Amen , I say to you , whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine , you did for me. ’
NABRE	Matthew	25	41	[ q ] ( J ) Then he will say to those on his left , ‘ Depart from me , you accursed , into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels .
NABRE	Matthew	25	42	( K ) For I was hungry and you gave me no food , I was thirsty and you gave me no drink ,
NABRE	Matthew	25	43	a stranger and you gave me no welcome , naked and you gave me no clothing , ill and in prison , and you did not care for me. ’

Lk 19:12–27 . - 25:14 It will be as when…journey : literally , “ For just as a man who was going on a journey. ” Although the comparison is not completed , the sense is clear ; the kingdom of heaven is like the situation here described . Faithful use of one ’ s gifts will lead to participation in the fullness of the kingdom , lazy inactivity to exclusion from it . - 25:15 Talents : see note on Mt 18:24 . - 25:18 Buried his master ’ s money : see note on Mt 13:44 . - 25:20–23 Although the first two servants have received and doubled large sums , their faithful trading is regarded by the master as fidelity in small matters only , compared with the great responsibilities now to be given to them . The latter are unspecified . Share your master ’ s joy : probably the joy of the banquet of the kingdom ; cf . Mt 8:11 . - 25:26–28 Wicked , lazy servant : this man ’ s inactivity is not negligible but seriously culpable . As punishment , he loses the gift he had received , that is now given to the first servant , whose possessions are already great . - 25:29 See note on Mt 13:12 where there is a similar application of this maxim . - 25:30 See note on Mt 8:11–12 . - 25:31–46 The conclusion of the discourse , which is peculiar to Matthew , portrays the final judgment that will accompany the parousia . Although often called a “ parable , ” it is not really such , for the only parabolic elements are the depiction of the Son of Man as a shepherd and of the righteous and the wicked as sheep and goats , respectively ( Mt 25:32–33 ) . The criterion of judgment will be the deeds of mercy that have been done for the least of Jesus ’ brothers ( Mt 25:40 ) . A difficult and important question is the identification of these least brothers . Are they all people who have suffered hunger , thirst , etc . ( Mt 25:35 ,
NABRE	Matthew	25	45	He will answer them , ‘ Amen , I say to you , what you did not do for one of these least ones , you did not do for me. ’

NABRE	Matthew	26	26	and
NABRE	Matthew	26	1	Cor 11:25 ; Lk 22:20 ; and there is parallelism between the consecratory words ( this is my body…this is my blood ) . Matthew follows Mark closely but with some changes . - 26:26 See note on Mt 14:19 . Said the blessing : a prayer blessing God . Take and eat : literally , Take , eat . Eat is an addition to Mark ’ s “ take it ” ( literally , “ take ” ; Mk 14:22 ) . This is my body : the bread is identified with Jesus himself . - 26:27–28 Gave thanks : see note on Mt 15:36 . Gave it to them…all of you : cf . Mk 14:23–24 . In the Marcan sequence the disciples drink and then Jesus says the interpretative words . Matthew has changed this into a command to drink followed by those words . My blood : see Lv 17:11 for the concept that the blood is “ the seat of life ” and that when placed on the altar it “ makes atonement. ” Which will be shed : the present participle , “ being shed ” or “ going to be shed , ” is future in relation to the Last Supper . On behalf of : Greek peri ; see note on Mk 14:24 . Many : see note on Mt 20:28 . For the forgiveness of sins : a Matthean addition . The same phrase occurs in Mk 1:4 in connection with John ’ s baptism but Matthew avoids it there ( Mt 3:11 ) . He places it here probably because he wishes to emphasize that it is the sacrificial death of Jesus that brings forgiveness of sins . - 26:29 Although his death will interrupt the table fellowship he has had with the disciples , Jesus confidently predicts his vindication by God and a new table fellowship with them at the banquet of the kingdom . - 26:30 See note on Mk 14:26 . - 26:31 Will have…shaken : literally , “ will be scandalized in me ” ; see note on Mt 24:9–12 . I will strike…dispersed : cf . Zec 13:7 . - 26:34 Before the cock crows : see note on Mt 14:25 . The third watch of the night was called “ cockcrow. ” Deny me : see note on Mt 16:24 . - 26:36–56 Cf . Mk 14:32–52 . The account of Jesus in Gethsemane is divided between that of his agony ( Mt 26:36–46 ) and that of his betrayal and arrest ( Mt 26:47–56 ) . Jesus ’ sorrow and distress ( Mt 26:37 ) in face of death is unrelieved by the presence of his three disciples who , though urged to watch with him ( Mt 26:38 ,
NABRE	Matthew	26	2	( A ) “ You know that in two days ’ time it will be Passover , and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified. ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	3	[ c ] Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas ,
NABRE	Matthew	26	4	( B ) and they consulted together to arrest Jesus by treachery and put him to death .
NABRE	Matthew	26	5	. Those who judge the gospel accounts of Jesus ’ trial by the later Mishnah standards point out that Jesus uses the surrogate “ the Power , ” and hence no Jewish court would have regarded him as guilty of blasphemy ; others hold that the Mishnah ’ s narrow understanding of blasphemy was a later development . - 26:67–68 The physical abuse , apparently done to Jesus by the members of the Sanhedrin themselves , recalls the sufferings of the Isaian Servant of the Lord ; cf . Is 50:6 . The mocking challenge to prophesy is probably motivated by Jesus ’ prediction of his future glory ( Mt 26:64 ) . - 26:70 Denied it in front of everyone : see Mt 10:33 . Peter ’ s repentance ( Mt 26:75 ) saves him from the fearful destiny of which Jesus speaks there . - 26:73 Your speech…away : Matthew explicates Mark ’ s “ you too are a Galilean ” ( Mk 14:70 ) .

NABRE	Matthew	26	6	( C ) Now when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper ,
NABRE	Matthew	26	7	a woman came up to him with an alabaster jar of costly perfumed oil , and poured it on his head while he was reclining at table .
NABRE	Matthew	26	8	When the disciples saw this , they were indignant and said , “ Why this waste ?
NABRE	Matthew	26	9	It could have been sold for much , and the money given to the poor. ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	10	Since Jesus knew this , he said to them , “ Why do you make trouble for the woman ? She has done a good thing for me .
NABRE	Matthew	26	11	( D ) The poor you will always have with you ; but you will not always have me .
NABRE	Matthew	26	12	) the same Greek word for sorrowful is used as here . To death : i.e. , “ enough to die ” ; cf . Jon 4:9 . - 26:39 My Father : see note on Mk 14:36 . Matthew omits the Aramaic ’ abbā ’ and adds the qualifier my . This cup : see note on Mk 10:38–40 . - 26:41 Undergo the test : see note on Mt 6:13 . In that verse “ the final test ” translates the same Greek word as is here translated the test , and these are the only instances of the use of that word in Matthew . It is possible that the passion of Jesus is seen here as an anticipation of the great tribulation that will precede the parousia ( see notes on Mt 24:8 ; 24:21 ) to which Mt 6:13 refers , and that just as Jesus prays to be delivered from death ( Mt 26:39 ) , so he exhorts the disciples to pray that they will not have to undergo the great test that his passion would be for them . Some scholars , however , understand not undergo ( literally , “ not enter ” ) the test as meaning not that the disciples may be spared the test but that they may not yield to the temptation of falling away from Jesus because of his passion even though they will have to endure it . - 26:42 Your will be done : cf . Mt 6:10 . - 26:49 Rabbi : see note on Mt 23:6–7 . Jesus is so addressed twice in Matthew ( Mt 26:25 ) , both times by Judas . For the significance of the closely related address “ teacher ” in Matthew , see note on Mt 8:19 . - 26:55 Day after day…arrest me : cf . Mk 14:49 . This suggests that Jesus had taught for a relatively long period in Jerusalem , whereas Mt 21:1–11 puts his coming to the city for the first time only a few days before . - 26:57–68 Following Mk 14:53–65 Matthew presents the nighttime appearance of Jesus before the Sanhedrin as a real trial . After many false witnesses bring charges against him that do not suffice for the death sentence ( Mt 26:60 ) , two came forward who charge him with claiming to be able to destroy the temple…and within three days to rebuild it ( Mt 26:60–61 ) . Jesus makes no answer even when challenged to do so by the high priest , who then orders him to declare under oath…whether he is the Messiah , the Son of God ( Mt 26:62–63 ) . Matthew changes Mark ’ s clear affirmative response ( Mk 14:62 ) to the same one as that given to Judas ( Mt 26:25 ) , but follows Mark almost verbatim in Jesus ’ predicting that his judges will see him ( the Son of Man ) seated at the right hand of God and coming on the clouds of heaven ( Mt 26:64 ) . The high priest then charges him with blasphemy ( Mt 26:65 ) , a charge with which the other members of the Sanhedrin agree by declaring that he deserves to die ( Mt 26:66 ) . They then attack him ( Mt 26:67 ) and mockingly demand that he prophesy ( Mt 26:68 ) . This account contains elements that are contrary to the judicial procedures prescribed in the Mishnah , the Jewish code of law that dates in written form from ca . A.D.
NABRE	Matthew	26	13	Amen , I say to you , wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world , what she has done will be spoken of , in memory of her. ” The Betrayal by Judas .
NABRE	Matthew	26	14	and put to death the following day . No reason is given why the plan was changed . - 26:6–13 See notes on Mk 14:3–9 and Jn 12:1–8 . - 26:12 To prepare me for burial : cf . Mk 14:8 . In accordance with the interpretation of this act as Jesus ’ burial anointing , Matthew , more consistent than Mark , changes the purpose of the visit of the women to Jesus ’ tomb ; they do not go to anoint him ( Mk 16:1 ) but “ to see the tomb ” ( Mt 28:1 ) . - 26:14 Iscariot : see note on Lk 6:16 . - 26:15 The motive of avarice is introduced by Judas ’ s question about the price for betrayal , which is absent in the Marcan source ( Mk 14:10–11 ) . Hand him over : the same Greek verb is used to express the saving purpose of God by which Jesus is handed over to death ( cf . Mt 17:22 ; 20:18 ; 26:2 ) and the human malice that hands him over . Thirty pieces of silver : the price of the betrayal is found only in Matthew . It is derived from Zec 11:12 where it is the wages paid to the rejected shepherd , a cheap price ( Zec 11:13 ) . That amount is also the compensation paid to one whose slave has been gored by an ox ( Ex 21:32 ) . - 26:17 The first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread : see note on Mk 14:1 . Matthew omits Mark ’ s “ when they sacrificed the Passover lamb. ” - 26:18 By omitting much of Mk 14:13–15 , adding My appointed time draws near , and turning the question into a statement , in your house I shall celebrate the Passover , Matthew has given this passage a solemnity and majesty greater than that of his source . - 26:21 Given Matthew ’ s interest in the fulfillment of the Old Testament , it is curious that he omits the Marcan designation of Jesus ’ betrayer as “ one who is eating with me ” ( Mk 14:18 ) , since that is probably an allusion to Ps 41:10 . However , the shocking fact that the betrayer is one who shares table fellowship with Jesus is emphasized in Mt 26:23 . - 26:24 It would be better…born : the enormity of the deed is such that it would be better not to exist than to do it . - 26:25 Peculiar to Matthew . You have said so : cf . Mt 26:64 ; 27:11 . This is a half-affirmative . Emphasis is laid on the pronoun and the answer implies that the statement would not have been made if the question had not been asked . - 26:26–29 See note on Mk 14:22–24 . The Marcan-Matthean is one of the two major New Testament traditions of the words of Jesus when instituting the Eucharist . The other ( and earlier ) is the Pauline-Lucan (
NABRE	Matthew	26	15	[ h ] ( F ) and said , “ What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you ? ” They paid him thirty pieces of silver ,
NABRE	Matthew	26	16	and from that time on he looked for an opportunity to hand him over . Preparations for the Passover .
NABRE	Matthew	26	17	( G ) On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread , [ i ] the disciples approached Jesus and said , “ Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover ? ” ( H )
NABRE	Matthew	26	18	to
NABRE	Matthew	26	19	) . Some of the additions indicate that he utilized traditions that he had received from elsewhere ; others are due to his own theological insight ( e.g. , Mt 26:28 “ …for the forgiveness of sins ” ; Mt 27:52 ) . In his editing Matthew also altered Mark in some minor details . But there is no need to suppose that he knew any passion narrative other than Mark ’ s . - 26:1–2 When Jesus finished all these words : see note on Mt 7:28–29 . “ You know…crucified ” : Matthew turns Mark ’ s statement of the time ( Mk 14:1 ) into Jesus ’ final prediction of his passion . Passover : see note on Mk 14:1 . - 26:3 Caiaphas was high priest from A.D.
NABRE	Matthew	26	20	When it was evening , he reclined at table with the Twelve .
NABRE	Matthew	26	21	And while they were eating , he said , “ Amen , I say to you , one of you will betray me. ” [ k ]
NABRE	Matthew	26	22	Deeply distressed at this , they began to say to him one after another , “ Surely it is not I , Lord ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	23	He said in reply , “ He who has dipped his hand into the dish with me is the one who will betray me .
NABRE	Matthew	26	24	[ l ] ( I ) The Son of Man indeed goes , as it is written of him , but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed . It would be better for that man if he had never been born. ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	25	[ m ] Then Judas , his betrayer , said in reply , “ Surely it is not I , Rabbi ? ” He answered , “ You have said so. ” The Lord ’ s Supper .
NABRE	Matthew	26	27	) Matthew follows his Marcan source closely but with omissions ( e.g. , Mk 14:51–52 ) and additions ( e.g. , Mt 27:3–10 ,
NABRE	Matthew	26	28	( L ) for this is my blood of the covenant , which will be shed on behalf of many for the forgiveness of sins .
NABRE	Matthew	26	29	[ q ] I tell you , from now on I shall not drink this fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father. ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	30	[ r ] Then , after singing a hymn , they went out to the Mount of Olives . Peter ’ s Denial Foretold .
NABRE	Matthew	26	31	) . In this episode , Matthew follows Mark with a few alterations . - 26:36 Gethsemane : the Hebrew name means “ oil press ” and designates an olive orchard on the western slope of the Mount of Olives ; see note on Mt 21:1 . The name appears only in Matthew and Mark . The place is called a “ garden ” in Jn 18:1 . - 26:37 Peter and the two sons of Zebedee : cf . Mt 17:1 . - 26:38 Cf . Ps 42:6 ,
NABRE	Matthew	26	32	but after I have been raised up , I shall go before you to Galilee. ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	33	Peter said to him in reply , “ Though all may have their faith in you shaken , mine will never be. ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	34	[ t ] ( O ) Jesus said to him , “ Amen , I say to you , this very night before the cock crows , you will deny me three times. ” ( P )
NABRE	Matthew	26	35	Peter said to him , “ Even though I should have to die with you , I will not deny you. ” And all the disciples spoke likewise . The Agony in the Garden .
NABRE	Matthew	26	36	. - 26:5 Not during the festival : the plan to delay Jesus ’ arrest and execution until after the festival was not carried out , for according to the synoptics he was arrested on the night of Nisan
NABRE	Matthew	26	37	( S ) He took along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , [ w ] and began to feel sorrow and distress .
NABRE	Matthew	26	38	( T ) Then he said to them , “ My soul is sorrowful even to death . [ x ] Remain here and keep watch with me. ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	39	( U ) He advanced a little and fell prostrate in prayer , saying , “ My Father , [ y ] if it is possible , let this cup pass from me ; yet , not as I will , but as you will. ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	40	When he returned to his disciples he found them asleep . He said to Peter , “ So you could not keep watch with me for one hour ?
NABRE	Matthew	26	41	) , fall asleep ( Mt 26:40 ,
NABRE	Matthew	26	42	,
NABRE	Matthew	26	43	) . He prays that if…possible his death may be avoided ( Mt 26:39 ) but that his Father ’ s will be done ( Mt 26:39 ,
NABRE	Matthew	26	44	) . Knowing then that his death must take place , he announces to his companions that the hour for his being handed over has come ( Mt 26:45 ) . Judas arrives with an armed band provided by the Sanhedrin and greets Jesus with a kiss , the prearranged sign for his identification ( Mt 26:47–49 ) . After his arrest , he rebukes a disciple who has attacked the high priest ’ s servant with a sword ( Mt 26:51–54 ) , and chides those who have come out to seize him with swords and clubs as if he were a robber ( Mt 26:55–56 ) . In both rebukes Jesus declares that the treatment he is now receiving is the fulfillment of the scriptures ( Mt 26:55 ,
NABRE	Matthew	26	45	( W ) Then he returned to his disciples and said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and taking your rest ? Behold , the hour is at hand when the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners .
NABRE	Matthew	26	46	Get up , let us go . Look , my betrayer is at hand. ” The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus .
NABRE	Matthew	26	47	( X ) While he was still speaking , Judas , one of the Twelve , arrived , accompanied by a large crowd , with swords and clubs , who had come from the chief priests and the elders of the people .
NABRE	Matthew	26	48	His betrayer had arranged a sign with them , saying , “ The man I shall kiss is the one ; arrest him. ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	49	Immediately he went over to Jesus and said , “ Hail , Rabbi ! ” [ ab ] and he kissed him .
NABRE	Matthew	26	50	Jesus answered him , “ Friend , do what you have come for. ” Then stepping forward they laid hands on Jesus and arrested him .
NABRE	Matthew	26	51	And behold , one of those who accompanied Jesus put his hand to his sword , drew it , and struck the high priest ’ s servant , cutting off his ear .
NABRE	Matthew	26	52	Then Jesus said to him , “ Put your sword back into its sheath , for all who take the sword will perish by the sword .
NABRE	Matthew	26	53	Do you think that I can not call upon my Father and he will not provide me at this moment with more than twelve legions of angels ?
NABRE	Matthew	26	54	But then how would the scriptures be fulfilled which say that it must come to pass in this way ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	55	[ ac ] At that hour Jesus said to the crowds , “ Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs to seize me ? Day after day I sat teaching in the temple area , yet you did not arrest me .
NABRE	Matthew	26	56	) . The subsequent flight of all the disciples is itself the fulfillment of his own prediction ( cf .
NABRE	Matthew	26	57	( Z ) Those who had arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas [ ae ] the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were assembled .
NABRE	Matthew	26	58	Peter was following him at a distance as far as the high priest ’ s courtyard , and going inside he sat down with the servants to see the outcome .
NABRE	Matthew	26	59	The chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin [ af ] kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death ,
NABRE	Matthew	26	60	( AA ) but they found none , though many false witnesses came forward . Finally two [ ag ] came forward
NABRE	Matthew	26	61	who stated , “ This man said , ‘ I can destroy the temple of God and within three days rebuild it. ’ ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	62	The high priest rose and addressed him , “ Have you no answer ? What are these men testifying against you ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	63	( AB ) But Jesus was silent . [ ah ] Then the high priest said to him , “ I order you to tell us under oath before the living God whether you are the Messiah , the Son of God. ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	64	( AC ) Jesus said to him in reply , “ You have said so . [ ai ] But I tell you : From now on you will see ‘ the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power ’ and ‘ coming on the clouds of heaven. ’ ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priest tore his robes and said , “ He has blasphemed ! [ aj ] What further need have we of witnesses ? You have now heard the blasphemy ;
NABRE	Matthew	26	66	what is your opinion ? ” They said in reply , “ He deserves to die ! ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	67	[ ak ] ( AD ) Then they spat in his face and struck him , while some slapped him ,
NABRE	Matthew	26	68	saying , “ Prophesy for us , Messiah : who is it that struck you ? ” Peter ’ s Denial of Jesus .
NABRE	Matthew	26	69	( AE ) Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard . One of the maids came over to him and said , “ You too were with Jesus the Galilean. ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	70	[ al ] But he denied it in front of everyone , saying , “ I do not know what you are talking about ! ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	71	As he went out to the gate , another girl saw him and said to those who were there , “ This man was with Jesus the Nazorean. ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	72	Again he denied it with an oath , “ I do not know the man ! ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	73	[ am ] A little later the bystanders came over and said to Peter , “ Surely you too are one of them ; even your speech gives you away. ”
NABRE	Matthew	26	74	At that he began to curse and to swear , “ I do not know the man. ” And immediately a cock crowed .
NABRE	Matthew	26	75	( AF ) Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken : “ Before the cock crows you will deny me three times. ” He went out and began to weep bitterly . Footnotes - 26:1–28:20 The five books with alternating narrative and discourse ( Mt 3:1–25:46 ) that give this gospel its distinctive structure lead up to the climactic events that are the center of Christian belief and the origin of the Christian church , the passion and resurrection of Jesus . In his passion narrative ( Mt
NABRE	Matthew	26	200	, e.g. , trial on a feast day , a night session of the court , pronouncement of a verdict of condemnation at the same session at which testimony was received . Consequently , some scholars regard the account entirely as a creation of the early Christians without historical value . However , it is disputable whether the norms found in the Mishnah were in force at the time of Jesus . More to the point is the question whether the Matthean-Marcan night trial derives from a combination of two separate incidents , a nighttime preliminary investigation ( cf . Jn 18:13 , 19–24 ) and a formal trial on the following morning ( cf . Lk 22:66–71 ) . - 26:57 Caiaphas : see note on Mt 26:3 . - 26:59 Sanhedrin : see note on Lk 22:66 . - 26:60–61 Two : cf . Dt 19:15 . I can destroy…rebuild it : there are significant differences from the Marcan parallel ( Mk 14:58 ) . Matthew omits “ made with hands ” and “ not made with hands ” and changes Mark ’ s “ will destroy ” and “ will build another ” to can destroy and ( can ) rebuild . The charge is probably based on Jesus ’ prediction of the temple ’ s destruction ; see notes on Mt 23:37–39 ; 24:2 ; and Jn 2:19 . A similar prediction by Jeremiah was considered as deserving death ; cf . Jer 7:1–15 ; 26:1–8 . - 26:63 Silent : possibly an allusion to Is 53:7 . I order you…living God : peculiar to Matthew ; cf . Mk 14:61 . - 26:64 You have said so : see note on Mt 26:25 . From now on…heaven : the Son of Man who is to be crucified ( cf . Mt 20:19 ) will be seen in glorious majesty ( cf . Ps 110:1 ) and coming on the clouds of heaven ( cf . Dn 7:13 ) . The Power : see note on Mk 14:61–62 . - 26:65 Blasphemed : the punishment for blasphemy was death by stoning ( see Lv 24:10–16 ) . According to the Mishnah , to be guilty of blasphemy one had to pronounce “ the Name itself , ” i.e. , Yahweh ; cf . Sanhedrin 7:4 ,

NABRE	Matthew	27	1	[ a ] When it was morning , ( A ) all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel [ b ] against Jesus to put him to death .
NABRE	Matthew	27	2	Kgs 2:11 ) , was believed to come to the help of those in distress , but the evidences of that belief are all later than the gospels . - 27:50 Gave up his spirit : cf . the Marcan parallel ( Mk 15:37 ) , “ breathed his last. ” Matthew ’ s alteration expresses both Jesus ’ control over his destiny and his obedient giving up of his life to God . - 27:51–53 Veil of the sanctuary…bottom : cf . Mk 15:38 ; Lk 23:45 . Luke puts this event immediately before the death of Jesus . There were two veils in the Mosaic tabernacle on the model of which the temple was constructed , the outer one before the entrance of the Holy Place and the inner one before the Holy of Holies ( see Ex 26:31–36 ) . Only the high priest could pass through the latter and that only on the Day of Atonement ( see Lv 16:1–18 ) . Probably the torn veil of the gospels is the inner one . The meaning of the scene may be that now , because of Jesus ’ death , all people have access to the presence of God , or that the temple , its holiest part standing exposed , is now profaned and will soon be destroyed . The earth quaked…appeared to many : peculiar to Matthew . The earthquake , the splitting of the rocks , and especially the resurrection of the dead saints indicate the coming of the final age . In the Old Testament the coming of God is frequently portrayed with the imagery of an earthquake ( see Ps 68:9 ; 77:19 ) , and Jesus speaks of the earthquakes that will accompany the “ labor pains ” that signify the beginning of the dissolution of the old world ( Mt 24:7–8 ) . For the expectation of the resurrection of the dead at the coming of the new and final age , see Dn 12:1–3 . Matthew knows that the end of the old age has not yet come ( Mt 28:20 ) , but the new age has broken in with the death ( and resurrection ; cf . the earthquake in Mt 28:2 ) of Jesus ; see note on Mt 16:28 . After his resurrection : this qualification seems to be due to Matthew ’ s wish to assert the primacy of Jesus ’ resurrection even though he has placed the resurrection of the dead saints immediately after Jesus ’ death . - 27:54 Cf . Mk 15:39 . The Christian confession of faith is made by Gentiles , not only the centurion , as in Mark , but the other soldiers who were keeping watch over Jesus ( cf . Mt 27:36 ) . - 27:55–56 Looking on from a distance : cf . Ps 38:12 . Mary Magdalene…Joseph : these two women are mentioned again in Mt 27:61 and Mt 28:1 and are important as witnesses of the reality of the empty tomb . A James and Joseph are referred to in Mt 13:55 as brothers of Jesus . - 27:57–61 Cf . Mk 15:42–47 . Matthew drops Mark ’ s designation of Joseph of Arimathea as “ a distinguished member of the council ” ( the Sanhedrin ) , and makes him a rich man and a disciple of Jesus . The former may be an allusion to Is 53:9 ( the Hebrew reading of that text is disputed and the one followed in the NAB OT has nothing about the rich , but they are mentioned in the LXX version ) . That the tomb was the new tomb of a rich man and that it was seen by the women are indications of an apologetic intent of Matthew ; there could be no question about the identity of Jesus ’ burial place . The other Mary : the mother of James and Joseph ( Mt 27:56 ) . - 27:62–66 Peculiar to Matthew . The story prepares for Mt 28:11–15 and the Jewish charge that the tomb was empty because the disciples had stolen the body of Jesus ( Mt 28:13 ,
NABRE	Matthew	27	3	( B ) Then Judas , his betrayer , seeing that Jesus had been condemned , deeply regretted what he had done . He returned the thirty pieces of silver [ c ] to the chief priests and elders , ( C )
NABRE	Matthew	27	4	and Mt 27:17 ,
NABRE	Matthew	27	5	[ d ] Flinging the money into the temple , he departed and went off and hanged himself .
NABRE	Matthew	27	6	. - 27:42 King of Israel : in their mocking of Jesus the members of the Sanhedrin call themselves and their people not “ the Jews ” but Israel . - 27:43 Peculiar to Matthew . He trusted in God…wants him : cf . Ps 22:9 . He said…of God : probably an allusion to Wis 2:12–20 where the theme of the suffering Just One appears . - 27:45 Cf . Am 8:9 where on the day of the Lord “ the sun will set at midday. ” - 27:46 Eli , Eli , lema sabachthani ? : Jesus cries out in the words of Ps 22:2a , a psalm of lament that is the Old Testament passage most frequently drawn upon in this narrative . In Mark the verse is cited entirely in Aramaic , which Matthew partially retains but changes the invocation of God to the Hebrew Eli , possibly because that is more easily related to the statement of the following verse about Jesus ’ calling for Elijah . - 27:47 Elijah : see note on Mt 3:4 . This prophet , taken up into heaven (
NABRE	Matthew	27	7	After consultation , they used it to buy the potter ’ s field as a burial place for foreigners .
NABRE	Matthew	27	8	That is why that field even today is called the Field of Blood .
NABRE	Matthew	27	9	Then was fulfilled what had been said through Jeremiah the prophet , [ e ] “ And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the value of a man with a price on his head , a price set by some of the Israelites ,
NABRE	Matthew	27	10	( D ) and they paid it out for the potter ’ s field just as the Lord had commanded me. ” Jesus Questioned by Pilate .
NABRE	Matthew	27	11	( E ) Now Jesus stood before the governor , and he questioned him , “ Are you the king of the Jews ? ” [ f ] Jesus said , “ You say so. ”
NABRE	Matthew	27	12	) to “ ( Jesus ) called Messiah. ” The normal political connotation of both titles would be of concern to the Roman governor . You say so : see note on Mt 26:25 . An unqualified affirmative response is not made because Jesus ’ kingship is not what Pilate would understand it to be . - 27:12–14 Cf . Mt 26:62–63 . As in the trial before the Sanhedrin , Jesus ’ silence may be meant to recall Is 53:7 . Greatly amazed : possibly an allusion to Is 52:14–15 . - 27:15–26 The choice that Pilate offers the crowd between Barabbas and Jesus is said to be in accordance with a custom of releasing at the Passover feast one prisoner chosen by the crowd ( Mt 27:15 ) . This custom is mentioned also in Mk 15:6 and Jn 18:39 but not in Luke ; see note on Lk 23:17 . Outside of the gospels there is no direct attestation of it , and scholars are divided in their judgment of the historical reliability of the claim that there was such a practice . - 27:16–17 [ Jesus ] Barabbas : it is possible that the double name is the original reading ; Jesus was a common Jewish name ; see note on Mt 1:21 . This reading is found in only a few textual witnesses , although its absence in the majority can be explained as an omission of Jesus made for reverential reasons . That name is bracketed because of its uncertain textual attestation . The Aramaic name Barabbas means “ son of the father ” ; the irony of the choice offered between him and Jesus , the true son of the Father , would be evident to those addressees of Matthew who knew that . - 27:18 Cf . Mk 14:10 . This is an example of the tendency , found in varying degree in all the gospels , to present Pilate in a relatively favorable light and emphasize the hostility of the Jewish authorities and eventually of the people . - 27:19 Jesus ’ innocence is declared by a Gentile woman . In a dream : in Matthew ’ s infancy narrative , dreams are the means of divine communication ; cf . Mt 1:20 ; 2:12 ,
NABRE	Matthew	27	13	,
NABRE	Matthew	27	14	But he did not answer him one word , so that the governor was greatly amazed . The Sentence of Death .
NABRE	Matthew	27	15	) . - 27:62 The next day…preparation : the sabbath . According to the synoptic chronology , in that year the day of preparation ( for the sabbath ) was the Passover ; cf . Mk 15:42 . The Pharisees : the principal opponents of Jesus during his ministry and , in Matthew ’ s time , of the Christian church , join with the chief priests to guarantee against a possible attempt of Jesus ’ disciples to steal his body . - 27:64 This last imposture…the first : the claim that Jesus has been raised from the dead is clearly the last imposture ; the first may be either his claim that he would be raised up ( Mt 27:63 ) or his claim that he was the one with whose ministry the kingdom of God had come ( see Mt 12:28 ) . - 27:65 The guard is yours : literally , “ have a guard ” or “ you have a guard. ” Either the imperative or the indicative could mean that Pilate granted the petitioners some Roman soldiers as guards , which is the sense of the present translation . However , if the verb is taken as an indicative it could also mean that Pilate told them to use their own Jewish guards .

NABRE	Matthew	27	16	[ i ] And at that time they had a notorious prisoner called [ Jesus ] Barabbas .
NABRE	Matthew	27	17	So when they had assembled , Pilate said to them , “ Which one do you want me to release to you , [ Jesus ] Barabbas , or Jesus called Messiah ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	27	18	[ j ] For he knew that it was out of envy that they had handed him over .
NABRE	Matthew	27	19	,
NABRE	Matthew	27	20	( H ) The chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas but to destroy Jesus .
NABRE	Matthew	27	21	The governor said to them in reply , “ Which of the two do you want me to release to you ? ” They answered , “ Barabbas ! ”
NABRE	Matthew	27	22	) . - 27:38 Revolutionaries : see note on Jn 18:40 where the same Greek word as that found here is used for Barabbas . - 27:39–40 Reviled him…heads : cf . Ps 22:8 . You who would destroy…three days ; cf . Mt 26:61 . If you are the Son of God : the same words as those of the devil in the temptation of Jesus ; cf . Mt 4:3 ,
NABRE	Matthew	27	23	But he said , “ Why ? What evil has he done ? ” They only shouted the louder , “ Let him be crucified ! ”
NABRE	Matthew	27	24	[ m ] ( I ) When Pilate saw that he was not succeeding at all , but that a riot was breaking out instead , he took water and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd , saying , “ I am innocent of this man ’ s blood . Look to it yourselves. ”
NABRE	Matthew	27	25	And the whole people said in reply , “ His blood be upon us and upon our children. ”
NABRE	Matthew	27	26	Then he released Barabbas to them , but after he had Jesus scourged , [ n ] he handed him over to be crucified . Mockery by the Soldiers .
NABRE	Matthew	27	28	They stripped off his clothes and threw a scarlet military cloak [ p ] about him .
NABRE	Matthew	27	29	( K ) Weaving a crown out of thorns , [ q ] they placed it on his head , and a reed in his right hand . And kneeling before him , they mocked him , saying , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ”
NABRE	Matthew	27	30	( L ) They spat upon him [ r ] and took the reed and kept striking him on the head .
NABRE	Matthew	27	31	And when they had mocked him , they stripped him of the cloak , dressed him in his own clothes , and led him off to crucify him . The Way of the Cross . [ s ]
NABRE	Matthew	27	32	( M ) As they were going out , they met a Cyrenian named Simon ; this man they pressed into service to carry his cross . The Crucifixion .
NABRE	Matthew	27	33	( N ) And when they came to a place called Golgotha ( which means Place of the Skull ) ,
NABRE	Matthew	27	34	( O ) they gave Jesus wine to drink mixed with gall . [ t ] But when he had tasted it , he refused to drink .
NABRE	Matthew	27	35	( P ) After they had crucified him , they divided his garments [ u ] by casting lots ;
NABRE	Matthew	27	36	then they sat down and kept watch over him there .
NABRE	Matthew	27	37	. Matthew equates it with “ Messiah ” ; cf . Mt 2:2 ,
NABRE	Matthew	27	38	Two revolutionaries [ w ] were crucified with him , one on his right and the other on his left .
NABRE	Matthew	27	39	[ x ] ( Q ) Those passing by reviled him , shaking their heads
NABRE	Matthew	27	40	( R ) and saying , “ You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days , save yourself , if you are the Son of God , [ and ] come down from the cross ! ”
NABRE	Matthew	27	41	Likewise the chief priests with the scribes and elders mocked him and said ,
NABRE	Matthew	27	42	“ He saved others ; he can not save himself . So he is the king of Israel ! [ y ] Let him come down from the cross now , and we will believe in him .
NABRE	Matthew	27	43	[ z ] ( S ) He trusted in God ; let him deliver him now if he wants him . For he said , ‘ I am the Son of God. ’ ”
NABRE	Matthew	27	44	The revolutionaries who were crucified with him also kept abusing him in the same way . The Death of Jesus .
NABRE	Matthew	27	45	[ aa ] ( T ) From noon onward , ( U ) darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon .
NABRE	Matthew	27	46	( V ) And about three o ’ clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice , “ Eli , Eli , lema sabachthani ? ” [ ab ] which means , “ My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? ”
NABRE	Matthew	27	47	[ ac ] Some of the bystanders who heard it said , “ This one is calling for Elijah. ”
NABRE	Matthew	27	48	( W ) Immediately one of them ran to get a sponge ; he soaked it in wine , and putting it on a reed , gave it to him to drink .
NABRE	Matthew	27	49	But the rest said , “ Wait , let us see if Elijah comes to save him. ”
NABRE	Matthew	27	50	[ ad ] But Jesus cried out again in a loud voice , and gave up his spirit .
NABRE	Matthew	27	51	( X ) And behold , the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom . [ ae ] The earth quaked , rocks were split ,
NABRE	Matthew	27	52	( Y ) tombs were opened , and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised .
NABRE	Matthew	27	53	And coming forth from their tombs after his resurrection , they entered the holy city and appeared to many .
NABRE	Matthew	27	54	[ af ] The centurion and the men with him who were keeping watch over Jesus feared greatly when they saw the earthquake and all that was happening , and they said , “ Truly , this was the Son of God ! ”
NABRE	Matthew	27	55	There were many women there , looking on from a distance , [ ag ] who had followed Jesus from Galilee , ministering to him .
NABRE	Matthew	27	56	( Z ) Among them were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph , and the mother of the sons of Zebedee . The Burial of Jesus . [ ah ]
NABRE	Matthew	27	57	( AA ) When it was evening , there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph , who was himself a disciple of Jesus . ( AB )
NABRE	Matthew	27	58	He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus ; then Pilate ordered it to be handed over .
NABRE	Matthew	27	59	Taking the body , Joseph wrapped it [ in ] clean linen
NABRE	Matthew	27	60	and laid it in his new tomb that he had hewn in the rock . Then he rolled a huge stone across the entrance to the tomb and departed .
NABRE	Matthew	27	61	But Mary Magdalene and the other Mary remained sitting there , facing the tomb . The Guard at the Tomb . [ ai ]
NABRE	Matthew	27	62	The next day , the one following the day of preparation , [ aj ] the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate
NABRE	Matthew	27	63	( AC ) and said , “ Sir , we remember that this impostor while still alive said , ‘ After three days I will be raised up. ’
NABRE	Matthew	27	64	Give orders , then , that the grave be secured until the third day , lest his disciples come and steal him and say to the people , ‘ He has been raised from the dead. ’ This last imposture would be worse than the first. ” [ ak ]
NABRE	Matthew	27	65	Pilate said to them , “ The guard is yours ; [ al ] go secure it as best you can. ”
NABRE	Matthew	27	66	So they went and secured the tomb by fixing a seal to the stone and setting the guard . Footnotes - 27:1–31 Cf . Mk 15:1–20 . Matthew ’ s account of the Roman trial before Pilate is introduced by a consultation of the Sanhedrin after which Jesus is handed over to…the governor ( Mt 27:1–2 ) . Matthew follows his Marcan source closely but adds some material that is peculiar to him , the death of Judas ( Mt 27:3–10 ) , possibly the name Jesus as the name of Barabbas also ( Mt 27:16–17 ) , the intervention of Pilate ’ s wife ( Mt 27:19 ) , Pilate ’ s washing his hands in token of his disclaiming responsibility for Jesus ’ death ( Mt 27:24 ) , and the assuming of that responsibility by the whole people ( Mt 27:25 ) . - 27:1 There is scholarly disagreement about the meaning of the Sanhedrin ’ s taking counsel ( symboulion elabon ; cf . Mt 12:14 ; 22:15 ; 27:7 ; 28:12 ) ; see note on Mk 15:1 . Some understand it as a discussion about the strategy for putting their death sentence against Jesus into effect since they lacked the right to do so themselves . Others see it as the occasion for their passing that sentence , holding that Matthew , unlike Mark ( Mk 14:64 ) , does not consider that it had been passed in the night session ( Mt 26:66 ) . Even in the latter interpretation , their handing him over to Pilate is best explained on the hypothesis that they did not have competence to put their sentence into effect , as is stated in Jn 18:31 . - 27:3 The thirty pieces of silver : see Mt 26:15 . - 27:5–8 For another tradition about the death of Judas , cf . Acts 1:18–19 . The two traditions agree only in the purchase of a field with the money paid to Judas for his betrayal of Jesus and the name given to the field , the Field of Blood . In Acts Judas himself buys the field and its name comes from his own blood shed in his fatal accident on it . The potter ’ s field : this designation of the field is based on the fulfillment citation in Mt 27:10 . - 27:9–10 Cf . Mt 26:15 . Matthew ’ s attributing this text to Jeremiah is puzzling , for there is no such text in that book , and the thirty pieces of silver thrown by Judas “ into the temple ” ( Mt 27:5 ) recall rather Zec 11:12–13 . It is usually said that the attribution of the text to Jeremiah is due to Matthew ’ s combining the Zechariah text with texts from Jeremiah that speak of a potter ( Jer 18:2–3 ) , the buying of a field ( Jer 32:6–9 ) , or the breaking of a potter ’ s flask at Topheth in the valley of Ben-Hinnom with the prediction that it will become a burial place ( Jer 19:1–13 ) . - 27:11 King of the Jews : this title is used of Jesus only by pagans . The Matthean instances are , besides this verse , Mt 2:2 ; 27:29 ,

NABRE	Matthew	28	28	[ a ] The Resurrection of Jesus .
NABRE	Matthew	28	1	Cor 15:5 ; Lk 24:34 ) which Matthew has already incorporated into his account of Peter ’ s confession at Caesarea Philippi ; see note on Mt 16:16 . He is going…Galilee : like Mk 16:7 , a reference to Jesus ’ prediction at the Last Supper ( Mt 26:32 ; Mk 14:28 ) . Matthew changes Mark ’ s “ as he told you ” to a declaration of the angel . - 28:8 Contrast Mk 16:8 where the women in their fear “ said nothing to anyone. ” - 28:9–10 Although these verses are peculiar to Matthew , there are similarities between them and John ’ s account of the appearance of Jesus to Mary Magdalene ( Jn 20:17 ) . In both there is a touching of Jesus ’ body , and a command of Jesus to bear a message to his disciples , designated as his brothers . Matthew may have drawn upon a tradition that appears in a different form in John . Jesus ’ words to the women are mainly a repetition of those of the angel ( Mt 28:5a , 7b ) . - 28:11–15 This account indicates that the dispute between Christians and Jews about the empty tomb was not whether the tomb was empty but why . - 28:16–20 This climactic scene has been called a “ proleptic parousia , ” for it gives a foretaste of the final glorious coming of the Son of Man ( Mt 26:64 ) . Then his triumph will be manifest to all ; now it is revealed only to the disciples , who are commissioned to announce it to all nations and bring them to belief in Jesus and obedience to his commandments . - 28:16 The eleven : the number recalls the tragic defection of Judas Iscariot . To the mountain…ordered them : since the message to the disciples was simply that they were to go to Galilee ( Mt 28:10 ) , some think that the mountain comes from a tradition of the message known to Matthew and alluded to here . For the significance of the mountain , see note on Mt 17:1 . - 28:17 But they doubted : the Greek can also be translated , “ but some doubted. ” The verb occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in Mt 14:31 where it is associated with Peter ’ s being of “ little faith. ” For the meaning of that designation , see note on Mt 6:30 . - 28:18 All power…me : the Greek word here translated power is the same as that found in the LXX translation of Dn 7:13–14 where one “ like a son of man ” is given power and an everlasting kingdom by God . The risen Jesus here claims universal power , i.e. , in heaven and on earth . - 28:19 Therefore : since universal power belongs to the risen Jesus ( Mt 28:18 ) , he gives the eleven a mission that is universal . They are to make disciples of all nations . While all nations is understood by some scholars as referring only to all Gentiles , it is probable that it included the Jews as well . Baptizing them : baptism is the means of entrance into the community of the risen one , the Church . In the name of the Father…holy Spirit : this is perhaps the clearest expression in the New Testament of trinitarian belief . It may have been the baptismal formula of Matthew ’ s church , but primarily it designates the effect of baptism , the union of the one baptized with the Father , Son , and holy Spirit . - 28:20 All that I have commanded you : the moral teaching found in this gospel , preeminently that of the Sermon on the Mount ( Mt 5–7 ) . The commandments of Jesus are the standard of Christian conduct , not the Mosaic law as such , even though some of the Mosaic commandments have now been invested with the authority of Jesus . Behold , I am with you always : the promise of Jesus ’ real though invisible presence echoes the name Emmanuel given to him in the infancy narrative ; see note on Mt 1:23 . End of the age : see notes on Mt 13:39 and Mt 24:3 .

NABRE	Matthew	28	2	[ c ] ( B ) And behold , there was a great earthquake ; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven , approached , rolled back the stone , and sat upon it .
NABRE	Matthew	28	3	( C ) His appearance was like lightning and his clothing was white as snow .
NABRE	Matthew	28	4	The guards were shaken with fear of him and became like dead men .
NABRE	Matthew	28	5	Then the angel said to the women in reply , “ Do not be afraid ! I know that you are seeking Jesus the crucified .
NABRE	Matthew	28	6	[ d ] He is not here , for he has been raised just as he said . Come and see the place where he lay .
NABRE	Matthew	28	7	( D ) Then go quickly and tell his disciples , ‘ He has been raised from the dead , and he is going before you to Galilee ; there you will see him. ’ Behold , I have told you. ”
NABRE	Matthew	28	8	Then they went away quickly from the tomb , fearful yet overjoyed , and ran to announce [ e ] this to his disciples .
NABRE	Matthew	28	9	[ f ] ( E ) And behold , Jesus met them on their way and greeted them . They approached , embraced his feet , and did him homage .
NABRE	Matthew	28	10	Then Jesus said to them , “ Do not be afraid . Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee , and there they will see me. ” The Report of the Guard . [ g ]
NABRE	Matthew	28	11	While they were going , some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had happened .
NABRE	Matthew	28	12	They assembled with the elders and took counsel ; then they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers ,
NABRE	Matthew	28	13	telling them , “ You are to say , ‘ His disciples came by night and stole him while we were asleep. ’
NABRE	Matthew	28	14	And if this gets to the ears of the governor , we will satisfy [ him ] and keep you out of trouble. ”
NABRE	Matthew	28	15	The soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed . And this story has circulated among the Jews to the present [ day ] . The Commissioning of the Disciples . [ h ]
NABRE	Matthew	28	16	( F ) The eleven [ i ] disciples went to Galilee , to the mountain to which Jesus had ordered them .
NABRE	Matthew	28	17	[ j ] When they saw him , they worshiped , but they doubted .
NABRE	Matthew	28	18	[ k ] ( G ) Then Jesus approached and said to them , “ All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me .
NABRE	Matthew	28	19	( H ) Go , therefore , [ l ] and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the holy Spirit ,
NABRE	Matthew	28	20	( I ) teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you . [ m ] And behold , I am with you always , until the end of the age. ” Footnotes - 28:1–20 Except for Mt 28:1–8 based on Mk 16:1–8 , the material of this final chapter is peculiar to Matthew . Even where he follows Mark , Matthew has altered his source so greatly that a very different impression is given from that of the Marcan account . The two points that are common to the resurrection testimony of all the gospels are that the tomb of Jesus had been found empty and that the risen Jesus had appeared to certain persons , or , in the original form of Mark , that such an appearance was promised as soon to take place ( see Mk 16:7 ) . On this central and all-important basis , Matthew has constructed an account that interprets the resurrection as the turning of the ages ( Mt 28:2–4 ) , shows the Jewish opposition to Jesus as continuing to the present in the claim that the resurrection is a deception perpetrated by the disciples who stole his body from the tomb ( Mt 28:11–15 ) , and marks a new stage in the mission of the disciples once limited to Israel ( Mt 10:5–6 ) ; now they are to make disciples of all nations . In this work they will be strengthened by the presence of the exalted Son of Man , who will be with them until the kingdom comes in fullness at the end of the age ( Mt 28:16–20 ) . - 28:1 After the sabbath…dawning : since the sabbath ended at sunset , this could mean in the early evening , for dawning can refer to the appearance of the evening star ; cf . Lk 23:54 . However , it is probable that Matthew means the morning dawn of the day after the sabbath , as in the similar though slightly different text of Mark , “ when the sun had risen ” ( Mk 16:2 ) . Mary Magdalene and the other Mary : see notes on Mt 27:55–56 ; 57–61 . To see the tomb : cf . Mk 16:1–2 where the purpose of the women ’ s visit is to anoint Jesus ’ body . - 28:2–4 Peculiar to Matthew . A great earthquake : see note on Mt 27:51–53 . Descended from heaven : this trait is peculiar to Matthew , although his interpretation of the “ young man ” of his Marcan source ( Mk 16:5 ) as an angel is probably true to Mark ’ s intention ; cf . Lk 24:23 where the “ two men ” of Mt 24:4 are said to be “ angels. ” Rolled back the stone…upon it : not to allow the risen Jesus to leave the tomb but to make evident that the tomb is empty ( see Mt 24:6 ) . Unlike the apocryphal Gospel of Peter ( 9:35—11:44 ) , the New Testament does not describe the resurrection of Jesus , nor is there anyone who sees it . His appearance was like lightning…snow : see note on Mt 17:2 . - 28:6–7 Cf . Mk 16:6–7 . Just as he said : a Matthean addition referring to Jesus ’ predictions of his resurrection , e.g. , Mt 16:21 ; 17:23 ; 20:19 . Tell his disciples : like the angel of the Lord of the infancy narrative , the angel interprets a fact and gives a commandment about what is to be done ; cf . Mt 1:20–21 . Matthew omits Mark ’ s “ and Peter ” ( Mk 16:7 ) ; considering his interest in Peter , this omission is curious .

His sustained obedience brings forth the new Israel of God there where Israel ’ s rebellion had brought death and alienation . - 1:14–15 After John had been arrested : in the plan of God , Jesus was not to proclaim the good news of salvation prior to the termination of the Baptist ’ s active mission . Galilee : in the Marcan account , scene of the major part of Jesus ’ public ministry before his arrest and condemnation .

See notes on Mt 4:18–22 and Mt 4:20 . - 1:21–45 The account of a single day ’ s ministry of Jesus on a sabbath in and outside the synagogue of Capernaum ( Mk 1:21–31 ) combines teaching and miracles of exorcism and healing . Mention is not made of the content of the teaching but of the effect of astonishment and alarm on the people . Jesus ’ teaching with authority , making an absolute claim on the hearer , was in the best tradition of the ancient prophets , not of the scribes . The narrative continues with events that evening ( Mk 1:32–34 ; see notes on Mt 8:14–17 ) and the next day ( Mk 1:35–39 ) . The cleansing in Mk 1:40–45 stands as an isolated story . - 1:23 An unclean spirit : so called because of the spirit ’ s resistance to the holiness of God . The spirit knows and fears the power of Jesus to destroy his influence ; cf . Mk 1:32 ,

NABRE	Mark	1	3	) the temptation of Jesus by Satan ( Mk 1:12–13 ) . - 1:1 The gospel of Jesus Christ [ the Son of God ] : the “ good news ” of salvation in and through Jesus , crucified and risen , acknowledged by the Christian community as Messiah ( Mk 8:29 ; 14:61–62 ) and Son of God ( Mk 1:11 ; 9:7 ; 15:39 ) , although some important manuscripts here omit the Son of God . - 1:2–3 Although Mark attributes the prophecy to Isaiah , the text is a combination of Mal 3:1 ; Is 40:3 ; Ex 23:20 ; cf . Mt 11:10 ; Lk 7:27 . John ’ s ministry is seen as God ’ s prelude to the saving mission of his Son . The way of the Lord : this prophecy of Deutero-Isaiah concerning the end of the Babylonian exile is here applied to the coming of Jesus ; John the Baptist is to prepare the way for him . - 1:6 Clothed in camel ’ s hair…waist : the Baptist ’ s garb recalls that of Elijah in
NABRE	Mark	1	4	John [ the ] Baptist appeared in the desert proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins .
NABRE	Mark	1	5	People of the whole Judean countryside and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the Jordan River as they acknowledged their sins .
NABRE	Mark	1	6	John was clothed in camel ’ s hair , with a leather belt around his waist . [ d ] He fed on locusts and wild honey .
NABRE	Mark	1	7	And this is what he proclaimed : “ One mightier than I is coming after me . I am not worthy to stoop and loosen the thongs of his sandals .
NABRE	Mark	1	8	[ e ] ( D ) I have baptized you with water ; he will baptize you with the holy Spirit. ” The Baptism of Jesus .
NABRE	Mark	1	9	( E ) It happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John .
NABRE	Mark	1	10	On coming up out of the water he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit , like a dove , descending upon him . [ f ]
NABRE	Mark	1	11	( F ) And a voice came from the heavens , “ You are my beloved Son ; with you I am well pleased. ” The Temptation of Jesus . [ g ]
NABRE	Mark	1	12	At once the Spirit drove him out into the desert , ( G )
NABRE	Mark	1	13	and he remained in the desert for forty days , tempted by Satan . He was among wild beasts , and the angels ministered to him . II . The Mystery of Jesus The Beginning of the Galilean Ministry .
NABRE	Mark	1	14	( H ) After John had been arrested , [ h ] Jesus came to Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God :
NABRE	Mark	1	15	( I ) “ This is the time of fulfillment . The kingdom of God is at hand . Repent , and believe in the gospel. ” The Call of the First Disciples . [ i ]
NABRE	Mark	1	16	( J ) As he passed by the Sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting their nets into the sea ; they were fishermen .
NABRE	Mark	1	17	Jesus said to them , “ Come after me , and I will make you fishers of men. ”
NABRE	Mark	1	18	Then they abandoned their nets and followed him .
NABRE	Mark	1	19	He walked along a little farther and saw James , the son of Zebedee , and his brother John . They too were in a boat mending their nets .
NABRE	Mark	1	20	Then he called them . So they left their father Zebedee in the boat along with the hired men and followed him . The Cure of a Demoniac .
NABRE	Mark	1	21	[ j ] ( K ) Then they came to Capernaum , and on the sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught .
NABRE	Mark	1	22	( L ) The people were astonished at his teaching , for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes .
NABRE	Mark	1	23	[ k ] In their synagogue was a man with an unclean spirit ;
NABRE	Mark	1	24	[ l ] he cried out , “ What have you to do with us , [ m ] Jesus of Nazareth ? Have you come to destroy us ? I know who you are—the Holy One of God ! ”
NABRE	Mark	1	25	Jesus rebuked him and said , “ Quiet ! Come out of him ! ”
NABRE	Mark	1	26	The unclean spirit convulsed him and with a loud cry came out of him .
NABRE	Mark	1	27	All were amazed and asked one another , “ What is this ? A new teaching with authority . He commands even the unclean spirits and they obey him. ”
NABRE	Mark	1	28	His fame spread everywhere throughout the whole region of Galilee . The Cure of Simon ’ s Mother-in-Law .
NABRE	Mark	1	29	( M ) On leaving the synagogue he entered the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John .
NABRE	Mark	1	30	Simon ’ s mother-in-law lay sick with a fever . They immediately told him about her .
NABRE	Mark	1	31	He approached , grasped her hand , and helped her up . Then the fever left her and she waited on them . Other Healings .
NABRE	Mark	1	32	When it was evening , after sunset , they brought to him all who were ill or possessed by demons .
NABRE	Mark	1	33	The whole town was gathered at the door .
NABRE	Mark	1	34	; 3:11 ; 6:13 . - 1:24–25 The Holy One of God : not a confession but an attempt to ward off Jesus ’ power , reflecting the notion that use of the precise name of an opposing spirit would guarantee mastery over him . Jesus silenced the cry of the unclean spirit and drove him out of the man . - 1:24 What have you to do with us ? : see note on Jn 2:4 . - 1:40 A leper : for the various forms of skin disease , see Lv 13:1–50 and the note on Lv 13:2–4 . There are only two instances in the Old Testament in which God is shown to have cured a leper ( Nm 12:10–15 ;
NABRE	Mark	1	35	( N ) Rising very early before dawn , he left and went off to a deserted place , where he prayed .
NABRE	Mark	1	36	Simon and those who were with him pursued him
NABRE	Mark	1	37	and on finding him said , “ Everyone is looking for you. ”
NABRE	Mark	1	38	He told them , “ Let us go on to the nearby villages that I may preach there also . For this purpose have I come. ”
NABRE	Mark	1	39	So he went into their synagogues , preaching and driving out demons throughout the whole of Galilee . The Cleansing of a Leper .
NABRE	Mark	1	40	( O ) A leper [ n ] came to him [ and kneeling down ] begged him and said , “ If you wish , you can make me clean. ”
NABRE	Mark	1	41	Moved with pity , he stretched out his hand , touched him , and said to him , “ I do will it . Be made clean. ” ( P )
NABRE	Mark	1	42	The leprosy left him immediately , and he was made clean . ( Q )
NABRE	Mark	1	43	Then , warning him sternly , he dismissed him at once .
NABRE	Mark	1	44	Then he said to him , “ See that you tell no one anything , but go , show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses prescribed ; that will be proof for them. ” ( R )
NABRE	Mark	1	45	The man went away and began to publicize the whole matter . He spread the report abroad so that it was impossible for Jesus to enter a town openly . He remained outside in deserted places , and people kept coming to him from everywhere .

NABRE	Mark	2	3	They came bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men .
NABRE	Mark	2	4	Unable to get near Jesus because of the crowd , they opened up the roof above him . After they had broken through , they let down the mat on which the paralytic was lying .
NABRE	Mark	2	5	[ c ] When Jesus saw their faith , he said to the paralytic , “ Child , your sins are forgiven. ”
NABRE	Mark	2	6	[ d ] Now some of the scribes were sitting there asking themselves ,
NABRE	Mark	2	7	“ Why does this man speak that way ? [ e ] He is blaspheming . Who but God alone can forgive sins ? ” ( B )
NABRE	Mark	2	8	Jesus immediately knew in his mind what they were thinking to themselves , so he said , “ Why are you thinking such things in your hearts ?
NABRE	Mark	2	9	Which is easier , to say to the paralytic , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise , pick up your mat and walk ’ ?
NABRE	Mark	2	10	[ f ] But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins on earth ” —
NABRE	Mark	2	11	he said to the paralytic , “ I say to you , rise , pick up your mat , and go home. ”
NABRE	Mark	2	12	He rose , picked up his mat at once , and went away in the sight of everyone . They were all astounded and glorified God , saying , “ We have never seen anything like this. ” The Call of Levi .
NABRE	Mark	2	13	[ g ] ( C ) Once again he went out along the sea . All the crowd came to him and he taught them .
NABRE	Mark	2	14	( D ) As he passed by , [ h ] he saw Levi , son of Alphaeus , sitting at the customs post . He said to him , “ Follow me. ” And he got up and followed him .
NABRE	Mark	2	15	While he was at table in his house , [ i ] many tax collectors and sinners sat with Jesus and his disciples ; for there were many who followed him .
NABRE	Mark	2	16	[ j ] Some scribes who were Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors and said to his disciples , “ Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
NABRE	Mark	2	17	Jesus heard this and said to them [ that ] , “ Those who are well do not need a physician , [ k ] but the sick do . I did not come to call the righteous but sinners. ” The Question About Fasting . [ l ]
NABRE	Mark	2	18	The disciples of John and of the Pharisees were accustomed to fast . ( E ) People came to him and objected , “ Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast , but your disciples do not fast ? ”
NABRE	Mark	2	19	Jesus answered them , “ Can the wedding guests fast [ m ] while the bridegroom is with them ? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they can not fast .
NABRE	Mark	2	20	But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them , and then they will fast on that day .
NABRE	Mark	2	21	No one sews a piece of unshrunken cloth on an old cloak . If he does , its fullness pulls away , the new from the old , and the tear gets worse .
NABRE	Mark	2	22	Likewise , no one pours new wine into old wineskins . Otherwise , the wine will burst the skins , and both the wine and the skins are ruined . Rather , new wine is poured into fresh wineskins. ” The Disciples and the Sabbath . [ n ]
NABRE	Mark	2	23	As he was passing through a field of grain on the sabbath , his disciples began to make a path while picking the heads of grain . ( F )
NABRE	Mark	2	24	At this the Pharisees said to him , “ Look , why are they doing what is unlawful on the sabbath ? ” ( G )
NABRE	Mark	2	25	He said to them , “ Have you never read what David did [ o ] when he was in need and he and his companions were hungry ?
NABRE	Mark	2	26	How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the bread of offering that only the priests could lawfully eat , and shared it with his companions ? ” ( H )
NABRE	Mark	2	27	Then he said to them , “ The sabbath was made for man , [ p ] not man for the sabbath . ( I )
NABRE	Mark	2	28	[ q ] That is why the Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath. ” Footnotes - 2:1–3:6 This section relates a series of conflicts between Jesus and the scribes and Pharisees in which the growing opposition of the latter leads to their plot to put Jesus to death ( Mk 3:6 ) . - 2:1–2 He was at home : to the crowds that gathered in and outside the house Jesus preached the word , i.e. , the gospel concerning the nearness of the kingdom and the necessity of repentance and faith ( Mk 1:14 ) . - 2:5 It was the faith of the paralytic and those who carried him that moved Jesus to heal the sick man . Accounts of other miracles of Jesus reveal more and more his emphasis on faith as the requisite for exercising his healing powers ( Mk 5:34 ; 9:23–24 ; 10:52 ) . - 2:6 Scribes : trained in oral interpretation of the written law ; in Mark ’ s gospel , adversaries of Jesus , with one exception ( Mk 12:28 ,
NABRE	Mark	2	34	) . - 2:7 He is blaspheming : an accusation made here and repeated during the trial of Jesus ( Mk 14:60–64 ) . - 2:10 But that you may know that the Son of Man…on earth : although Mk 2:8–9 are addressed to the scribes , the sudden interruption of thought and structure in Mk 2:10 seems not addressed to them nor to the paralytic . Moreover , the early public use of the designation “ Son of Man ” to unbelieving scribes is most unlikely . The most probable explanation is that Mark ’ s insertion of Mk 2:10 is a commentary addressed to Christians for whom he recalls this miracle and who already accept in faith that Jesus is Messiah and Son of God . - 2:13 He taught them : see note on Mk 1:21–45 . - 2:14 As he passed by : see note on Mk 1:16–20 . Levi , son of Alphaeus : see note on Mt 9:9 . Customs post : such tax collectors paid a fixed sum for the right to collect customs duties within their districts . Since whatever they could collect above this amount constituted their profit , the abuse of extortion was widespread among them . Hence , Jewish customs officials were regarded as sinners ( Mk 2:16 ) , outcasts of society , and disgraced along with their families . He got up and followed him : i.e. , became a disciple of Jesus . - 2:15 In his house : cf . Mk 2:1 ; Mt 9:10 . Lk 5:29 clearly calls it Levi ’ s house . - 2:16–17 This and the following conflict stories reflect a similar pattern : a statement of fact , a question of protest , and a reply by Jesus . - 2:17 Do not need a physician : this maxim of Jesus with its implied irony was uttered to silence his adversaries who objected that he ate with tax collectors and sinners ( Mk 2:16 ) . Because the scribes and Pharisees were self-righteous , they were not capable of responding to Jesus ’ call to repentance and faith in the gospel . - 2:18–22 This conflict over the question of fasting has the same pattern as Mk 2:16–17 ; see notes on Mt 9:15 ; 9:16–17 . - 2:19 Can the wedding guests fast ? : the bridal metaphor expresses a new relationship of love between God and his people in the person and mission of Jesus to his disciples . It is the inauguration of the new and joyful messianic time of fulfillment and the passing of the old . Any attempt at assimilating the Pharisaic practice of fasting , or of extending the preparatory discipline of John ’ s disciples beyond the arrival of the bridegroom , would be as futile as sewing a piece of unshrunken cloth on an old cloak or pouring new wine into old wineskins with the resulting destruction of both cloth and wine ( Mk 2:21–22 ) . Fasting is rendered superfluous during the earthly ministry of Jesus ; cf . Mk 2:20 . - 2:23–28 This conflict regarding the sabbath follows the same pattern as in Mk 2:18–22 . - 2:25–26 Have you never read what David did ? : Jesus defends the action of his disciples on the basis of

NABRE	Mark	3	15	and to have authority to drive out demons :
NABRE	Mark	3	16	[ g ] [ he appointed the twelve : ] Simon , whom he named Peter ;

NABRE	Mark	3	18	Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Matthew , Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus ; Thaddeus , Simon the Cananean ,
NABRE	Mark	3	19	and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him . Blasphemy of the Scribes .
NABRE	Mark	3	20	[ h ] He came home . [ i ] Again [ the ] crowd gathered , making it impossible for them even to eat . ( I )
NABRE	Mark	3	21	When his relatives heard of this they set out to seize him , for they said , “ He is out of his mind. ” ( J )
NABRE	Mark	3	22	The scribes who had come from Jerusalem said , “ He is possessed by Beelzebul , ” [ j ] and “ By the prince of demons he drives out demons. ” ( K ) Jesus and Beelzebul .
NABRE	Mark	3	23	Summoning them , he began to speak to them in parables , “ How can Satan drive out Satan ?
NABRE	Mark	3	24	If a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom can not stand .
NABRE	Mark	3	25	And if a house is divided against itself , that house will not be able to stand .
NABRE	Mark	3	26	And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided , he can not stand ; that is the end of him .

NABRE	Mark	3	31	( M ) His mother and his brothers arrived . Standing outside they sent word to him and called him .
NABRE	Mark	3	32	A crowd seated around him told him , “ Your mother and your brothers [ l ] [ and your sisters ] are outside asking for you. ”
NABRE	Mark	3	33	But he said to them in reply , “ Who are my mother and [ my ] brothers ? ”
NABRE	Mark	3	34	And looking around at those seated in the circle he said , “ Here are my mother and my brothers .
NABRE	Mark	3	35	[ For ] whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother. ” Footnotes - 3:1–5 Here Jesus is again depicted in conflict with his adversaries over the question of sabbath-day observance . His opponents were already ill disposed toward him because they regarded Jesus as a violator of the sabbath . Jesus ’ question Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath rather than to do evil ? places the matter in the broader theological context outside the casuistry of the scribes . The answer is obvious . Jesus heals the man with the withered hand in the sight of all and reduces his opponents to silence ; cf . Jn 5:17–18 . - 3:6 In reporting the plot of the Pharisees and Herodians to put Jesus to death after this series of conflicts in Galilee , Mark uses a pattern that recurs in his account of later controversies in Jerusalem ( Mk 11:17–18 ; 12:13–17 ) . The help of the Herodians , supporters of Herod Antipas , tetrarch of Galilee and Perea , is needed to take action against Jesus . Both series of conflicts point to their gravity and to the impending passion of Jesus . - 3:7–19 This overview of the Galilean ministry manifests the power of Jesus to draw people to himself through his teaching and deeds of power . The crowds of Jews from many regions surround Jesus ( Mk 3:7–12 ) . This phenomenon prepares the way for creating a new people of Israel . The choice and mission of the Twelve is the prelude ( Mk 3:13–19 ) . - 3:11–12 See note on Mk 1:24–25 . - 3:13 He went up the mountain : here and elsewhere the mountain is associated with solemn moments and acts in the mission and self-revelation of Jesus ( Mk 6:46 ; 9:2–8 ; 13:3 ) . Jesus acts with authority as he summoned those whom he wanted and they came to him . - 3:14–15 He appointed twelve [ whom he also named apostles ] that they might be with him : literally “ he made , ” i.e. , instituted them as apostles to extend his messianic mission through them ( Mk 6:7–13 ) . See notes on Mt 10:1 and 10:2–4 . - 3:16 Simon , whom he named Peter : Mark indicates that Simon ’ s name was changed on this occasion . Peter is first in all lists of the apostles ( Mt 10:2 ; Lk 6:14 ; Acts 1:13 ; cf .

NABRE	Mark	4	4	And as he sowed , some seed fell on the path , and the birds came and ate it up .
NABRE	Mark	4	1	[ a ] On another occasion ( A ) he began to teach by the sea . [ b ] A very large crowd gathered around him so that he got into a boat on the sea and sat down . And the whole crowd was beside the sea on land . ( B )
NABRE	Mark	4	2	And he taught them at length in parables , and in the course of his instruction he said to them ,
NABRE	Mark	4	3	[ c ] “ Hear this ! A sower went out to sow .
NABRE	Mark	4	5	Other seed fell on rocky ground where it had little soil . It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep .
NABRE	Mark	4	6	And when the sun rose , it was scorched and it withered for lack of roots .
NABRE	Mark	4	7	Some seed fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up and choked it and it produced no grain .
NABRE	Mark	4	8	And some seed fell on rich soil and produced fruit . It came up and grew and yielded thirty , sixty , and a hundredfold. ”
NABRE	Mark	4	9	He added , “ Whoever has ears to hear ought to hear. ” The Purpose of the Parables .
NABRE	Mark	4	10	And when he was alone , those present along with the Twelve questioned him about the parables .
NABRE	Mark	4	11	[ d ] He answered them , “ The mystery of the kingdom of God has been granted to you . But to those outside everything comes in parables ,
NABRE	Mark	4	12	) as compared with the interpretation of the parables he gives to his disciples ( Mk 4:10–25 , 33–34 ) to each group according to its capacity to understand ( Mk 4:9–11 ) . The key feature of the parable at hand is the sowing of the seed ( Mk 4:3 ) , representing the breakthrough of the kingdom of God into the world . The various types of soil refer to the diversity of response accorded the word of God ( Mk 4:4–7 ) . The climax of the parable is the harvest of thirty , sixty , and a hundredfold , indicating the consummation of the kingdom ( Mk 4:8 ) . Thus both the present and the future action of God , from the initiation to the fulfillment of the kingdom , is presented through this and other parables ( Mk 4:26–29 , 30–32 ) . - 4:1 By the sea : the shore of the Sea of Galilee or a boat near the shore ( Mk 2:13 ; 3:7–8 ) is the place where Mark depicts Jesus teaching the crowds . By contrast the mountain is the scene of Jesus at prayer ( Mk 6:46 ) or in the process of forming his disciples ( Mk 3:13 ; 9:2 ) . - 4:3–8 See note on Mt 13:3–8 . - 4:11–12 These verses are to be viewed against their background in Mk 3:6 ,
NABRE	Mark	4	13	[ e ] Jesus said to them , “ Do you not understand this parable ? ( D ) Then how will you understand any of the parables ?
NABRE	Mark	4	14	The sower sows the word .
NABRE	Mark	4	15	These are the ones on the path where the word is sown . As soon as they hear , Satan comes at once and takes away the word sown in them .
NABRE	Mark	4	16	And these are the ones sown on rocky ground who , when they hear the word , receive it at once with joy .
NABRE	Mark	4	17	But they have no root ; they last only for a time . Then when tribulation or persecution comes because of the word , they quickly fall away .
NABRE	Mark	4	18	Those sown among thorns are another sort . They are the people who hear the word ,
NABRE	Mark	4	19	but worldly anxiety , the lure of riches , and the craving for other things intrude and choke the word , and it bears no fruit .
NABRE	Mark	4	20	But those sown on rich soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit thirty and sixty and a hundredfold. ” Parable of the Lamp .
NABRE	Mark	4	21	( E ) He said to them , “ Is a lamp brought in to be placed under a bushel basket or under a bed , and not to be placed on a lampstand ? ( F )
NABRE	Mark	4	22	concerning the unbelief and opposition Jesus encountered in his ministry . It is against this background that the distinction in Jesus ’ method becomes clear of presenting the kingdom to the disbelieving crowd in one manner and to the disciples in another . To the former it is presented in parables and the truth remains hidden ; for the latter the parable is interpreted and the mystery is partially revealed because of their faith ; see notes on Mt 13:11 and Mt 13:13 . - 4:13–20 See note on Mt 13:18–23 . - 4:26–29 Only Mark records the parable of the seed ’ s growth . Sower and harvester are the same . The emphasis is on the power of the seed to grow of itself without human intervention ( Mk 4:27 ) . Mysteriously it produces blade and ear and full grain ( Mk 4:28 ) . Thus the kingdom of God initiated by Jesus in proclaiming the word develops quietly yet powerfully until it is fully established by him at the final judgment ( Mk 4:29 ) ; cf . Rev 14:15 . - 4:32 The universality of the kingdom of God is indicated here ; cf . Ez 17:23 ; 31:6 ; Dn 4:17–19 . - 4:35–5:43 After the chapter on parables , Mark narrates four miracle stories : Mk 4:35–41 ; 5:1–20 ; and two joined together in Mk 5:21–43 . See also notes on Mt 8:23–34 and 9:8–26 . - 4:39 Quiet ! Be still ! : as in the case of silencing a demon ( Mk 1:25 ) , Jesus rebukes the wind and subdues the turbulence of the sea by a mere word ; see note on Mt 8:26 . - 4:41 Jesus is here depicted as exercising power over wind and sea . In the Christian community this event was seen as a sign of Jesus ’ saving presence amid persecutions that threatened its existence .

NABRE	Mark	4	23	Anyone who has ears to hear ought to hear. ”
NABRE	Mark	4	24	He also told them , “ Take care what you hear . The measure with which you measure will be measured out to you , and still more will be given to you . ( H )
NABRE	Mark	4	25	To the one who has , more will be given ; from the one who has not , even what he has will be taken away. ” ( I ) Seed Grows of Itself .
NABRE	Mark	4	26	He said , “ This is how it is with the kingdom of God ; [ f ] it is as if a man were to scatter seed ( J ) on the land
NABRE	Mark	4	27	and would sleep and rise night and day and the seed would sprout and grow , he knows not how .
NABRE	Mark	4	28	Of its own accord the land yields fruit , first the blade , then the ear , then the full grain in the ear .
NABRE	Mark	4	29	And when the grain is ripe , he wields the sickle at once , for the harvest has come. ” The Mustard Seed .
NABRE	Mark	4	30	( K ) He said , “ To what shall we compare the kingdom of God , or what parable can we use for it ?
NABRE	Mark	4	31	It is like a mustard seed that , when it is sown in the ground , is the smallest of all the seeds on the earth .
NABRE	Mark	4	32	[ g ] But once it is sown , it springs up and becomes the largest of plants and puts forth large branches , so that the birds of the sky can dwell in its shade. ”
NABRE	Mark	4	33	With many such parables ( L ) he spoke the word to them as they were able to understand it .
NABRE	Mark	4	34	Without parables he did not speak to them , but to his own disciples he explained everything in private . The Calming of a Storm at Sea .
NABRE	Mark	4	35	[ h ] On that day , as evening drew on , he said to them , “ Let us cross to the other side. ” ( M )
NABRE	Mark	4	36	Leaving the crowd , they took him with them in the boat just as he was . And other boats were with him .
NABRE	Mark	4	37	A violent squall came up and waves were breaking over the boat , so that it was already filling up .
NABRE	Mark	4	38	Jesus was in the stern , asleep on a cushion . They woke him and said to him , “ Teacher , do you not care that we are perishing ? ”
NABRE	Mark	4	39	He woke up , rebuked the wind , and said to the sea , “ Quiet ! Be still ! ” [ i ] The wind ceased and there was great calm .
NABRE	Mark	4	40	Then he asked them , “ Why are you terrified ? Do you not yet have faith ? ”
NABRE	Mark	4	41	[ j ] ( N ) They were filled with great awe and said to one another , “ Who then is this whom even wind and sea obey ? ” Footnotes - 4:1–34 In parables ( Mk 4:2 ) : see note on Mt 13:3 . The use of parables is typical of Jesus ’ enigmatic method of teaching the crowds ( Mk 4:2–9 ,

NABRE	Mark	5	3	The man had been dwelling among the tombs , and no one could restrain him any longer , even with a chain .
NABRE	Mark	5	4	In fact , he had frequently been bound with shackles and chains , but the chains had been pulled apart by him and the shackles smashed , and no one was strong enough to subdue him .
NABRE	Mark	5	6	Catching sight of Jesus from a distance , he ran up and prostrated himself before him ,
NABRE	Mark	5	7	crying out in a loud voice , “ What have you to do with me , [ c ] Jesus , Son of the Most High God ? I adjure you by God , do not torment me ! ”
NABRE	Mark	5	8	( He had been saying to him , “ Unclean spirit , come out of the man ! ” )
NABRE	Mark	5	9	[ d ] He asked him , “ What is your name ? ” He replied , “ Legion is my name . There are many of us. ” ( B )

Mk 1:24 and see note on Jn 2:4 . - 5:9 Legion is my name : the demons were numerous and the condition of the possessed man was extremely serious ; cf . Mt 12:45 . - 5:11 Herd of swine : see note on Mt 8:30 . - 5:19 Go home : Jesus did not accept the man ’ s request to remain with him as a disciple ( Mk 5:18 ) , yet invited him to announce to his own people what the Lord had done for him , i.e. , proclaim the gospel message to his pagan family ; cf . Mk 1:14 ,
NABRE	Mark	5	14	The swineherds ran away and reported the incident in the town and throughout the countryside . And people came out to see what had happened .
NABRE	Mark	5	15	As they approached Jesus , they caught sight of the man who had been possessed by Legion , sitting there clothed and in his right mind . And they were seized with fear .

NABRE	Mark	5	17	Then they began to beg him to leave their district .
NABRE	Mark	5	18	As he was getting into the boat , the man who had been possessed pleaded to remain with him .
NABRE	Mark	5	19	But he would not permit him but told him instead , “ Go home [ f ] to your family and announce to them all that the Lord in his pity has done for you. ”
NABRE	Mark	5	20	Then the man went off and began to proclaim in the Decapolis what Jesus had done for him ; and all were amazed . Jairus ’ s Daughter and the Woman with a Hemorrhage . [ g ]
NABRE	Mark	5	21	When Jesus had crossed again [ in the boat ] to the other side , a large crowd gathered around him , and he stayed close to the sea . ( C )
NABRE	Mark	5	22	One of the synagogue officials , named Jairus , came forward . ( D ) Seeing him he fell at his feet
NABRE	Mark	5	23	and pleaded earnestly with him , saying , “ My daughter is at the point of death . Please , come lay your hands on her [ h ] that she may get well and live. ”
NABRE	Mark	5	24	He went off with him , and a large crowd followed him and pressed upon him .
NABRE	Mark	5	25	There was a woman afflicted with hemorrhages for twelve years .
NABRE	Mark	5	26	She had suffered greatly at the hands of many doctors and had spent all that she had . Yet she was not helped but only grew worse .
NABRE	Mark	5	27	She had heard about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak .
NABRE	Mark	5	28	[ i ] She said , “ If I but touch his clothes , I shall be cured. ”
NABRE	Mark	5	29	Immediately her flow of blood dried up . She felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction .
NABRE	Mark	5	30	Jesus , aware at once that power had gone out from him , turned around in the crowd and asked , “ Who has touched my clothes ? ”
NABRE	Mark	5	31	But his disciples said to him , “ You see how the crowd is pressing upon you , and yet you ask , ‘ Who touched me ? ’ ”
NABRE	Mark	5	32	And he looked around to see who had done it .
NABRE	Mark	5	33	The woman , realizing what had happened to her , approached in fear and trembling . She fell down before Jesus and told him the whole truth .
NABRE	Mark	5	34	He said to her , “ Daughter , your faith has saved you . Go in peace and be cured of your affliction. ” ( E )
NABRE	Mark	5	35	[ j ] While he was still speaking , people from the synagogue official ’ s house arrived and said , “ Your daughter has died ; why trouble the teacher any longer ? ”
NABRE	Mark	5	36	Disregarding the message that was reported , Jesus said to the synagogue official , “ Do not be afraid ; just have faith. ”
NABRE	Mark	5	37	He did not allow anyone to accompany him inside except Peter , James , and John , the brother of James .
NABRE	Mark	5	38	When they arrived at the house of the synagogue official , he caught sight of a commotion , people weeping and wailing loudly .
NABRE	Mark	5	39	; 3:14 ; 13:10 . - 5:21–43 The story of the raising to life of Jairus ’ s daughter is divided into two parts : Mk 5:21–24 ; 5:35–43 . Between these two separated parts the account of the cure of the hemorrhage victim ( Mk 5:25–34 ) is interposed . This technique of intercalating or sandwiching one story within another occurs several times in Mk 3:19b–21 ; 3:22–30 3:31–35 ; 6:6b–13 ; 6:14–29 ; 6:30 ; 11:12–14 ; 11:15–19 ; 11:20–25 ; 14:53 ; 14:54 ; 14:55–65 ; 14:66–73 . - 5:23 Lay your hands on her : this act for the purpose of healing is frequent in Mk 6:5 ; 7:32–35 ; 8:23–25 ; 16:18 and is also found in Mt 9:18 ; Lk 4:40 ; 13:13 ; Acts 9:17 ; 28:8 . - 5:28 Both in the case of Jairus and his daughter ( Mk 5:23 ) and in the case of the hemorrhage victim , the inner conviction that physical contact ( Mk 5:30 ) accompanied by faith in Jesus ’ saving power could effect a cure was rewarded . - 5:35 The faith of Jairus was put to a twofold test : (
NABRE	Mark	5	40	And they ridiculed him . Then he put them all out . He took along the child ’ s father and mother and those who were with him and entered the room where the child was .
NABRE	Mark	5	41	[ l ] He took the child by the hand and said to her , “ Talitha koum , ” which means , “ Little girl , I say to you , arise ! ”
NABRE	Mark	5	42	The girl , a child of twelve , arose immediately and walked around . [ At that ] they were utterly astounded .
NABRE	Mark	5	43	He gave strict orders that no one should know this and said that she should be given something to eat .

NABRE	Mark	6	1	) of the first disciples to be fishers of men ( Mk 1:16–20 ) , (
NABRE	Mark	6	2	) then of the Twelve set apart to be with Jesus and to receive authority to preach and expel demons ( Mk 3:13–19 ) . Now they are given the specific mission to exercise that authority in word and power as representatives of Jesus during the time of their formation . - 6:8–9 In Mark the use of a walking stick ( Mk 6:8 ) and sandals ( Mk 6:9 ) is permitted , but not in Mt 10:10 nor in Lk 10:4 . Mark does not mention any prohibition to visit pagan territory and to enter Samaritan towns . These differences indicate a certain adaptation to conditions in and outside of Palestine and suggest in Mark ’ s account a later activity in the church . For the rest , Jesus required of his apostles a total dependence on God for food and shelter ; cf . Mk 6:35–44 ; 8:1–9 . - 6:10–11 Remaining in the same house as a guest ( Mk 6:10 ) rather than moving to another offering greater comfort avoided any impression of seeking advantage for oneself and prevented dishonor to one ’ s host . Shaking the dust off one ’ s feet served as testimony against those who rejected the call to repentance . - 6:13 Anointed with oil…cured them : a common medicinal remedy , but seen here as a vehicle of divine power for healing . - 6:14–16 The various opinions about Jesus anticipate the theme of his identity that reaches its climax in Mk 8:27–30 . - 6:14 King Herod : see note on Mt 14:1 . - 6:17–29 Similarities are to be noted between Mark ’ s account of the imprisonment and death of John the Baptist in this pericope , and that of the passion of Jesus ( Mk 15:1–47 ) . Herod and Pilate , each in turn , acknowledges the holiness of life of one over whom he unjustly exercises the power of condemnation and death ( Mk 6:26–27 ; 15:9–10 , 14–15 ) . The hatred of Herodias toward John parallels that of the Jewish leaders toward Jesus . After the deaths of John and of Jesus , well-disposed persons request the bodies of the victims of Herod and of Pilate in turn to give them respectful burial ( Mk 6:29 ; 15:45–46 ) . - 6:19 Herodias : see note on Mt 14:3 . - 6:30 Apostles : here , and in some manuscripts at Mk 3:14 , Mark calls apostles ( i.e. , those sent forth ) the Twelve whom Jesus sends as his emissaries , empowering them to preach , to expel demons , and to cure the sick ( Mk 6:13 ) . Only after Pentecost is the title used in the technical sense . - 6:31–34 The withdrawal of Jesus with his disciples to a desert place to rest attracts a great number of people to follow them . Toward this people of the new exodus Jesus is moved with pity ; he satisfies their spiritual hunger by teaching them many things , thus gradually showing himself the faithful shepherd of a new Israel ; cf . Nm 27:17 ; Ez 34:15 . - 6:35–44 See note on Mt 14:13–21 . Compare this section with Mk 8:1–9 . The various accounts of the multiplication of loaves and fishes , two each in Mark and in Matthew and one each in Luke and in John , indicate the wide interest of the early church in their eucharistic gatherings ; see , e.g. , Mk 6:41 ; 8:6 ; 14:22 ; and recall also the sign of bread in Ex

NABRE	Mark	6	4	[ d ] ( C ) Jesus said to them , “ A prophet is not without honor except in his native place and among his own kin and in his own house. ”
NABRE	Mark	6	5	. The question of meaning here would not have arisen but for the faith of the church in Mary ’ s perpetual virginity . - 6:4 A prophet is not without honor except…in his own house : a saying that finds parallels in other literatures , especially Jewish and Greek , but without reference to a prophet . Comparing himself to previous Hebrew prophets whom the people rejected , Jesus intimates his own eventual rejection by the nation especially in view of the dishonor his own relatives had shown him ( Mk 3:21 ) and now his townspeople as well . - 6:5 He was not able to perform any mighty deed there : according to Mark , Jesus ’ power could not take effect because of a person ’ s lack of faith . - 6:7–13 The preparation for the mission of the Twelve is seen in the call (
NABRE	Mark	6	7	( D ) He summoned the Twelve [ f ] and began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over unclean spirits .

The brother of James…Simon : in Semitic usage , the terms “ brother , ” “ sister ” are applied not only to children of the same parents , but to nephews , nieces , cousins , half-brothers , and half-sisters ; cf . Gn 14:16 ; 29:15 ; Lv 10:4 . While one can not suppose that the meaning of a Greek word should be sought in the first place from Semitic usage , the Septuagint often translates the Hebrew ’ āh by the Greek word adelphos , “ brother , ” as in the cited passages , a fact that may argue for a similar breadth of meaning in some New Testament passages . For instance , there is no doubt that in v

Some witnesses have “ the carpenter ’ s son , ” as in Mt 13:55 . Son of Mary : contrary to Jewish custom , which calls a man the son of his father , this expression may reflect Mark ’ s own faith that God is the Father of Jesus ( Mk 1:1 ,

NABRE	Mark	7	7	In vain do they worship me , teaching as doctrines human precepts. ’
NABRE	Mark	7	1	Now when the Pharisees with some scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him , ( A )
NABRE	Mark	7	2	they observed that some of his disciples ate their meals with unclean , that is , unwashed , hands .
NABRE	Mark	7	3	( For the Pharisees and , in fact , all Jews , do not eat without carefully washing their hands , [ b ] keeping the tradition of the elders .
NABRE	Mark	7	4	And on coming from the marketplace they do not eat without purifying themselves . And there are many other things that they have traditionally observed , the purification of cups and jugs and kettles [ and beds ] . )
NABRE	Mark	7	5	So the Pharisees and scribes questioned him , “ Why do your disciples not follow the tradition of the elders [ c ] but instead eat a meal with unclean hands ? ”
NABRE	Mark	7	6	He responded , “ Well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites , as it is written : ( B ) ‘ This people honors me with their lips , but their hearts are far from me ;
NABRE	Mark	7	8	You disregard God ’ s commandment but cling to human tradition. ”
NABRE	Mark	7	9	He went on to say , “ How well you have set aside the commandment of God in order to uphold your tradition !
NABRE	Mark	7	10	For Moses said , ‘ Honor your father and your mother , ’ and ‘ Whoever curses father or mother shall die. ’ ( C )
NABRE	Mark	7	11	Yet you say , ‘ If a person says to father or mother , “ Any support you might have had from me is qorban ” ’ [ d ] ( meaning , dedicated to God ) ,
NABRE	Mark	7	12	you allow him to do nothing more for his father or mother .
NABRE	Mark	7	13	You nullify the word of God in favor of your tradition that you have handed on . And you do many such things. ”
NABRE	Mark	7	14	( D ) He summoned the crowd again and said to them , “ Hear me , all of you , and understand .
NABRE	Mark	7	15	Nothing that enters one from outside can defile that person ; but the things that come out from within are what defile. ” [
NABRE	Mark	7	16	] [ e ]
NABRE	Mark	7	17	[ f ] ( E ) When he got home away from the crowd his disciples questioned him about the parable .
NABRE	Mark	7	18	He said to them , “ Are even you likewise without understanding ? Do you not realize that everything that goes into a person from outside can not defile ,
NABRE	Mark	7	19	[ g ] ( F ) since it enters not the heart but the stomach and passes out into the latrine ? ” ( Thus he declared all foods clean . )
NABRE	Mark	7	20	“ But what comes out of a person , that is what defiles .
NABRE	Mark	7	21	( G ) From within people , from their hearts , come evil thoughts , unchastity , theft , murder ,
NABRE	Mark	7	22	adultery , greed , malice , deceit , licentiousness , envy , blasphemy , arrogance , folly .
NABRE	Mark	7	23	. - 7:17 Away from the crowd…the parable : in this context of privacy the term parable refers to something hidden , about to be revealed to the disciples ; cf . Mk 4:10–11 ,
NABRE	Mark	7	24	( H ) From that place he went off to the district of Tyre . [ h ] He entered a house and wanted no one to know about it , but he could not escape notice .
NABRE	Mark	7	25	Soon a woman whose daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him . She came and fell at his feet .
NABRE	Mark	7	26	The woman was a Greek , a Syrophoenician by birth , and she begged him to drive the demon out of her daughter . ( I )
NABRE	Mark	7	27	He said to her , “ Let the children be fed first . [ i ] For it is not right to take the food of the children and throw it to the dogs. ”
NABRE	Mark	7	28	She replied and said to him , “ Lord , even the dogs under the table eat the children ’ s scraps. ”
NABRE	Mark	7	29	Then he said to her , “ For saying this , you may go . The demon has gone out of your daughter. ”
NABRE	Mark	7	30	When the woman went home , she found the child lying in bed and the demon gone . The Healing of a Deaf Man .
NABRE	Mark	7	31	( J ) Again he left the district of Tyre and went by way of Sidon to the Sea of Galilee , into the district of the Decapolis .
NABRE	Mark	7	32	And people brought to him a deaf man who had a speech impediment and begged him to lay his hand on him .
NABRE	Mark	7	33	He took him off by himself away from the crowd . He put his finger into the man ’ s ears and , spitting , touched his tongue ;
NABRE	Mark	7	34	. Jesus sets the Mosaic food laws in the context of the kingdom of God where they are abrogated , and he declares moral defilement the only cause of uncleanness . - 7:19 ( Thus he declared all foods clean ) : if this bold declaration goes back to Jesus , its force was not realized among Jewish Christians in the early church ; cf . Acts 10:1–11:18 . - 7:24–37 The withdrawal of Jesus to the district of Tyre may have been for a respite ( Mk 7:24 ) , but he soon moved onward to Sidon and , by way of the Sea of Galilee , to the Decapolis . These districts provided a Gentile setting for the extension of his ministry of healing because the people there acknowledged his power ( Mk 7:29 ,
NABRE	Mark	7	35	And [ immediately ] the man ’ s ears were opened , his speech impediment was removed , and he spoke plainly .
NABRE	Mark	7	36	[ j ] He ordered them not to tell anyone . But the more he ordered them not to , the more they proclaimed it .
NABRE	Mark	7	37	) . The actions attributed to Jesus ( Mk 7:33–35 ) were also used by healers of the time . - 7:27–28 The figure of a household in which children at table are fed first and then their leftover food is given to the dogs under the table is used effectively to acknowledge the prior claim of the Jews to the ministry of Jesus ; however , Jesus accedes to the Gentile woman ’ s plea for the cure of her afflicted daughter because of her faith . - 7:36 The more they proclaimed it : the same verb proclaim attributed here to the crowd in relation to the miracles of Jesus is elsewhere used in Mark for the preaching of the gospel on the part of Jesus , of his disciples , and of the Christian community ( Mk 1:14 ; 13:10 ; 14:9 ) . Implied in the action of the crowd is a recognition of the salvific mission of Jesus ; see note on Mt 11:5–6 .

NABRE	Mark	8	8	They ate and were satisfied . They picked up the fragments left over—seven baskets .
NABRE	Mark	8	1	Enoch and
NABRE	Mark	8	2	“ My heart is moved with pity for the crowd , because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat .
NABRE	Mark	8	3	If I send them away hungry to their homes , they will collapse on the way , and some of them have come a great distance. ”
NABRE	Mark	8	4	Ezra the “ Son of Man ” is not , as in Daniel , a group , but a unique figure of extraordinary spiritual endowments , who will be revealed as the one through whom the everlasting kingdom decreed by God will be established . It is possible though doubtful that this individualization of the Son of Man figure had been made in Jesus ’ time , and therefore his use of the title in that sense is questionable . Of itself , this expression means simply a human being , or , indefinitely , someone , and there are evidences of this use in pre-Christian times . Its use in the New Testament is probably due to Jesus ’ speaking of himself in that way , “ a human being , ” and the later church ’ s taking this in the sense of the Jewish apocrypha and applying it to him with that meaning . Rejected by the elders , the chief priests , and the scribes : the supreme council called the Sanhedrin was made up of seventy-one members of these three groups and presided over by the high priest . It exercised authority over the Jews in religious matters . See note on Mt 8:20 . - 8:34–35 This utterance of Jesus challenges all believers to authentic discipleship and total commitment to himself through self-renunciation and acceptance of the cross of suffering , even to the sacrifice of life itself . Whoever wishes to save his life will lose it…will save it : an expression of the ambivalence of life and its contrasting destiny . Life seen as mere self-centered earthly existence and lived in denial of Christ ends in destruction , but when lived in loyalty to Christ , despite earthly death , it arrives at fullness of life . - 8:35 For my sake and that of the gospel : Mark here , as at Mk 10:29 equates Jesus with the gospel .

NABRE	Mark	8	5	Still he asked them , “ How many loaves do you have ? ” “ Seven , ” they replied .
NABRE	Mark	8	6	[ b ] He ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground . Then , taking the seven loaves he gave thanks , broke them , and gave them to his disciples to distribute , and they distributed them to the crowd .
NABRE	Mark	8	7	They also had a few fish . He said the blessing over them and ordered them distributed also .
NABRE	Mark	8	9	There were about four thousand people . He dismissed them
NABRE	Mark	8	10	and got into the boat with his disciples and came to the region of Dalmanutha . The Demand for a Sign .
NABRE	Mark	8	11	[ c ] The Pharisees came forward and began to argue with him , ( B ) seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him . ( C )
NABRE	Mark	8	12	He sighed from the depth of his spirit and said , “ Why does this generation seek a sign ? Amen , I say to you , no sign will be given to this generation. ”
NABRE	Mark	8	13	Then he left them , got into the boat again , and went off to the other shore . The Leaven of the Pharisees .
NABRE	Mark	8	14	( D ) They had forgotten to bring bread , and they had only one loaf with them in the boat .
NABRE	Mark	8	15	[ d ] He enjoined them , “ Watch out , guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod. ”
NABRE	Mark	8	16	They concluded among themselves that it was because they had no bread .
NABRE	Mark	8	17	When he became aware of this he said to them , “ Why do you conclude that it is because you have no bread ? Do you not yet understand or comprehend ? Are your hearts hardened ? ( E )
NABRE	Mark	8	18	Do you have eyes and not see , ears and not hear ? And do you not remember , ( F )
NABRE	Mark	8	19	when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand , how many wicker baskets full of fragments you picked up ? ” They answered him , “ Twelve. ”
NABRE	Mark	8	20	“ When I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand , how many full baskets of fragments did you pick up ? ” They answered [ him ] , “ Seven. ”
NABRE	Mark	8	21	. - 8:22–26 Jesus ’ actions and the gradual cure of the blind man probably have the same purpose as in the case of the deaf man ( Mk 7:31–37 ) . Some commentators regard the cure as an intended symbol of the gradual enlightenment of the disciples concerning Jesus ’ messiahship . - 8:27–30 This episode is the turning point in Mark ’ s account of Jesus in his public ministry . Popular opinions concur in regarding him as a prophet . The disciples by contrast believe him to be the Messiah . Jesus acknowledges this identification but prohibits them from making his messianic office known to avoid confusing it with ambiguous contemporary ideas on the nature of that office . See further the notes on Mt 16:13–20 . - 8:31 Son of Man : an enigmatic title . It is used in Dn 7:13–14 as a symbol of “ the saints of the Most High , ” the faithful Israelites who receive the everlasting kingdom from the Ancient One ( God ) . They are represented by a human figure that contrasts with the various beasts who represent the previous kingdoms of the earth . In the Jewish apocryphal books of

NABRE	Mark	8	23	He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village . Putting spittle on his eyes he laid his hands on him and asked , “ Do you see anything ? ” ( G )
NABRE	Mark	8	24	Looking up he replied , “ I see people looking like trees and walking. ”
NABRE	Mark	8	25	Then he laid hands on his eyes a second time and he saw clearly ; his sight was restored and he could see everything distinctly .
NABRE	Mark	8	26	Then he sent him home and said , “ Do not even go into the village. ” III . The Mystery Begins to Be Revealed Peter ’ s Confession About Jesus . [ f ]
NABRE	Mark	8	27	Now Jesus and his disciples set out for the villages of Caesarea Philippi . ( H ) Along the way he asked his disciples , “ Who do people say that I am ? ”
NABRE	Mark	8	28	They said in reply , “ John the Baptist , others Elijah , still others one of the prophets. ”
NABRE	Mark	8	29	And he asked them , “ But who do you say that I am ? ” Peter said to him in reply , “ You are the Messiah. ”
NABRE	Mark	8	30	Then he warned them not to tell anyone about him . The First Prediction of the Passion .
NABRE	Mark	8	31	( I ) He began to teach them that the Son of Man [ g ] must suffer greatly and be rejected by the elders , the chief priests , and the scribes , and be killed , and rise after three days .
NABRE	Mark	8	32	He spoke this openly . Then Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him .
NABRE	Mark	8	33	At this he turned around and , looking at his disciples , rebuked Peter and said , “ Get behind me , Satan . You are thinking not as God does , but as human beings do. ” The Conditions of Discipleship .
NABRE	Mark	8	34	He summoned the crowd with his disciples and said [ h ] to them , “ Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself , take up his cross , and follow me . ( J )
NABRE	Mark	8	35	For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it , but whoever loses his life for my sake and that of the gospel [ i ] will save it . ( K )
NABRE	Mark	8	36	What profit is there for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life ?
NABRE	Mark	8	37	What could one give in exchange for his life ?
NABRE	Mark	8	38	Whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this faithless and sinful generation , the Son of Man will be ashamed of when he comes in his Father ’ s glory with the holy angels. ” ( L ) Footnotes - 8:1–10 The two accounts of the multiplication of loaves and fishes ( Mk 8:1–10 ; 6:31–44 ) have eucharistic significance . Their similarity of structure and themes but dissimilarity of detail are considered by many to refer to a single event that , however , developed in two distinct traditions , one Jewish Christian and the other Gentile Christian , since Jesus in Mark ’ s presentation ( Mk 7:24–37 ) has extended his saving mission to the Gentiles . - 8:6 See note on Mk 6:41 . - 8:11–12 The objection of the Pharisees that Jesus ’ miracles are unsatisfactory for proving the arrival of God ’ s kingdom is comparable to the request of the crowd for a sign in Jn 6:30–31 . Jesus ’ response shows that a sign originating in human demand will not be provided ; cf . Nm 14:11 ,

NABRE	Mark	9	9	As they were coming down from the mountain , he charged them not to relate what they had seen to anyone , except when the Son of Man had risen from the dead . ( C )
NABRE	Mark	9	1	Kgs 8:10 ) . - 9:9–13 At the transfiguration of Jesus his disciples had seen Elijah . They were perplexed because , according to the rabbinical interpretation of Mal 3:23–24 , Elijah was to come first . Jesus ’ response shows that Elijah has come , in the person of John the Baptist , to prepare for the day of the Lord . Jesus must suffer greatly and be treated with contempt ( Mk 9:12 ) like the Baptist ( Mk 9:13 ) ; cf . Mk 6:17–29 . - 9:14–29 The disciples ’ failure to effect a cure seems to reflect unfavorably on Jesus ( Mk 9:14–18 ,
NABRE	Mark	9	2	Pt 1:16–19 . The heavenly voice ( Mk 9:7 ) prepares the disciples to understand that in the divine plan Jesus must die ignominiously before his messianic glory is made manifest ; cf . Lk 24:25–27 . See further the note on Mt 17:1–8 . - 9:5 Moses and Elijah represent , respectively , law and prophecy in the Old Testament and are linked to Mount Sinai ; cf . Ex 19:16–20:17 ;
NABRE	Mark	9	3	and his clothes became dazzling white , such as no fuller on earth could bleach them .
NABRE	Mark	9	4	Then Elijah appeared to them along with Moses , and they were conversing with Jesus .
NABRE	Mark	9	5	[ c ] Then Peter said to Jesus in reply , “ Rabbi , it is good that we are here ! Let us make three tents : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ”
NABRE	Mark	9	6	He hardly knew what to say , they were so terrified .
NABRE	Mark	9	7	Then a cloud came , casting a shadow over them ; [ d ] then from the cloud came a voice , “ This is my beloved Son . Listen to him. ”
NABRE	Mark	9	8	Suddenly , looking around , they no longer saw anyone but Jesus alone with them . The Coming of Elijah . [ e ]
NABRE	Mark	9	10	So they kept the matter to themselves , questioning what rising from the dead meant .
NABRE	Mark	9	11	( D ) Then they asked him , “ Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first ? ”
NABRE	Mark	9	12	He told them , “ Elijah will indeed come first and restore all things , yet how is it written regarding the Son of Man that he must suffer greatly and be treated with contempt ?
NABRE	Mark	9	13	But I tell you that Elijah has come and they did to him whatever they pleased , as it is written of him. ” ( E ) The Healing of a Boy with a Demon . [ f ]
NABRE	Mark	9	14	When they came to the disciples , ( F ) they saw a large crowd around them and scribes arguing with them .
NABRE	Mark	9	15	Immediately on seeing him , the whole crowd was utterly amazed . They ran up to him and greeted him .
NABRE	Mark	9	16	He asked them , “ What are you arguing about with them ? ”
NABRE	Mark	9	17	Someone from the crowd answered him , “ Teacher , I have brought to you my son possessed by a mute spirit .
NABRE	Mark	9	18	Wherever it seizes him , it throws him down ; he foams at the mouth , grinds his teeth , and becomes rigid . I asked your disciples to drive it out , but they were unable to do so. ”
NABRE	Mark	9	19	He said to them in reply , “ O faithless generation , how long will I be with you ? How long will I endure you ? Bring him to me. ”
NABRE	Mark	9	20	They brought the boy to him . And when he saw him , the spirit immediately threw the boy into convulsions . As he fell to the ground , he began to roll around and foam at the mouth .
NABRE	Mark	9	21	Then he questioned his father , “ How long has this been happening to him ? ” He replied , “ Since childhood .
NABRE	Mark	9	22	) . In response Jesus exposes their lack of trust in God ( Mk 9:19 ) and scores their lack of prayer ( Mk 9:29 ) , i.e. , of conscious reliance on God ’ s power when acting in Jesus ’ name . For Matthew , see note on Mt 17:14–20 . Lk 9:37–43 centers attention on Jesus ’ sovereign power . - 9:29 This kind can only come out through prayer : a variant reading adds “ and through fasting. ” - 9:33–37 Mark probably intends this incident and the sayings that follow as commentary on the disciples ’ lack of understanding ( Mk 9:32 ) . Their role in Jesus ’ work is one of service , especially to the poor and lowly . Children were the symbol Jesus used for the anawim , the poor in spirit , the lowly in the Christian community . - 9:38–41 Jesus warns against jealousy and intolerance toward others , such as exorcists who do not follow us . The saying in Mk 9:40 is a broad principle of the divine tolerance . Even the smallest courtesies shown to those who teach in Jesus ’ name do not go unrewarded . - 9:43 ,
NABRE	Mark	9	23	Jesus said to him , “ ‘ If you can ! ’ Everything is possible to one who has faith. ”
NABRE	Mark	9	24	Then the boy ’ s father cried out , “ I do believe , help my unbelief ! ”
NABRE	Mark	9	25	Jesus , on seeing a crowd rapidly gathering , rebuked the unclean spirit and said to it , “ Mute and deaf spirit , I command you : come out of him and never enter him again ! ”
NABRE	Mark	9	26	Shouting and throwing the boy into convulsions , it came out . He became like a corpse , which caused many to say , “ He is dead ! ”
NABRE	Mark	9	27	But Jesus took him by the hand , raised him , and he stood up .
NABRE	Mark	9	28	When he entered the house , his disciples asked him in private , “ Why could we not drive it out ? ”
NABRE	Mark	9	29	[ g ] He said to them , “ This kind can only come out through prayer. ” The Second Prediction of the Passion .
NABRE	Mark	9	30	( G ) They left from there and began a journey through Galilee , but he did not wish anyone to know about it . ( H )
NABRE	Mark	9	31	He was teaching his disciples and telling them , “ The Son of Man is to be handed over to men and they will kill him , and three days after his death he will rise. ”
NABRE	Mark	9	32	But they did not understand the saying , and they were afraid to question him . IV . The Full Revelation of the Mystery The Greatest in the Kingdom . [ h ]
NABRE	Mark	9	33	They came to Capernaum and , once inside the house , he began to ask them , “ What were you arguing about on the way ? ” ( I )
NABRE	Mark	9	34	But they remained silent . They had been discussing among themselves on the way who was the greatest .
NABRE	Mark	9	35	Then he sat down , called the Twelve , and said to them , “ If anyone wishes to be first , he shall be the last of all and the servant of all. ” ( J )
NABRE	Mark	9	36	Taking a child he placed it in their midst , and putting his arms around it he said to them ,
NABRE	Mark	9	37	“ Whoever receives one child such as this in my name , receives me ; and whoever receives me , receives not me but the One who sent me. ” ( K ) Another Exorcist . [ i ]
NABRE	Mark	9	38	John said to him , ( L ) “ Teacher , we saw someone driving out demons in your name , and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow us. ”
NABRE	Mark	9	39	Jesus replied , “ Do not prevent him . There is no one who performs a mighty deed in my name who can at the same time speak ill of me .
NABRE	Mark	9	40	For whoever is not against us is for us . ( M )
NABRE	Mark	9	41	Anyone who gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ , amen , I say to you , will surely not lose his reward . ( N ) Temptations to Sin .
NABRE	Mark	9	42	( O ) “ Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe [ in me ] to sin , it would be better for him if a great millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea .
NABRE	Mark	9	43	If your hand causes you to sin , cut it off . It is better for you to enter into life maimed than with two hands to go into Gehenna , [ j ] into the unquenchable fire . [

Some add “ every sacrifice will be salted with salt. ” The purifying and preservative use of salt in food ( Lv 2:13 ) and the refinement effected through fire refer here to comparable effects in the spiritual life of the disciples of Jesus .

His glory will overcome his death and that of his disciples ; cf .

NABRE	Mark	10	10	In the house the disciples again questioned him about this .
NABRE	Mark	10	1	He set out from there and went into the district of Judea [ and ] across the Jordan . Again crowds gathered around him and , as was his custom , he again taught them .
NABRE	Mark	10	2	[ a ] The Pharisees approached and asked , “ Is it lawful for a husband to divorce his wife ? ” They were testing him . ( A )

NABRE	Mark	10	4	They replied , “ Moses permitted him to write a bill of divorce and dismiss her. ” ( B )
NABRE	Mark	10	5	But Jesus told them , “ Because of the hardness of your hearts he wrote you this commandment .

NABRE	Mark	10	13	( F ) And people were bringing children to him that he might touch them , but the disciples rebuked them . ( G )
NABRE	Mark	10	14	When Jesus saw this he became indignant and said to them , “ Let the children come to me ; do not prevent them , for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .

NABRE	Mark	10	19	You know the commandments : ‘ You shall not kill ; you shall not commit adultery ; you shall not steal ; you shall not bear false witness ; you shall not defraud ; honor your father and your mother. ’ ” ( J )
NABRE	Mark	10	20	He replied and said to him , “ Teacher , all of these I have observed from my youth. ”
NABRE	Mark	10	21	Jesus , looking at him , loved him and said to him , “ You are lacking in one thing . Go , sell what you have , and give to [ the ] poor and you will have treasure in heaven ; then come , follow me. ”
NABRE	Mark	10	22	At that statement his face fell , and he went away sad , for he had many possessions .
NABRE	Mark	10	23	[ d ] Jesus looked around and said to his disciples , “ How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God ! ” ( K )
NABRE	Mark	10	24	The disciples were amazed at his words . So Jesus again said to them in reply , “ Children , how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God !
NABRE	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to pass through [ the ] eye of [ a ] needle than for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of God. ”
NABRE	Mark	10	26	) . Since wealth , power , and merit generate false security , Jesus rejects them utterly as a claim to enter the kingdom . Achievement of salvation is beyond human capability and depends solely on the goodness of God who offers it as a gift ( Mk 10:27 ) . - 10:38–40 Can you drink the cup…I am baptized ? : the metaphor of drinking the cup is used in the Old Testament to refer to acceptance of the destiny assigned by God ; see note on Psalm 11:6 . In Jesus ’ case , this involves divine judgment on sin that Jesus the innocent one is to expiate on behalf of the guilty ( Mk 14:24 ; Is 53:5 ) . His baptism is to be his crucifixion and death for the salvation of the human race ; cf . Lk 12:50 . The request of James and John for a share in the glory ( Mk 10:35–37 ) must of necessity involve a share in Jesus ’ sufferings , the endurance of tribulation and suffering for the gospel ( Mk 10:39 ) . The authority of assigning places of honor in the kingdom is reserved to God ( Mk 10:40 ) . - 10:42–45 Whatever authority is to be exercised by the disciples must , like that of Jesus , be rendered as service to others ( Mk 10:45 ) rather than for personal aggrandizement ( Mk 10:42–44 ) . The service of Jesus is his passion and death for the sins of the human race ( Mk 10:45 ) ; cf . Mk 14:24 ; Is 53:11–12 ; Mt 26:28 ; Lk 22:19–20 . - 10:46–52 See notes on Mt 9:27–31 and 20:29–34 .

NABRE	Mark	10	27	Jesus looked at them and said , “ For human beings it is impossible , but not for God . All things are possible for God. ”
NABRE	Mark	10	28	Peter began to say to him , “ We have given up everything and followed you. ”
NABRE	Mark	10	29	Jesus said , “ Amen , I say to you , there is no one who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands for my sake and for the sake of the gospel
NABRE	Mark	10	30	who will not receive a hundred times more now in this present age : houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands , with persecutions , and eternal life in the age to come .
NABRE	Mark	10	31	But many that are first will be last , and [ the ] last will be first. ” ( L ) The Third Prediction of the Passion .
NABRE	Mark	10	32	( M ) They were on the way , going up to Jerusalem , and Jesus went ahead of them . They were amazed , and those who followed were afraid . Taking the Twelve aside again , he began to tell them what was going to happen to him .
NABRE	Mark	10	33	“ Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes , and they will condemn him to death and hand him over to the Gentiles
NABRE	Mark	10	34	who will mock him , spit upon him , scourge him , and put him to death , but after three days he will rise. ” Ambition of James and John .
NABRE	Mark	10	35	( N ) Then James and John , the sons of Zebedee , came to him and said to him , “ Teacher , we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you. ”
NABRE	Mark	10	36	He replied , “ What do you wish [ me ] to do for you ? ”
NABRE	Mark	10	37	They answered him , “ Grant that in your glory we may sit one at your right and the other at your left. ”
NABRE	Mark	10	38	[ e ] ( O ) Jesus said to them , “ You do not know what you are asking . Can you drink the cup that I drink or be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized ? ”
NABRE	Mark	10	39	They said to him , “ We can. ” Jesus said to them , “ The cup that I drink , you will drink , and with the baptism with which I am baptized , you will be baptized ;
NABRE	Mark	10	40	but to sit at my right or at my left is not mine to give but is for those for whom it has been prepared. ”
NABRE	Mark	10	41	When the ten heard this , they became indignant at James and John .
NABRE	Mark	10	42	[ f ] Jesus summoned them and said to them , ( P ) “ You know that those who are recognized as rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them , and their great ones make their authority over them felt .
NABRE	Mark	10	43	But it shall not be so among you . Rather , whoever wishes to be great among you will be your servant ;
NABRE	Mark	10	44	whoever wishes to be first among you will be the slave of all .
NABRE	Mark	10	45	For the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many. ” The Blind Bartimaeus . [ g ]
NABRE	Mark	10	46	They came to Jericho . ( Q ) And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a sizable crowd , Bartimaeus , a blind man , the son of Timaeus , sat by the roadside begging .
NABRE	Mark	10	47	On hearing that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out and say , “ Jesus , son of David , have pity on me. ”
NABRE	Mark	10	48	And many rebuked him , telling him to be silent . But he kept calling out all the more , “ Son of David , have pity on me. ”
NABRE	Mark	10	49	Jesus stopped and said , “ Call him. ” So they called the blind man , saying to him , “ Take courage ; get up , he is calling you. ”
NABRE	Mark	10	50	He threw aside his cloak , sprang up , and came to Jesus .
NABRE	Mark	10	51	Jesus said to him in reply , “ What do you want me to do for you ? ” The blind man replied to him , “ Master , I want to see. ”
NABRE	Mark	10	52	Jesus told him , “ Go your way ; your faith has saved you. ” Immediately he received his sight and followed him on the way . Footnotes - 10:2–9 In the dialogue between Jesus and the Pharisees on the subject of divorce , Jesus declares that the law of Moses permitted divorce ( Dt 24:1 ) only because of the hardness of your hearts ( Mk 10:4–5 ) . In citing Gn 1:27 and 2:24 Jesus proclaims permanence to be the divine intent from the beginning concerning human marriage ( Mk 10:6–8 ) . He reaffirms this with the declaration that what God has joined together , no human being must separate ( Mk 10:9 ) . See further the notes on Mt 5:31–32 ; 19:3–9 . - 10:15 Whoever does not accept the kingdom of God like a child : i.e. , in total dependence upon and obedience to the gospel ; cf . Mt 18:3–4 . - 10:18 Why do you call me good ? : Jesus repudiates the term “ good ” for himself and directs it to God , the source of all goodness who alone can grant the gift of eternal life ; cf . Mt 19:16–17 . - 10:23–27 In the Old Testament wealth and material goods are considered a sign of God ’ s favor ( Jb 1:10 ; Ps 128:1–2 ; Is 3:10 ) . The words of Jesus in Mk 10:23–25 provoke astonishment among the disciples because of their apparent contradiction of the Old Testament concept ( Mk 10:24 ,

NABRE	Mark	11	11	He entered Jerusalem and went into the temple area . He looked around at everything and , since it was already late , went out to Bethany with the Twelve . ( C ) Jesus Curses a Fig Tree . [ b ]
NABRE	Mark	11	1	When they drew near to Jerusalem , ( A ) to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples
NABRE	Mark	11	2	and said to them , “ Go into the village opposite you , and immediately on entering it , you will find a colt tethered on which no one has ever sat . Untie it and bring it here .
NABRE	Mark	11	3	If anyone should say to you , ‘ Why are you doing this ? ’ reply , ‘ The Master has need of it and will send it back here at once. ’ ”
NABRE	Mark	11	4	So they went off and found a colt tethered at a gate outside on the street , and they untied it .
NABRE	Mark	11	5	Some of the bystanders said to them , “ What are you doing , untying the colt ? ”
NABRE	Mark	11	6	They answered them just as Jesus had told them to , and they permitted them to do it .
NABRE	Mark	11	7	So they brought the colt to Jesus and put their cloaks over it . And he sat on it .
NABRE	Mark	11	8	Many people spread their cloaks on the road , and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields .
NABRE	Mark	11	9	Those preceding him as well as those following kept crying out : ( B ) “ Hosanna ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord !
NABRE	Mark	11	10	Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is to come ! Hosanna in the highest ! ”
NABRE	Mark	11	12	The next day as they were leaving Bethany he was hungry . ( D )
NABRE	Mark	11	13	Seeing from a distance a fig tree in leaf , he went over to see if he could find anything on it . When he reached it he found nothing but leaves ; it was not the time for figs .
NABRE	Mark	11	14	And he said to it in reply , “ May no one ever eat of your fruit again ! ” And his disciples heard it . Cleansing of the Temple . [ c ]
NABRE	Mark	11	15	They came to Jerusalem , ( E ) and on entering the temple area he began to drive out those selling and buying there . He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves .
NABRE	Mark	11	16	. Cursing the fig tree is a parable in action representing Jesus ’ judgment ( Mk 11:20 ) on barren Israel and the fate of Jerusalem for failing to receive his teaching ; cf . Is 34:4 ; Hos 2:14 ; Lk 13:6–9 . - 11:15–19 See note on Mt 21:12–17 . - 11:26 This verse , which reads , “ But if you do not forgive , neither will your heavenly Father forgive your transgressions , ” is omitted in the best manuscripts . It was probably added by copyists under the influence of Mt 6:15 . - 11:27–33 The mounting hostility toward Jesus came from the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders ( Mk 11:27 ) ; the Herodians and the Pharisees ( Mk 12:13 ) ; and the Sadducees ( Mk 12:18 ) . By their rejection of God ’ s messengers , John the Baptist and Jesus , they incurred the divine judgment implied in Mk 11:27–33 and confirmed in the parable of the vineyard tenants ( Mk 12:1–12 ) .

NABRE	Mark	11	17	Then he taught them saying , “ Is it not written : ‘ My house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples ’ ? But you have made it a den of thieves. ” ( F )
NABRE	Mark	11	18	The chief priests and the scribes came to hear of it and were seeking a way to put him to death , yet they feared him because the whole crowd was astonished at his teaching .
NABRE	Mark	11	19	When evening came , they went out of the city . ( G ) The Withered Fig Tree .
NABRE	Mark	11	20	( H ) Early in the morning , as they were walking along , they saw the fig tree withered to its roots .
NABRE	Mark	11	21	Peter remembered and said to him , “ Rabbi , look ! The fig tree that you cursed has withered. ”
NABRE	Mark	11	22	Jesus said to them in reply , “ Have faith in God .
NABRE	Mark	11	23	Amen , I say to you , whoever says to this mountain , ‘ Be lifted up and thrown into the sea , ’ and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen , it shall be done for him . ( I )
NABRE	Mark	11	24	Therefore I tell you , all that you ask for in prayer , believe that you will receive it and it shall be yours . ( J )
NABRE	Mark	11	25	When you stand to pray , forgive anyone against whom you have a grievance , so that your heavenly Father may in turn forgive you your transgressions. ” ( K ) [
NABRE	Mark	11	26	] [ d ] The Authority of Jesus Questioned . [ e ]
NABRE	Mark	11	27	They returned once more to Jerusalem . ( L ) As he was walking in the temple area , the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders approached him
NABRE	Mark	11	28	and said to him , “ By what authority are you doing these things ? Or who gave you this authority to do them ? ”
NABRE	Mark	11	29	Jesus said to them , “ I shall ask you one question . Answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
NABRE	Mark	11	30	Was John ’ s baptism of heavenly or of human origin ? Answer me. ”
NABRE	Mark	11	31	They discussed this among themselves and said , “ If we say , ‘ Of heavenly origin , ’ he will say , ‘ [ Then ] why did you not believe him ? ’
NABRE	Mark	11	32	But shall we say , ‘ Of human origin ’ ? ” —they feared the crowd , for they all thought John really was a prophet .
NABRE	Mark	11	33	So they said to Jesus in reply , “ We do not know. ” Then Jesus said to them , “ Neither shall I tell you by what authority I do these things. ” Footnotes - 11:1–11 In Mark ’ s account Jesus takes the initiative in ordering the preparation for his entry into Jerusalem ( Mk 11:1–6 ) even as he later orders the preparation of his last Passover supper ( Mk 14:12–16 ) . In Mk 10:9–10 the greeting Jesus receives stops short of proclaiming him Messiah . He is greeted rather as the prophet of the coming messianic kingdom . Contrast Mt 21:9 . - 11:12–14 Jesus ’ search for fruit on the fig tree recalls the prophets ’ earlier use of this image to designate Israel ; cf . Jer 8:13 ; 29:17 ; Jl 1:7 ; Hos 9:10 ,

NABRE	Mark	12	12	They were seeking to arrest him , but they feared the crowd , for they realized that he had addressed the parable to them . So they left him and went away . Paying Taxes to the Emperor .
NABRE	Mark	12	1	He began to speak to them in parables . ( A ) “ A man planted a vineyard , put a hedge around it , dug a wine press , and built a tower . Then he leased it to tenant farmers and left on a journey . ( B )

NABRE	Mark	12	3	But they seized him , beat him , and sent him away empty-handed .
NABRE	Mark	12	4	Again he sent them another servant . And that one they beat over the head and treated shamefully .
NABRE	Mark	12	5	He sent yet another whom they killed . So , too , many others ; some they beat , others they killed .
NABRE	Mark	12	6	He had one other to send , a beloved son . He sent him to them last of all , thinking , ‘ They will respect my son. ’
NABRE	Mark	12	7	But those tenants said to one another , ‘ This is the heir . Come , let us kill him , and the inheritance will be ours. ’
NABRE	Mark	12	8	So they seized him and killed him , and threw him out of the vineyard .
NABRE	Mark	12	9	What [ then ] will the owner of the vineyard do ? He will come , put the tenants to death , and give the vineyard to others .
NABRE	Mark	12	10	Have you not read this scripture passage : ( C ) ‘ The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ;
NABRE	Mark	12	11	by the Lord has this been done , and it is wonderful in our eyes ’ ? ”
NABRE	Mark	12	13	[ b ] They sent some Pharisees ( D ) and Herodians to him to ensnare him ( E ) in his speech . [ c ]
NABRE	Mark	12	14	They came and said to him , “ Teacher , we know that you are a truthful man and that you are not concerned with anyone ’ s opinion . You do not regard a person ’ s status but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth . Is it lawful to pay the census tax to Caesar or not ? Should we pay or should we not pay ? ”
NABRE	Mark	12	15	Knowing their hypocrisy he said to them , “ Why are you testing me ? Bring me a denarius to look at. ”
NABRE	Mark	12	16	They brought one to him and he said to them , “ Whose image and inscription is this ? ” They replied to him , “ Caesar ’ s. ”
NABRE	Mark	12	17	So Jesus said to them , “ Repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God. ” They were utterly amazed at him . ( F ) The Question About the Resurrection . [ d ]
NABRE	Mark	12	18	Some Sadducees , who say there is no resurrection , came to him and put this question to him ,
NABRE	Mark	12	19	saying , “ Teacher , Moses wrote for us , ‘ If someone ’ s brother dies , leaving a wife but no child , his brother must take the wife and raise up descendants for his brother. ’ ( G )
NABRE	Mark	12	20	Now there were seven brothers . The first married a woman and died , leaving no descendants .
NABRE	Mark	12	21	So the second married her and died , leaving no descendants , and the third likewise .
NABRE	Mark	12	22	And the seven left no descendants . Last of all the woman also died .
NABRE	Mark	12	23	At the resurrection [ when they arise ] whose wife will she be ? For all seven had been married to her. ”
NABRE	Mark	12	24	Jesus said to them , “ Are you not misled because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God ?
NABRE	Mark	12	25	When they rise from the dead , they neither marry nor are given in marriage , but they are like the angels in heaven .
NABRE	Mark	12	26	As for the dead being raised , have you not read in the Book of Moses , in the passage about the bush , how God told him , ‘ I am the God of Abraham , [ the ] God of Isaac , and [ the ] God of Jacob ’ ? ( H )
NABRE	Mark	12	27	He is not God of the dead but of the living . You are greatly misled. ” The Greatest Commandment . [ e ]
NABRE	Mark	12	28	One of the scribes , ( I ) when he came forward and heard them disputing and saw how well he had answered them , asked him , “ Which is the first of all the commandments ? ”
NABRE	Mark	12	29	Jesus replied , “ The first is this : ‘ Hear , O Israel ! The Lord our God is Lord alone !
NABRE	Mark	12	30	You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul , with all your mind , and with all your strength. ’ ( J )
NABRE	Mark	12	31	The second is this : ‘ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ’ There is no other commandment greater than these. ” ( K )
NABRE	Mark	12	32	The scribe said to him , “ Well said , teacher . You are right in saying , ‘ He is One and there is no other than he. ’
NABRE	Mark	12	33	And ‘ to love him with all your heart , with all your understanding , with all your strength , and to love your neighbor as yourself ’ is worth more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices. ” ( L )
NABRE	Mark	12	34	; Rom 1:3 ;
NABRE	Mark	12	35	As Jesus was teaching in the temple area he said , ( N ) “ How do the scribes claim that the Messiah is the son of David ?
NABRE	Mark	12	36	David himself , inspired by the holy Spirit , said : ‘ The Lord said to my lord , “ Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies under your feet. ” ’ ( O )
NABRE	Mark	12	37	David himself calls him ‘ lord ’ ; so how is he his son ? ” [ The ] great crowd heard this with delight . Denunciation of the Scribes . [ g ]
NABRE	Mark	12	38	In the course of his teaching he said , ( P ) “ Beware of the scribes , who like to go around in long robes and accept greetings in the marketplaces ,
NABRE	Mark	12	39	seats of honor in synagogues , and places of honor at banquets .
NABRE	Mark	12	40	They devour the houses of widows and , as a pretext , recite lengthy prayers . They will receive a very severe condemnation. ” The Poor Widow ’ s Contribution . [ h ]
NABRE	Mark	12	41	He sat down opposite the treasury and observed how the crowd put money into the treasury . ( Q ) Many rich people put in large sums .
NABRE	Mark	12	42	A poor widow also came and put in two small coins worth a few cents .
NABRE	Mark	12	43	Calling his disciples to himself , he said to them , “ Amen , I say to you , this poor widow put in more than all the other contributors to the treasury .
NABRE	Mark	12	44	For they have all contributed from their surplus wealth , but she , from her poverty , has contributed all she had , her whole livelihood. ” Footnotes - 12:1–12 The vineyard denotes Israel ( Is 5:1–7 ) . The tenant farmers are the religious leaders of Israel . God is the owner of the vineyard . His servants are his messengers , the prophets . The beloved son is Jesus ( Mk 1:11 ; 9:7 ; Mt 3:17 ; 17:5 ; Lk 3:22 ; 9:35 ) . The punishment of the tenants refers to the religious leaders , and the transfer of the vineyard to others refers to the people of the new Israel . - 12:13–34 In the ensuing conflicts ( cf . also Mk 2:1–3:6 ) Jesus vanquishes his adversaries by his responses to their questions and reduces them to silence ( Mk 12:34 ) . - 12:13–17 See note on Mt 22:15–22 . - 12:18–27 See note on Mt 22:23–33 . - 12:28–34 See note on Mt 22:34–40 . - 12:35–37 Jesus questions the claim of the scribes about the Davidic descent of the Messiah , not to deny it ( Mt 1:1 ; Acts 2:20 ,

NABRE	Mark	13	1	As he was making his way out of the temple area one of his disciples said to him , “ Look , teacher , what stones and what buildings ! ” ( A )

NABRE	Mark	13	3	[ b ] As he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple area , Peter , James , John , and Andrew asked him privately , ( B )
NABRE	Mark	13	4	“ Tell us , when will this happen , and what sign will there be when all these things are about to come to an end ? ”
NABRE	Mark	13	5	Jesus began to say to them , “ See that no one deceives you . ( C )

NABRE	Mark	13	34	It is like a man traveling abroad . He leaves home and places his servants in charge , each with his work , and orders the gatekeeper to be on the watch . ( O )
NABRE	Mark	13	35	Watch , therefore ; you do not know when the lord of the house is coming , whether in the evening , or at midnight , or at cockcrow , or in the morning .
NABRE	Mark	13	36	May he not come suddenly and find you sleeping .
NABRE	Mark	13	37	What I say to you , I say to all : ‘ Watch ! ’ ” Footnotes - 13:1–2 The reconstructed temple with its precincts , begun under Herod the Great ca .
NABRE	Mark	13	70	at the hands of the Romans ; cf . Jer 26:18 ; Mt 24:1–2 . For the dating of the reconstruction of the temple , see further the note on Jn 2:20 . - 13:3–37 Jesus ’ prediction of the destruction of the temple ( Mk 13:2 ) provoked questions that the four named disciples put to him in private regarding the time and the sign when all these things are about to come to an end ( Mk 13:3–4 ) . The response to their questions was Jesus ’ eschatological discourse prior to his imminent death . It contained instruction and consolation exhorting the disciples and the church to faith and obedience through the trials that would confront them ( Mk 13:5–13 ) . The sign is the presence of the desolating abomination ( Mk 13:14 ; see Dn 9:27 ) , i.e. , of the Roman power profaning the temple . Flight from Jerusalem is urged rather than defense of the city through misguided messianic hope ( Mk 13:14–23 ) . Intervention will occur only after destruction ( Mk 13:24–27 ) , which will happen before the end of the first Christian generation ( Mk 13:28–31 ) . No one but the Father knows the precise time , or that of the parousia ( Mk 13:32 ) ; hence the necessity of constant vigilance ( Mk 13:33–37 ) . Luke sets the parousia at a later date , after “ the time of the Gentiles ” ( Lk 21:24 ) . See also notes on Mt 24:1–25:46 . - 13:10 The gospel…to all nations : the period of the Christian mission . - 13:14 The participle standing is masculine , in contrast to the neuter at Mt 24:15 . - 13:26 Son of Man…with great power and glory : Jesus cites this text from Dn 7:13 in his response to the high priest , Are you the Messiah ? ( Mk 14:61 ) . In Ex 34:5 ; Lv 16:2 ; and Nm 11:25 the clouds indicate the presence of the divinity . Thus in his role of Son of Man , Jesus is a heavenly being who will come in power and glory .

NABRE	Mark	14	14	. - 14:13 A man…carrying a jar of water : perhaps a prearranged signal , for only women ordinarily carried water in jars . The Greek word used here , however , implies simply a person and not necessarily a male . - 14:18 One of you will betray me , one who is eating with me : contrasts the intimacy of table fellowship at the Passover meal with the treachery of the traitor ; cf . Ps 41:10 . - 14:21 The Son of Man indeed goes , as it is written of him : a reference to Ps 41:10 cited by Jesus concerning Judas at the Last Supper ; cf . Jn 13:18–19 . - 14:22–24 The actions and words of Jesus express within the framework of the Passover meal and the transition to a new covenant the sacrifice of himself through the offering of his body and blood in anticipation of his passion and death . His blood of the covenant both alludes to the ancient rite of Ex 24:4–8 and indicates the new community that the sacrifice of Jesus will bring into being ( Mt 26:26–28 ; Lk 22:19–20 ;
NABRE	Mark	14	1	Cor 11:24 . The sense of both words is vicarious , and it is difficult in Hellenistic Greek to distinguish between them . For many in the sense of “ all , ” see note on Mt 20:28 . - 14:26 After singing a hymn : Ps 114–118 , thanksgiving songs concluding the Passover meal . - 14:27–31 Jesus predicted that the Twelve would waver in their faith , even abandon him , despite their protestations to the contrary . Yet he reassured them that after his resurrection he would regather them in Galilee ( Mk 16:7 ; cf . Mt 26:32 ; 28:7 ,

NABRE	Mark	14	3	When he was in Bethany reclining at table in the house of Simon the leper , ( B ) a woman came with an alabaster jar of perfumed oil , costly genuine spikenard . She broke the alabaster jar and poured it on his head .
NABRE	Mark	14	4	There were some who were indignant . “ Why has there been this waste of perfumed oil ?
NABRE	Mark	14	5	It could have been sold for more than three hundred days ’ wages and the money given to the poor. ” They were infuriated with her .
NABRE	Mark	14	6	Jesus said , “ Let her alone . Why do you make trouble for her ? She has done a good thing for me .
NABRE	Mark	14	7	The poor you will always have with you , and whenever you wish you can do good to them , but you will not always have me .
NABRE	Mark	14	8	She has done what she could . She has anticipated anointing my body for burial .
NABRE	Mark	14	9	Amen , I say to you , wherever the gospel is proclaimed to the whole world , what she has done will be told in memory of her. ” The Betrayal by Judas .

NABRE	Mark	14	12	. Everyone is faced with this struggle , the full force of which Jesus accepted on our behalf and , through his bitter passion and death , achieved the victory . - 14:53 They led Jesus away…came together : Mark presents a formal assembly of the whole Sanhedrin ( chief priests , elders , and scribes ) at night , leading to the condemnation of Jesus ( Mk 14:64 ) , in contrast to Lk 22:66 ,
NABRE	Mark	14	13	He sent two of his disciples and said to them , “ Go into the city and a man will meet you , carrying a jar of water . [ e ] Follow him .
NABRE	Mark	14	15	Then he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready . Make the preparations for us there. ”

NABRE	Mark	14	17	( E ) When it was evening , he came with the Twelve .
NABRE	Mark	14	18	[ f ] And as they reclined at table and were eating , Jesus said , “ Amen , I say to you , one of you will betray me , one who is eating with me. ”

The word ’ abbā ’ seems not to have been used in earlier or contemporaneous Jewish sources to address God without some qualifier . Cf . Rom 8:15 ; Gal 4:6 for other occurrences of the Aramaic word in the Greek New Testament . Not what I will but what you will : note the complete obedient surrender of the human will of Jesus to the divine will of the Father ; cf . Jn 4:34 ; 8:29 ; Rom 5:19 ; Phil 2:8 ; Hb 5:8 . - 14:38 The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak : the spirit is drawn to what is good yet found in conflict with the flesh , inclined to sin ; cf . Ps 51:7 ,
NABRE	Mark	14	22	[ h ] While they were eating , ( F ) he took bread , said the blessing , broke it , and gave it to them , and said , “ Take it ; this is my body. ”
NABRE	Mark	14	23	Then he took a cup , gave thanks , and gave it to them , and they all drank from it .
NABRE	Mark	14	24	He said to them , “ This is my blood of the covenant , which will be shed [ i ] for many .
NABRE	Mark	14	25	Amen , I say to you , I shall not drink again the fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God. ”
NABRE	Mark	14	26	Then , after singing a hymn , [ j ] they went out to the Mount of Olives . ( G ) Peter ’ s Denial Foretold . [ k ]
NABRE	Mark	14	27	Then Jesus said to them , “ All of you will have your faith shaken , for it is written : ‘ I will strike the shepherd , and the sheep will be dispersed. ’ ( H )
NABRE	Mark	14	28	But after I have been raised up , I shall go before you to Galilee. ”
NABRE	Mark	14	29	Peter said to him , “ Even though all should have their faith shaken , mine will not be. ”
NABRE	Mark	14	30	Then Jesus said to him , “ Amen , I say to you , this very night before the cock crows twice you will deny me three times. ”
NABRE	Mark	14	31	But he vehemently replied , “ Even though I should have to die with you , I will not deny you. ” And they all spoke similarly . The Agony in the Garden .
NABRE	Mark	14	32	[ l ] Then they came to a place named Gethsemane , ( I ) and he said to his disciples , “ Sit here while I pray. ” ( J )
NABRE	Mark	14	33	He took with him Peter , James , and John , and began to be troubled and distressed .
NABRE	Mark	14	34	Then he said to them , “ My soul is sorrowful even to death . Remain here and keep watch. ”
NABRE	Mark	14	35	He advanced a little and fell to the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass by him ;
NABRE	Mark	14	36	he said , “ Abba , Father , [ m ] all things are possible to you . Take this cup away from me , but not what I will but what you will. ”
NABRE	Mark	14	37	When he returned he found them asleep . He said to Peter , “ Simon , are you asleep ? Could you not keep watch for one hour ?
NABRE	Mark	14	38	[ n ] Watch and pray that you may not undergo the test . ( K ) The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak. ”
NABRE	Mark	14	39	Withdrawing again , he prayed , saying the same thing .
NABRE	Mark	14	40	Then he returned once more and found them asleep , for they could not keep their eyes open and did not know what to answer him .
NABRE	Mark	14	41	He returned a third time and said to them , “ Are you still sleeping and taking your rest ? It is enough . The hour has come . Behold , the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners .
NABRE	Mark	14	42	Get up , let us go . See , my betrayer is at hand. ” The Betrayal and Arrest of Jesus .
NABRE	Mark	14	43	( L ) Then , while he was still speaking , Judas , one of the Twelve , arrived , accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs who had come from the chief priests , the scribes , and the elders .
NABRE	Mark	14	44	His betrayer had arranged a signal with them , saying , “ The man I shall kiss is the one ; arrest him and lead him away securely. ”
NABRE	Mark	14	45	He came and immediately went over to him and said , “ Rabbi. ” And he kissed him .
NABRE	Mark	14	46	At this they laid hands on him and arrested him .
NABRE	Mark	14	47	One of the bystanders drew his sword , struck the high priest ’ s servant , and cut off his ear .
NABRE	Mark	14	48	Jesus said to them in reply , “ Have you come out as against a robber , with swords and clubs , to seize me ?
NABRE	Mark	14	49	Day after day I was with you teaching in the temple area , yet you did not arrest me ; but that the scriptures may be fulfilled. ”
NABRE	Mark	14	50	And they all left him and fled .
NABRE	Mark	14	51	Now a young man followed him wearing nothing but a linen cloth about his body . They seized him ,
NABRE	Mark	14	52	but he left the cloth behind and ran off naked . Jesus Before the Sanhedrin .
NABRE	Mark	14	53	[ o ] ( M ) They led Jesus away to the high priest , and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together .
NABRE	Mark	14	54	Peter followed him at a distance into the high priest ’ s courtyard and was seated with the guards , warming himself at the fire .
NABRE	Mark	14	55	The chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin kept trying to obtain testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death , but they found none .
NABRE	Mark	14	56	Many gave false witness against him , but their testimony did not agree .
NABRE	Mark	14	57	[ p ] Some took the stand and testified falsely against him , alleging ,
NABRE	Mark	14	58	“ We heard him say , ‘ I will destroy this temple made with hands and within three days I will build another not made with hands. ’ ” ( N )
NABRE	Mark	14	59	Even so their testimony did not agree .
NABRE	Mark	14	60	The high priest rose before the assembly and questioned Jesus , saying , “ Have you no answer ? What are these men testifying against you ? ”
NABRE	Mark	14	61	[ q ] But he was silent and answered nothing . Again the high priest asked him and said to him , “ Are you the Messiah , the son of the Blessed One ? ”
NABRE	Mark	14	62	Then Jesus answered , “ I am ; and ‘ you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven. ’ ” ( O )
NABRE	Mark	14	63	At that the high priest tore his garments and said , “ What further need have we of witnesses ?
NABRE	Mark	14	64	You have heard the blasphemy . What do you think ? ” They all condemned him as deserving to die .
NABRE	Mark	14	65	Some began to spit on him . They blindfolded him and struck him and said to him , “ Prophesy ! ” And the guards greeted him with blows . ( P ) Peter ’ s Denial of Jesus .
NABRE	Mark	14	66	( Q ) While Peter was below in the courtyard , one of the high priest ’ s maids came along .
NABRE	Mark	14	67	Seeing Peter warming himself , she looked intently at him and said , “ You too were with the Nazarene , Jesus. ”
NABRE	Mark	14	68	[ r ] But he denied it saying , “ I neither know nor understand what you are talking about. ” So he went out into the outer court . [ Then the cock crowed . ]
NABRE	Mark	14	69	The maid saw him and began again to say to the bystanders , “ This man is one of them. ”
NABRE	Mark	14	70	Once again he denied it . A little later the bystanders said to Peter once more , “ Surely you are one of them ; for you too are a Galilean. ”

I am : indicates Jesus ’ acknowledgment that he is the Messiah and Son of God ; cf . Mk 1:1 . Contrast Mt 26:64 and Lk 22:67–70 , in which Jesus leaves his interrogators to answer their own question . You will see the Son of Man…with the clouds of heaven : an allusion to Dn 7:13 and Ps 110:1 portending the enthronement of Jesus as judge in the transcendent glory of God ’ s kingdom . The Power : another surrogate for the name of God . - 14:68 [ Then the cock crowed ] : found in most manuscripts , perhaps in view of Mk 14:30 ,

It reads : “ And they excused themselves , saying , ‘ This age of lawlessness and unbelief is under Satan , who does not allow the truth and power of God to prevail over the unclean things dominated by the spirits [ or , does not allow the unclean things dominated by the spirits to grasp the truth and power of God ] . Therefore reveal your righteousness now. ’ They spoke to Christ . And Christ responded to them , ‘ The limit of the years of Satan ’ s power is completed , but other terrible things draw near . And for those who sinned I was handed over to death , that they might return to the truth and no longer sin , in order that they might inherit the spiritual and incorruptible heavenly glory of righteousness .

NABRE	Luke	1	5	In the days of Herod , King of Judea , [ c ] there was a priest named Zechariah of the priestly division of Abijah ; his wife was from the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elizabeth . ( C )
NABRE	Luke	1	6	Both were righteous in the eyes of God , observing all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly .
NABRE	Luke	1	7	But they had no child , [ d ] because Elizabeth was barren and both were advanced in years . ( D )
NABRE	Luke	1	8	Once when he was serving as priest in his division ’ s turn before God ,
NABRE	Luke	1	9	according to the practice of the priestly service , he was chosen by lot to enter the sanctuary of the Lord to burn incense . ( E )
NABRE	Luke	1	10	Then , when the whole assembly of the people was praying outside at the hour of the incense offering ,
NABRE	Luke	1	11	the angel of the Lord appeared to him , standing at the right of the altar of incense .
NABRE	Luke	1	12	Zechariah was troubled by what he saw , and fear came upon him .
NABRE	Luke	1	13	But the angel said to him , “ Do not be afraid , [ e ] Zechariah , because your prayer has been heard . Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son , and you shall name him John . ( F )
NABRE	Luke	1	14	And you will have joy and gladness , and many will rejoice at his birth ,

NABRE	Luke	1	18	. When Mary asks a similar question in Lk 1:34 , unlike Zechariah who was punished for his doubt , she , in spite of her doubt , is praised and reassured ( Lk 1:35–37 ) . - 1:26–38 The announcement to Mary of the birth of Jesus is parallel to the announcement to Zechariah of the birth of John . In both the angel Gabriel appears to the parent who is troubled by the vision ( Lk 1:11–12 , 26–29 ) and then told by the angel not to fear ( Lk 1:13 ,
NABRE	Luke	1	19	such as the coming of the day of the Lord and the dawning of the messianic era , Luke is presenting his interpretation of the significance of the births of John and Jesus . - 1:20 You will be speechless and unable to talk : Zechariah ’ s becoming mute is the sign given in response to his question in v
NABRE	Luke	1	20	. - 1:68–79 Like the canticle of Mary ( Lk 1:46–55 ) the canticle of Zechariah is only loosely connected with its context . Apart from Lk 1:76–77 , the hymn in speaking of a horn for our salvation ( Lk 1:69 ) and the daybreak from on high ( Lk 1:78 ) applies more closely to Jesus and his work than to John . Again like Mary ’ s canticle , it is largely composed of phrases taken from the Greek Old Testament and may have been a Jewish Christian hymn of praise that Luke adapted to fit the present context by inserting Lk 1:76–77 to give Zechariah ’ s reply to the question asked in Lk 1:66 . - 1:69 A horn for our salvation : the horn is a common Old Testament figure for strength ( Ps 18:3 ; 75:5–6 ; 89:18 ; 112:9 ; 148:14 ) . This description is applied to God in Ps 18:3 and is here transferred to Jesus . The connection of the phrase with the house of David gives the title messianic overtones and may indicate an allusion to a phrase in Hannah ’ s song of praise (
NABRE	Luke	1	21	Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah and were amazed that he stayed so long in the sanctuary .
NABRE	Luke	1	22	But when he came out , he was unable to speak to them , and they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary . He was gesturing to them but remained mute .
NABRE	Luke	1	23	Then , when his days of ministry were completed , he went home .
NABRE	Luke	1	24	After this time his wife Elizabeth conceived , and she went into seclusion for five months , saying ,
NABRE	Luke	1	25	“ So has the Lord done for me at a time when he has seen fit to take away my disgrace before others. ” ( K ) Announcement of the Birth of Jesus . [ j ]
NABRE	Luke	1	26	In the sixth month , the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth ,
NABRE	Luke	1	27	to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph , of the house of David , and the virgin ’ s name was Mary . ( L )
NABRE	Luke	1	28	And coming to her , he said , “ Hail , favored one ! The Lord is with you. ” ( M )
NABRE	Luke	1	29	But she was greatly troubled at what was said and pondered what sort of greeting this might be .
NABRE	Luke	1	30	) . After the announcement is made ( Lk 1:14–17 , 31–33 ) the parent objects ( Lk 1:18 ,
NABRE	Luke	1	31	( N ) Behold , you will conceive in your womb and bear a son , and you shall name him Jesus .
NABRE	Luke	1	32	( O ) He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High , [ k ] and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father ,
NABRE	Luke	1	33	and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever , and of his kingdom there will be no end. ” ( P )
NABRE	Luke	1	34	) and a sign is given to confirm the announcement ( Lk 1:20 ,
NABRE	Luke	1	35	) . - 1:32 Son of the Most High : cf . Lk 1:76 where John is described as “ prophet of the Most High. ” “ Most High ” is a title for God commonly used by Luke ( Lk 1:35 ,
NABRE	Luke	1	36	) . The particular focus of the announcement of the birth of Jesus is on his identity as Son of David ( Lk 1:32–33 ) and Son of God ( Lk 1:32 ,
NABRE	Luke	1	37	B.C . He continued as king until his death in
NABRE	Luke	1	38	Mary said , “ Behold , I am the handmaid of the Lord . May it be done to me according to your word. ” Then the angel departed from her . Mary Visits Elizabeth .

NABRE	Luke	1	41	When Elizabeth heard Mary ’ s greeting , the infant leaped in her womb , and Elizabeth , filled with the holy Spirit , ( S )
NABRE	Luke	1	42	cried out in a loud voice and said , “ Most blessed are you among women , and blessed is the fruit of your womb . ( T )
NABRE	Luke	1	43	And how does this happen to me , that the mother of my Lord [ n ] should come to me ?
NABRE	Luke	1	44	For at the moment the sound of your greeting reached my ears , the infant in my womb leaped for joy .

NABRE	Luke	1	48	) may have been a Jewish Christian hymn that Luke found appropriate at this point in his story . Even if not composed by Luke , it fits in well with themes found elsewhere in Luke : joy and exultation in the Lord ; the lowly being singled out for God ’ s favor ; the reversal of human fortunes ; the fulfillment of Old Testament promises . The loose connection between the hymn and the context is further seen in the fact that a few Old Latin manuscripts identify the speaker of the hymn as Elizabeth , even though the overwhelming textual evidence makes Mary the speaker . - 1:57–66 The birth and circumcision of John above all emphasize John ’ s incorporation into the people of Israel by the sign of the covenant ( Gn 17:1–12 ) . The narrative of John ’ s circumcision also prepares the way for the subsequent description of the circumcision of Jesus in Lk 2:21 . At the beginning of his two-volume work Luke shows those who play crucial roles in the inauguration of Christianity to be wholly a part of the people of Israel . At the end of the Acts of the Apostles ( Acts 21:20 ; 22:3 ; 23:6–9 ; 24:14–16 ; 26:2–8 , 22–23 ) he will argue that Christianity is the direct descendant of Pharisaic Judaism . - 1:59 The practice of Palestinian Judaism at this time was to name the child at birth ; moreover , though naming a male child after the father is not completely unknown , the usual practice was to name the child after the grandfather ( see Lk 1:61 ) . The naming of the child John and Zechariah ’ s recovery from his loss of speech should be understood as fulfilling the angel ’ s announcement to Zechariah in Lk 1:13 ,

NABRE	Luke	1	59	[ r ] When they came on the eighth day to circumcise ( AH ) the child , they were going to call him Zechariah after his father ,

NABRE	Luke	1	61	But they answered her , “ There is no one among your relatives who has this name. ”
NABRE	Luke	1	62	So they made signs , asking his father what he wished him to be called .

NABRE	Luke	1	76	; 6:35 ; 8:28 ; Acts 7:48 ; 16:17 ) . - 1:34 Mary ’ s questioning response is a denial of sexual relations and is used by Luke to lead to the angel ’ s declaration about the Spirit ’ s role in the conception of this child ( Lk 1:35 ) . According to Luke , the virginal conception of Jesus takes place through the holy Spirit , the power of God , and therefore Jesus has a unique relationship to Yahweh : he is Son of God . - 1:36–37 The sign given to Mary in confirmation of the angel ’ s announcement to her is the pregnancy of her aged relative Elizabeth . If a woman past the childbearing age could become pregnant , why , the angel implies , should there be doubt about Mary ’ s pregnancy , for nothing will be impossible for God . - 1:43 Even before his birth , Jesus is identified in Luke as the Lord . - 1:45 Blessed are you who believed : Luke portrays Mary as a believer whose faith stands in contrast to the disbelief of Zechariah ( Lk 1:20 ) . Mary ’ s role as believer in the infancy narrative should be seen in connection with the explicit mention of her presence among “ those who believed ” after the resurrection at the beginning of the Acts of the Apostles ( Acts 1:14 ) . - 1:46–55 Although Mary is praised for being the mother of the Lord and because of her belief , she reacts as the servant in a psalm of praise , the Magnificat . Because there is no specific connection of the canticle to the context of Mary ’ s pregnancy and her visit to Elizabeth , the Magnificat ( with the possible exception of v

NABRE	Luke	1	80	The child grew and became strong in spirit , and he was in the desert until the day of his manifestation to Israel . ( AU ) Footnotes - 1:1–4 The Gospel according to Luke is the only one of the synoptic gospels to begin with a literary prologue . Making use of a formal , literary construction and vocabulary , the author writes the prologue in imitation of Hellenistic Greek writers and , in so doing , relates his story about Jesus to contemporaneous Greek and Roman literature . Luke is not only interested in the words and deeds of Jesus , but also in the larger context of the birth , ministry , death , and resurrection of Jesus as the fulfillment of the promises of God in the Old Testament . As a second- or third-generation Christian , Luke acknowledges his debt to earlier eyewitnesses and ministers of the word , but claims that his contribution to this developing tradition is a complete and accurate account , told in an orderly manner , and intended to provide Theophilus ( “ friend of God , ” literally ) and other readers with certainty about earlier teachings they have received . - 1:5–2:52 Like the Gospel according to Matthew , this gospel opens with an infancy narrative , a collection of stories about the birth and childhood of Jesus . The narrative uses early Christian traditions about the birth of Jesus , traditions about the birth and circumcision of John the Baptist , and canticles such as the Magnificat ( Lk 1:46–55 ) and Benedictus ( Lk 1:67–79 ) , composed of phrases drawn from the Greek Old Testament . It is largely , however , the composition of Luke who writes in imitation of Old Testament birth stories , combining historical and legendary details , literary ornamentation and interpretation of scripture , to answer in advance the question , “ Who is Jesus Christ ? ” The focus of the narrative , therefore , is primarily christological . In this section Luke announces many of the themes that will become prominent in the rest of the gospel : the centrality of Jerusalem and the temple , the journey motif , the universality of salvation , joy and peace , concern for the lowly , the importance of women , the presentation of Jesus as savior , Spirit-guided revelation and prophecy , and the fulfillment of Old Testament promises . The account presents parallel scenes ( diptychs ) of angelic announcements of the birth of John the Baptist and of Jesus , and of the birth , circumcision , and presentation of John and Jesus . In this parallelism , the ascendency of Jesus over John is stressed : John is prophet of the Most High ( Lk 1:76 ) ; Jesus is Son of the Most High ( Lk 1:32 ) . John is great in the sight of the Lord ( Lk 1:15 ) ; Jesus will be Great ( a LXX attribute , used absolutely , of God ) ( Lk 1:32 ) . John will go before the Lord ( Lk 1:16–17 ) ; Jesus will be Lord ( Lk 1:43 ; 2:11 ) . - 1:5 In the days of Herod , King of Judea : Luke relates the story of salvation history to events in contemporary world history . Here and in Lk 3:1–2 he connects his narrative with events in Palestinian history ; in Lk 2:1–2 and Lk 3:1 he casts the Jesus story in the light of events of Roman history . Herod the Great , the son of the Idumean Antipater , was declared “ King of Judea ” by the Roman Senate in

NABRE	Luke	2	1	Sm 1:24–28 , where Hannah offers the child Samuel for sanctuary services . The law further stipulated ( Nm 3:47–48 ) that the firstborn son should be redeemed by the parents through their payment of five shekels to a member of a priestly family . About this legal requirement Luke is silent . - 2:25 Awaiting the consolation of Israel : Simeon here and later Anna who speak about the child to all who were awaiting the redemption of Jerusalem represent the hopes and expectations of faithful and devout Jews who at this time were looking forward to the restoration of God ’ s rule in Israel . The birth of Jesus brings these hopes to fulfillment . - 2:35 ( And you yourself a sword will pierce ) : Mary herself will not be untouched by the various reactions to the role of Jesus ( Lk 2:34 ) . Her blessedness as mother of the Lord will be challenged by her son who describes true blessedness as “ hearing the word of God and observing it ” ( Lk 11:27–28 and Lk 8:20–21 ) . - 2:41–52 This story ’ s concern with an incident from Jesus ’ youth is unique in the canonical gospel tradition . It presents Jesus in the role of the faithful Jewish boy , raised in the traditions of Israel , and fulfilling all that the law requires . With this episode , the infancy narrative ends just as it began , in the setting of the Jerusalem temple . - 2:49 I must be in my Father ’ s house : this phrase can also be translated , “ I must be about my Father ’ s work. ” In either translation , Jesus refers to God as his Father . His divine sonship , and his obedience to his heavenly Father ’ s will , take precedence over his ties to his family .

Luke may simply be combining Jesus ’ birth in Bethlehem with his vague recollection of a census under Quirinius ( see also Acts 5:37 ) to underline the significance of this birth for the whole Roman world : through this child born in Bethlehem peace and salvation come to the empire . - 2:1 Caesar Augustus : the reign of the Roman emperor Caesar Augustus is usually dated from

NABRE	Luke	2	13	And suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the angel , praising God and saying : The Visit of the Shepherds .
NABRE	Luke	2	15	When the angels went away from them to heaven , the shepherds said to one another , “ Let us go , then , to Bethlehem to see this thing that has taken place , which the Lord has made known to us. ”
NABRE	Luke	2	16	So they went in haste and found Mary and Joseph , and the infant lying in the manger .
NABRE	Luke	2	17	When they saw this , they made known the message that had been told them about this child .

Wrapped him in swaddling clothes : there may be an allusion here to the birth of another descendant of David , his son Solomon , who though a great king was wrapped in swaddling clothes like any other infant ( Wis 7:4–6 ) . Laid him in a manger : a feeding trough for animals . A possible allusion to Is 1:3 LXX . - 2:8–20 The announcement of Jesus ’ birth to the shepherds is in keeping with Luke ’ s theme that the lowly are singled out as the recipients of God ’ s favors and blessings ( see also Lk 1:48 ,
NABRE	Luke	2	28	B.C. ,
NABRE	Luke	2	29	“ Now , Master , you may let your servant go in peace , according to your word ,

NABRE	Luke	2	33	The child ’ s father and mother were amazed at what was said about him ;

In this respect , they are described in a fashion similar to the parents of John ( Lk 1:6 ) and Simeon ( Lk 2:25 ) and Anna ( Lk 2:36–37 ) . - 2:22 Their purification : syntactically , their must refer to Mary and Joseph , even though the Mosaic law never mentions the purification of the husband . Recognizing the problem , some Western scribes have altered the text to read “ his purification , ” understanding the presentation of Jesus in the temple as a form of purification ; the Vulgate version has a Latin form that could be either “ his ” or “ her. ” According to the Mosaic law ( Lv 12:2–8 ) , the woman who gives birth to a boy is unable for forty days to touch anything sacred or to enter the temple area by reason of her legal impurity . At the end of this period she is required to offer a year-old lamb as a burnt offering and a turtledove or young pigeon as an expiation of sin . The woman who could not afford a lamb offered instead two turtledoves or two young pigeons , as Mary does here . They took him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord : as the firstborn son ( Lk 2:7 ) Jesus was consecrated to the Lord as the law required ( Ex 13:2 ,

NABRE	Luke	2	52	) . - 2:11 The basic message of the infancy narrative is contained in the angel ’ s announcement : this child is savior , Messiah , and Lord . Luke is the only synoptic gospel writer to use the title savior for Jesus ( Lk 2:11 ; Acts 5:31 ; 13:23 ; see also Lk 1:69 ; 19:9 ; Acts 4:12 ) . As savior , Jesus is looked upon by Luke as the one who rescues humanity from sin and delivers humanity from the condition of alienation from God . The title christos , “ Christ , ” is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew māšîaḥ , “ Messiah , ” “ anointed one. ” Among certain groups in first-century Palestinian Judaism , the title was applied to an expected royal leader from the line of David who would restore the kingdom to Israel ( see Acts 1:6 ) . The political overtones of the title are played down in Luke and instead the Messiah of the Lord ( Lk 2:26 ) or the Lord ’ s anointed is the one who now brings salvation to all humanity , Jew and Gentile ( Lk 2:29–32 ) . Lord is the most frequently used title for Jesus in Luke and Acts . In the New Testament it is also applied to Yahweh , as it is in the Old Testament . When used of Jesus it points to his transcendence and dominion over humanity . - 2:14 On earth peace to those on whom his favor rests : the peace that results from the Christ event is for those whom God has favored with his grace . This reading is found in the oldest representatives of the Western and Alexandrian text traditions and is the preferred one ; the Byzantine text tradition , on the other hand , reads : “ on earth peace , good will toward men. ” The peace of which Luke ’ s gospel speaks ( Lk 2:14 ; 7:50 ; 8:48 ; 10:5–6 ; 19:38 ,
NABRE	Luke	2	14	. According to Greek inscriptions , Augustus was regarded in the Roman Empire as “ savior ” and “ god , ” and he was credited with establishing a time of peace , the pax Augusta , throughout the Roman world during his long reign . It is not by chance that Luke relates the birth of Jesus to the time of Caesar Augustus : the real savior ( Lk 2:11 ) and peace-bearer ( Lk 2:14 ; see also Lk 19:38 ) is the child born in Bethlehem . The great emperor is simply God ’ s agent ( like the Persian king Cyrus in Is 44:28–45:1 ) who provides the occasion for God ’ s purposes to be accomplished . The whole world : that is , the whole Roman world : Rome , Italy , and the Roman provinces . - 2:7 Firstborn son : the description of Jesus as firstborn son does not necessarily mean that Mary had other sons . It is a legal description indicating that Jesus possessed the rights and privileges of the firstborn son ( Gn

NABRE	Luke	3	10	And the crowds asked him , “ What then should we do ? ”
NABRE	Luke	3	11	He said to them in reply , “ Whoever has two tunics should share with the person who has none . And whoever has food should do likewise. ”

NABRE	Luke	3	19	) , possibly because of the continuing influence of Annas or because the title continued to be used for the ex-high priest . The word of God came to John : Luke is alone among the New Testament writers in associating the preaching of John with a call from God . Luke is thereby identifying John with the prophets whose ministries began with similar calls . In Lk 7:26 John will be described as “ more than a prophet ” ; he is also the precursor of Jesus ( Lk 7:27 ) , a transitional figure inaugurating the period of the fulfillment of prophecy and promise . - 3:3 See note on Mt 3:2 . - 3:4 The Essenes from Qumran used the same passage to explain why their community was in the desert studying and observing the law and the prophets ( 1QS 8:12–15 ) . - 3:16 He will baptize you with the holy Spirit and fire : in contrast to John ’ s baptism with water , Jesus is said to baptize with the holy Spirit and with fire . From the point of view of the early Christian community , the Spirit and fire must have been understood in the light of the fire symbolism of the pouring out of the Spirit at Pentecost ( Acts 2:1–4 ) ; but as part of John ’ s preaching , the Spirit and fire should be related to their purifying and refining characteristics ( Ez 36:25–27 ; Mal 3:2–3 ) . See note on Mt 3:11 . - 3:17 Winnowing fan : see note on Mt 3:12 . - 3:19–20 Luke separates the ministry of John the Baptist from that of Jesus by reporting the imprisonment of John before the baptism of Jesus ( Lk 3:21–22 ) . Luke uses this literary device to serve his understanding of the periods of salvation history . With John the Baptist , the time of promise , the period of Israel , comes to an end ; with the baptism of Jesus and the descent of the Spirit upon him , the time of fulfillment , the period of Jesus , begins . In his second volume , the Acts of the Apostles , Luke will introduce the third epoch in salvation history , the period of the church . - 3:21–22 This episode in Luke focuses on the heavenly message identifying Jesus as Son and , through the allusion to Is 42:1 , as Servant of Yahweh . The relationship of Jesus to the Father has already been announced in the infancy narrative ( Lk 1:32 ,

Elsewhere in Luke ’ s writings ( Lk 4:18 ; Acts 10:38 ) , this incident will be interpreted as a type of anointing of Jesus . - 3:21 Was praying : Luke regularly presents Jesus at prayer at important points in his ministry : here at his baptism ; at the choice of the Twelve ( Lk 6:12 ) ; before Peter ’ s confession ( Lk 9:18 ) ; at the transfiguration ( Lk 9:28 ) ; when he teaches his disciples to pray ( Lk 11:1 ) ; at the Last Supper ( Lk 22:32 ) ; on the Mount of Olives ( Lk 22:41 ) ; on the cross ( Lk 23:46 ) . - 3:22 You are my beloved Son ; with you I am well pleased : this is the best attested reading in the Greek manuscripts . The Western reading , “ You are my Son , this day I have begotten you , ” is derived from Ps 2:7 . - 3:23–38 Whereas Mt 1:2 begins the genealogy of Jesus with Abraham to emphasize Jesus ’ bonds with the people of Israel , Luke ’ s universalism leads him to trace the descent of Jesus beyond Israel to Adam and beyond that to God ( Lk 3:38 ) to stress again Jesus ’ divine sonship . - 3:31 The son of Nathan , the son of David : in keeping with Jesus ’ prophetic role in Luke and Acts ( e.g. , Lk 7:16 ,

Footnotes - 3:1–20 Although Luke is indebted in this section to his sources , the Gospel of Mark and a collection of sayings of John the Baptist , he has clearly marked this introduction to the ministry of Jesus with his own individual style . Just as the gospel began with a long periodic sentence ( Lk 1:1–4 ) , so too this section ( Lk 3:1–2 ) . He casts the call of John the Baptist in the form of an Old Testament prophetic call ( Lk 3:2 ) and extends the quotation from Isaiah found in Mk 1:3 ( Is 40:3 ) by the addition of Is 40:4–5 in Lk 3:5–6 . In doing so , he presents his theme of the universality of salvation , which he has announced earlier in the words of Simeon ( Lk 2:30–32 ) . Moreover , in describing the expectation of the people ( Lk 3:15 ) , Luke is characterizing the time of John ’ s preaching in the same way as he had earlier described the situation of other devout Israelites in the infancy narrative ( Lk 2:25–26 , 37–38 ) . In Lk 3:7–18 Luke presents the preaching of John the Baptist who urges the crowds to reform in view of the coming wrath ( Lk 3:7 ,

NABRE	Luke	4	24	; 12:16–21 ; 14:12–14 ; 16:19–26 ; 19:8 ) . At times , the poor in Luke ’ s gospel are associated with the downtrodden , the oppressed and afflicted , the forgotten and the neglected ( Lk 4:18 ; 6:20–22 ; 7:22 ; 14:12–14 ) , and it is they who accept Jesus ’ message of salvation . - 4:21 Today this scripture passage is fulfilled in your hearing : this sermon inaugurates the time of fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy . Luke presents the ministry of Jesus as fulfilling Old Testament hopes and expectations ( Lk 7:22 ) ; for Luke , even Jesus ’ suffering , death , and resurrection are done in fulfillment of the scriptures ( Lk 24:25–27 , 44–46 ; Acts 3:18 ) . - 4:23 The things that we heard were done in Capernaum : Luke ’ s source for this incident reveals an awareness of an earlier ministry of Jesus in Capernaum that Luke has not yet made use of because of his transposition of this Nazareth episode to the beginning of Jesus ’ Galilean ministry . It is possible that by use of the future tense you will quote me… , Jesus is being portrayed as a prophet . - 4:25–26 The references to Elijah and Elisha serve several purposes in this episode : they emphasize Luke ’ s portrait of Jesus as a prophet like Elijah and Elisha ; they help to explain why the initial admiration of the people turns to rejection ; and they provide the scriptural justification for the future Christian mission to the Gentiles . - 4:26 A widow in Zarephath in the land of Sidon : like Naaman the Syrian in Lk 4:27 , a non-Israelite becomes the object of the prophet ’ s ministry . - 4:31–44 The next several incidents in Jesus ’ ministry take place in Capernaum and are based on Luke ’ s source , Mk 1:21–39 . To the previous portrait of Jesus as prophet ( Lk 4:16–30 ) they now add a presentation of him as teacher ( Lk 4:31–32 ) , exorcist ( Lk 4:32–37 ,

NABRE	Luke	4	28	When the people in the synagogue heard this , they were all filled with fury .
NABRE	Luke	4	29	They rose up , drove him out of the town , and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town had been built , to hurl him down headlong .

Have you come to destroy us ? : the question reflects the current belief that before the day of the Lord control over humanity would be wrested from the evil spirits , evil destroyed , and God ’ s authority over humanity reestablished . The synoptic gospel tradition presents Jesus carrying out this task . - 4:38 The house of Simon : because of Luke ’ s arrangement of material , the reader has not yet been introduced to Simon ( cf . Mk 1:16–18 , 29–31 ) . Situated as it is before the call of Simon ( Lk 5:1–11 ) , it helps the reader to understand Simon ’ s eagerness to do what Jesus says ( Lk 5:5 ) and to follow him ( Lk 5:11 ) . - 4:41 They knew that he was the Messiah : that is , the Christ ( see note on Lk 2:11 ) . - 4:42 They tried to prevent him from leaving them : the reaction of these strangers in Capernaum is presented in contrast to the reactions of those in his hometown who rejected him ( Lk 4:28–30 ) . - 4:44 In the synagogues of Judea : instead of Judea , which is the best reading of the manuscript tradition , the Byzantine text tradition and other manuscripts read “ Galilee , ” a reading that harmonizes Luke with Mt 4:23 and Mk 1:39 . Up to this point Luke has spoken only of a ministry of Jesus in Galilee . Luke may be using Judea to refer to the land of Israel , the territory of the Jews , and not to a specific portion of it .

Just as the Spirit is prominent at this early stage of Jesus ’ ministry ( Lk 4:1 ,
NABRE	Luke	4	53	) . - 4:14 News of him spread : a Lucan theme ; see Lk 4:37 ; 5:15 ; 7:17 . - 4:16–30 Luke has transposed to the beginning of Jesus ’ ministry an incident from his Marcan source , which situated it near the end of the Galilean ministry ( Mk 6:1–6a ) . In doing so , Luke turns the initial admiration ( Lk 4:22 ) and subsequent rejection of Jesus ( Lk 4:28–29 ) into a foreshadowing of the whole future ministry of Jesus . Moreover , the rejection of Jesus in his own hometown hints at the greater rejection of him by Israel ( Acts 13:46 ) . - 4:16 According to his custom : Jesus ’ practice of regularly attending synagogue is carried on by the early Christians ’ practice of meeting in the temple ( Acts 2:46 ; 3:1 ; 5:12 ) . - 4:18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he has anointed me : see note on Lk 3:21–22 . As this incident develops , Jesus is portrayed as a prophet whose ministry is compared to that of the prophets Elijah and Elisha . Prophetic anointings are known in first-century Palestinian Judaism from the Qumran literature that speaks of prophets as God ’ s anointed ones . To bring glad tidings to the poor : more than any other gospel writer Luke is concerned with Jesus ’ attitude toward the economically and socially poor ( see Lk 6:20 ,

NABRE	Luke	5	15	The report about him spread all the more , and great crowds assembled to listen to him and to be cured of their ailments ,
NABRE	Luke	5	16	but he would withdraw to deserted places to pray . ( H ) The Healing of a Paralytic . ( I )
NABRE	Luke	5	17	[ e ] One day as Jesus was teaching , Pharisees [ f ] and teachers of the law were sitting there who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem , and the power of the Lord was with him for healing .
NABRE	Luke	5	18	And some men brought on a stretcher a man who was paralyzed ; they were trying to bring him in and set [ him ] in his presence .
NABRE	Luke	5	19	But not finding a way to bring him in because of the crowd , they went up on the roof and lowered him on the stretcher through the tiles [ g ] into the middle in front of Jesus .
NABRE	Luke	5	20	When he saw their faith , he said , “ As for you , your sins are forgiven. ” [ h ]
NABRE	Luke	5	21	Then the scribes [ i ] and Pharisees began to ask themselves , “ Who is this who speaks blasphemies ? Who but God alone can forgive sins ? ” ( J )
NABRE	Luke	5	22	Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them in reply , “ What are you thinking in your hearts ? ( K )
NABRE	Luke	5	23	Which is easier , to say , ‘ Your sins are forgiven , ’ or to say , ‘ Rise and walk ’ ?
NABRE	Luke	5	24	[ j ] ( L ) But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ” —he said to the man who was paralyzed , “ I say to you , rise , pick up your stretcher , and go home. ”
NABRE	Luke	5	25	He stood up immediately before them , picked up what he had been lying on , and went home , glorifying God .
NABRE	Luke	5	26	Then astonishment seized them all and they glorified God , and , struck with awe , they said , “ We have seen incredible things today. ” The Call of Levi . ( M )
NABRE	Luke	5	27	After this he went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the customs post . He said to him , “ Follow me. ”
NABRE	Luke	5	28	And leaving everything behind , [ k ] he got up and followed him .
NABRE	Luke	5	29	( N ) Then Levi gave a great banquet for him in his house , and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were at table with them .
NABRE	Luke	5	30	The Pharisees and their scribes complained to his disciples , saying , “ Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners ? ”
NABRE	Luke	5	31	Jesus said to them in reply , “ Those who are healthy do not need a physician , but the sick do .
NABRE	Luke	5	32	I have not come to call the righteous to repentance but sinners. ” The Question About Fasting . ( O )
NABRE	Luke	5	33	And they said to him , “ The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers , and the disciples of the Pharisees do the same ; but yours eat and drink. ”
NABRE	Luke	5	34	[ l ] Jesus answered them , “ Can you make the wedding guests [ m ] fast while the bridegroom is with them ?
NABRE	Luke	5	35	But the days will come , and when the bridegroom is taken away from them , then they will fast in those days. ”
NABRE	Luke	5	36	[ n ] And he also told them a parable . “ No one tears a piece from a new cloak to patch an old one . Otherwise , he will tear the new and the piece from it will not match the old cloak .
NABRE	Luke	5	37	Likewise , no one pours new wine into old wineskins . Otherwise , the new wine will burst the skins , and it will be spilled , and the skins will be ruined .
NABRE	Luke	5	38	Rather , new wine must be poured into fresh wineskins .
NABRE	Luke	5	39	[ And ] no one who has been drinking old wine desires new , for he says , ‘ The old is good. ’ ” [ o ] Footnotes - 5:1–11 This incident has been transposed from his source , Mk 1:16–20 , which places it immediately after Jesus makes his appearance in Galilee . By this transposition Luke uses this example of Simon ’ s acceptance of Jesus to counter the earlier rejection of him by his hometown people , and since several incidents dealing with Jesus ’ power and authority have already been narrated , Luke creates a plausible context for the acceptance of Jesus by Simon and his partners . Many commentators have noted the similarity between the wondrous catch of fish reported here ( Lk 4:4–9 ) and the post-resurrectional appearance of Jesus in Jn 21:1–11 . There are traces in Luke ’ s story that the post-resurrectional context is the original one : in Lk 4:8 Simon addresses Jesus as Lord ( a post-resurrectional title for Jesus—see Lk 24:34 ; Acts 2:36—that has been read back into the historical ministry of Jesus ) and recognizes himself as a sinner ( an appropriate recognition for one who has denied knowing Jesus—Lk 22:54–62 ) . As used by Luke , the incident looks forward to Peter ’ s leadership in Luke-Acts ( Lk 6:14 ; 9:20 ; 22:31–32 ; 24:34 ; Acts 1:15 ; 2:14–40 ; 10:11–18 ; 15:7–12 ) and symbolizes the future success of Peter as fisherman ( Acts 2:41 ) . - 5:11 They left everything : in Mk 1:16–20 and Mt 4:18–22 the fishermen who follow Jesus leave their nets and their father ; in Luke , they leave everything ( see also Lk 5:28 ; 12:33 ; 14:33 ; 18:22 ) , an indication of Luke ’ s theme of complete detachment from material possessions . - 5:12 Full of leprosy : see note on Mk 1:40 . - 5:14 Show yourself to the priest…what Moses prescribed : this is a reference to Lv 14:2–9 that gives detailed instructions for the purification of one who had been a victim of leprosy and thereby excluded from contact with others ( see Lv 13:45–46 ,
NABRE	Luke	5	49	; Nm 5:2–3 ) . That will be proof for them : see note on Mt 8:4 . - 5:17–6:11 From his Marcan source , Luke now introduces a series of controversies with Pharisees : controversy over Jesus ’ power to forgive sins ( Lk 5:17–26 ) ; controversy over his eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners ( Lk 5:27–32 ) ; controversy over not fasting ( Lk 5:33–36 ) ; and finally two episodes narrating controversies over observance of the sabbath ( Lk 5:1–11 ) . - 5:17 Pharisees : see note on Mt 3:7 . - 5:19 Through the tiles : Luke has adapted the story found in Mark to his non-Palestinian audience by changing “ opened up the roof ” ( Mk 2:4 , a reference to Palestinian straw and clay roofs ) to through the tiles , a detail that reflects the Hellenistic Greco-Roman house with tiled roof . - 5:20 As for you , your sins are forgiven : literally , “ O man , your sins are forgiven you. ” The connection between the forgiveness of sins and the cure of the paralytic reflects the belief of first-century Palestine ( based on the Old Testament : Ex 20:5 ; Dt 5:9 ) that sickness and infirmity are the result of sin , one ’ s own or that of one ’ s ancestors ( see also Lk 13:2 ; Jn 5:14 ; 9:2 ) . - 5:21 The scribes : see note on Mk 2:6 . - 5:24 See notes on Mt 9:6 and Mk 2:10 . - 5:28 Leaving everything behind : see note on Lk 5:11 . - 5:34–35 See notes on Mt 9:15 and Mk 2:19 . - 5:34 Wedding guests : literally , “ sons of the bridal chamber. ” - 5:36–39 See notes on Mt 9:16–17 and Mk 2:19 . - 5:39 The old is good : this saying is meant to be ironic and offers an explanation for the rejection by some of the new wine that Jesus offers : satisfaction with old forms will prevent one from sampling the new .

NABRE	Luke	6	6	( E ) On another sabbath he went into the synagogue and taught , and there was a man there whose right hand was withered .
NABRE	Luke	6	1	Cor 1:1 ; 9:1 ; Rom 16:7 ) . - 6:14 Simon , whom he named Peter : see note on Mk 3:16 . - 6:15 Simon who was called a Zealot : the Zealots were the instigators of the First Revolt of Palestinian Jews against Rome in A.D. 66–70 . Because the existence of the Zealots as a distinct group during the lifetime of Jesus is the subject of debate , the meaning of the identification of Simon as a Zealot is unclear . - 6:16 Judas Iscariot : the name Iscariot may mean “ man from Kerioth. ” - 6:17 The coastal region of Tyre and Sidon : not only Jews from Judea and Jerusalem , but even Gentiles from outside Palestine come to hear Jesus ( see Lk 2:31–32 ; 3:6 ; 4:24–27 ) . - 6:20–49 Luke ’ s “ Sermon on the Plain ” is the counterpart to Matthew ’ s “ Sermon on the Mount ” ( Mt 5:1–7:27 ) . It is addressed to the disciples of Jesus , and , like the sermon in Matthew , it begins with beatitudes ( Lk 6:20–22 ) and ends with the parable of the two houses ( Lk 6:46–49 ) . Almost all the words of Jesus reported by Luke are found in Matthew ’ s version , but because Matthew includes sayings that were related to specifically Jewish Christian problems ( e.g. , Mt 5:17–20 ; 6:1–8 , 16–18 ) that Luke did not find appropriate for his predominantly Gentile Christian audience , the “ Sermon on the Mount ” is considerably longer . Luke ’ s sermon may be outlined as follows : an introduction consisting of blessings and woes ( Lk 6:20–26 ) ; the love of one ’ s enemies ( Lk 6:27–36 ) ; the demands of loving one ’ s neighbor ( Lk 6:37–42 ) ; good deeds as proof of one ’ s goodness ( Lk 6:43–45 ) ; a parable illustrating the result of listening to and acting on the words of Jesus ( Lk 6:46–49 ) . At the core of the sermon is Jesus ’ teaching on the love of one ’ s enemies ( Lk 6:27–36 ) that has as its source of motivation God ’ s graciousness and compassion for all humanity ( Lk 6:35–36 ) and Jesus ’ teaching on the love of one ’ s neighbor ( Lk 6:37–42 ) that is characterized by forgiveness and generosity . - 6:20–26 The introductory portion of the sermon consists of blessings and woes that address the real economic and social conditions of humanity ( the poor—the rich ; the hungry—the satisfied ; those grieving—those laughing ; the outcast—the socially acceptable ) . By contrast , Matthew emphasizes the religious and spiritual values of disciples in the kingdom inaugurated by Jesus ( “ poor in spirit , ” Mt 5:3 ; “ hunger and thirst for righteousness , ” Mt 5:6 ) . In the sermon , blessed extols the fortunate condition of persons who are favored with the blessings of God ; the woes , addressed as they are to the disciples of Jesus , threaten God ’ s profound displeasure on those so blinded by their present fortunate situation that they do not recognize and appreciate the real values of God ’ s kingdom . In all the blessings and woes , the present condition of the persons addressed will be reversed in the future . - 6:27–36 See notes on Mt 5:43–48 and Mt 5:48 . - 6:37–42 See notes on Mt 7:1–12 ; 7:1 ; 7:5 . - 6:43–46 See notes on Mt 7:15–20 and 12:33 . - 6:47–49 See note on Mt 7:24–27 .

NABRE	Luke	6	2	Some Pharisees said , “ Why are you doing what is unlawful on the sabbath ? ”

In his defense of his disciples ’ conduct and his own charitable deed , Jesus argues that satisfying human needs such as hunger and performing works of mercy take precedence even over the sacred sabbath rest .

NABRE	Luke	7	1	Kgs 7:8–24 ) leads to the reaction of the crowd : “ A great prophet has arisen in our midst ” ( Lk 7:16 ) . - 7:18–23 In answer to John ’ s question , Are you the one who is to come ? —a probable reference to the return of the fiery prophet of reform , Elijah , “ before the day of the Lord comes , the great and terrible day ” ( Mal 3:23 ) —Jesus responds that his role is rather to bring the blessings spoken of in Is 61:1 to the oppressed and neglected of society ( Lk 7:22 ; cf . Lk 4:18 ) . - 7:23 Blessed is the one who takes no offense at me : this beatitude is pronounced on the person who recognizes Jesus ’ true identity in spite of previous expectations of what “ the one who is to come ” would be like . - 7:24–30 In his testimony to John , Jesus reveals his understanding of the relationship between them : John is the precursor of Jesus ( Lk 7:27 ) ; John is the messenger spoken of in Mal 3:1 who in Mal 3:23 is identified as Elijah . Taken with the previous episode , it can be seen that Jesus identifies John as precisely the person John envisioned Jesus to be : the Elijah who prepares the way for the coming of the day of the Lord . - 7:31–35 See note on Mt 11:16–19 . - 7:36–50 In this story of the pardoning of the sinful woman Luke presents two different reactions to the ministry of Jesus . A Pharisee , suspecting Jesus to be a prophet , invites Jesus to a festive banquet in his house , but the Pharisee ’ s self-righteousness leads to little forgiveness by God and consequently little love shown toward Jesus . The sinful woman , on the other hand , manifests a faith in God ( Lk 7:50 ) that has led her to seek forgiveness for her sins , and because so much was forgiven , she now overwhelms Jesus with her display of love ; cf . the similar contrast in attitudes in Lk 18:9–14 . The whole episode is a powerful lesson on the relation between forgiveness and love . - 7:36 Reclined at table : the normal posture of guests at a banquet . Other oriental banquet customs alluded to in this story include the reception by the host with a kiss ( Lk 7:45 ) , washing the feet of the guests ( Lk 7:44 ) , and the anointing of the guests ’ heads ( Lk 7:46 ) . - 7:41 Days ’ wages : one denarius is the normal daily wage of a laborer . - 7:47 Her many sins have been forgiven ; hence , she has shown great love : literally , “ her many sins have been forgiven , seeing that she has loved much. ” That the woman ’ s sins have been forgiven is attested by the great love she shows toward Jesus . Her love is the consequence of her forgiveness . This is also the meaning demanded by the parable in Lk 7:41–43 .

NABRE	Luke	7	2	A centurion [ c ] there had a slave who was ill and about to die , and he was valuable to him .
NABRE	Luke	7	3	When he heard about Jesus , he sent elders of the Jews to him , asking him to come and save the life of his slave .

NABRE	Luke	7	5	for he loves our nation and he built the synagogue for us. ”

NABRE	Luke	7	21	At that time he cured many of their diseases , sufferings , and evil spirits ; he also granted sight to many who were blind .
NABRE	Luke	7	22	And he said to them in reply , “ Go and tell John what you have seen and heard : the blind regain their sight , the lame walk , lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , the poor have the good news proclaimed to them . ( H )

NABRE	Luke	7	25	Then what did you go out to see ? Someone dressed in fine garments ? Those who dress luxuriously and live sumptuously are found in royal palaces .
NABRE	Luke	7	26	Then what did you go out to see ? A prophet ? Yes , I tell you , and more than a prophet . ( J )

NABRE	Luke	7	43	Simon said in reply , “ The one , I suppose , whose larger debt was forgiven. ” He said to him , “ You have judged rightly. ”
NABRE	Luke	7	44	Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon , “ Do you see this woman ? When I entered your house , you did not give me water for my feet , but she has bathed them with her tears and wiped them with her hair .
NABRE	Luke	7	45	You did not give me a kiss , but she has not ceased kissing my feet since the time I entered .
NABRE	Luke	7	46	You did not anoint my head with oil , but she anointed my feet with ointment .
NABRE	Luke	7	47	So I tell you , her many sins have been forgiven ; hence , she has shown great love . [ m ] But the one to whom little is forgiven , loves little. ”
NABRE	Luke	7	48	He said to her , “ Your sins are forgiven. ” ( R )
NABRE	Luke	7	49	The others at table said to themselves , “ Who is this who even forgives sins ? ” ( S )
NABRE	Luke	7	50	But he said to the woman , “ Your faith has saved you ; go in peace. ” Footnotes - 7:1–8:3 The episodes in this section present a series of reactions to the Galilean ministry of Jesus and reflect some of Luke ’ s particular interests : the faith of a Gentile ( Lk 7:1–10 ) ; the prophet Jesus ’ concern for a widowed mother ( Lk 7:11–17 ) ; the ministry of Jesus directed to the afflicted and unfortunate of Is 61:1 ( Lk 7:18–23 ) ; the relation between John and Jesus and their role in God ’ s plan for salvation ( Lk 7:24–35 ) ; a forgiven sinner ’ s manifestation of love ( Lk 7:36–50 ) ; the association of women with the ministry of Jesus ( Lk 8:1–3 ) . - 7:1–10 This story about the faith of the centurion , a Gentile who cherishes the Jewish nation ( Lk 7:5 ) , prepares for the story in Acts of the conversion by Peter of the Roman centurion Cornelius who is similarly described as one who is generous to the Jewish nation ( Acts 10:2 ) . See also Acts 10:34–35 in the speech of Peter : “ God shows no partiality…whoever fears him and acts righteously is acceptable to him. ” See also notes on Mt 8:5–13 and Jn 4:43–54 . - 7:2 A centurion : see note on Mt 8:5 . - 7:6 I am not worthy to have you enter under my roof : to enter the house of a Gentile was considered unclean for a Jew ; cf . Acts 10:28 . - 7:11–17 In the previous incident Jesus ’ power was displayed for a Gentile whose servant was dying ; in this episode it is displayed toward a widowed mother whose only son has already died . Jesus ’ power over death prepares for his reply to John ’ s disciples in Lk 7:22 : “ the dead are raised. ” This resuscitation in alluding to the prophet Elijah ’ s resurrection of the only son of a widow of Zarephath (

They parallel the same sequence of stories at Mk 4:35–5:43 . - 8:26 Gerasenes : other manuscripts read Gadarenes or Gergesenes . See also note on Mt 8:28 . Opposite Galilee : probably Gentile territory ( note the presence in the area of pigs—unclean animals to Jews ) and an indication that the person who receives salvation ( Lk 8:36 ) is a Gentile . - 8:30 What is your name ? : the question reflects the popular belief that knowledge of the spirit ’ s name brought control over the spirit . Legion : to Jesus ’ question the demon replies with a Latin word transliterated into Greek . The Roman legion at this period consisted of 5,000 to 6,000 foot soldiers ; hence the name implies a very large number of demons . - 8:31 Abyss : the place of the dead ( Rom 10:7 ) or the prison of Satan ( Rev 20:3 ) or the subterranean “ watery deep ” that symbolizes the chaos before the order imposed by creation ( Gn 1:2 ) . - 8:35 Sitting at his feet : the former demoniac takes the position of a disciple before the master ( Lk 10:39 ; Acts 22:3 ) . - 8:40–56 Two interwoven miracle stories , one a healing and the other a resuscitation , present Jesus as master over sickness and death . In the Lucan account , faith in Jesus is responsible for the cure ( Lk 8:48 ) and for the raising to life ( Lk 8:50 ) . - 8:42 An only daughter : cf . the son of the widow of Nain whom Luke describes as an “ only ” son ( Lk 7:12 ; see also Lk 9:38 ) . - 8:43 Afflicted with hemorrhages for twelve years : according to the Mosaic law ( Lv 15:25–30 ) this condition would render the woman unclean and unfit for contact with other people . - 8:52 Sleeping : her death is a temporary condition ; cf .

NABRE	Luke	8	5	“ A sower went out to sow his seed . And as he sowed , some seed fell on the path and was trampled , and the birds of the sky ate it up .
NABRE	Luke	8	6	Some seed fell on rocky ground , and when it grew , it withered for lack of moisture .
NABRE	Luke	8	7	Some seed fell among thorns , and the thorns grew with it and choked it .
NABRE	Luke	8	9	Then his disciples asked him what the meaning of this parable might be .
NABRE	Luke	8	10	He answered , “ Knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of God has been granted to you ; but to the rest , they are made known through parables so that ‘ they may look but not see , and hear but not understand. ’ ( F ) The Parable of the Sower Explained . [ d ]
NABRE	Luke	8	11	( G ) “ This is the meaning of the parable . The seed is the word of God . ( H )
NABRE	Luke	8	12	Those on the path are the ones who have heard , but the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts that they may not believe and be saved .
NABRE	Luke	8	13	Those on rocky ground are the ones who , when they hear , receive the word with joy , but they have no root ; they believe only for a time and fall away in time of trial .
NABRE	Luke	8	14	As for the seed that fell among thorns , they are the ones who have heard , but as they go along , they are choked by the anxieties and riches and pleasures of life , and they fail to produce mature fruit .
NABRE	Luke	8	15	But as for the seed that fell on rich soil , they are the ones who , when they have heard the word , embrace it with a generous and good heart , and bear fruit through perseverance . The Parable of the Lamp . [ e ]

NABRE	Luke	8	19	Then his mother and his brothers [ f ] came to him but were unable to join him because of the crowd .
NABRE	Luke	8	20	( N ) He was told , “ Your mother and your brothers are standing outside and they wish to see you. ”

NABRE	Luke	8	22	[ h ] One day he got into a boat with his disciples and said to them , “ Let us cross to the other side of the lake. ” So they set sail ,
NABRE	Luke	8	23	and while they were sailing he fell asleep . A squall blew over the lake , and they were taking in water and were in danger .
NABRE	Luke	8	24	They came and woke him saying , “ Master , master , we are perishing ! ” He awakened , rebuked the wind and the waves , and they subsided and there was a calm .
NABRE	Luke	8	25	Then he asked them , “ Where is your faith ? ” But they were filled with awe and amazed and said to one another , “ Who then is this , who commands even the winds and the sea , and they obey him ? ” The Healing of the Gerasene Demoniac . ( P )
NABRE	Luke	8	26	Then they sailed to the territory of the Gerasenes , [ i ] which is opposite Galilee .
NABRE	Luke	8	27	When he came ashore a man from the town who was possessed by demons met him . For a long time he had not worn clothes ; he did not live in a house , but lived among the tombs .
NABRE	Luke	8	28	( Q ) When he saw Jesus , he cried out and fell down before him ; in a loud voice he shouted , “ What have you to do with me , Jesus , son of the Most High God ? I beg you , do not torment me ! ”
NABRE	Luke	8	29	For he had ordered the unclean spirit to come out of the man . ( It had taken hold of him many times , and he used to be bound with chains and shackles as a restraint , but he would break his bonds and be driven by the demon into deserted places . )
NABRE	Luke	8	30	Then Jesus asked him , “ What is your name ? ” [ j ] He replied , “ Legion , ” because many demons had entered him .
NABRE	Luke	8	31	And they pleaded with him not to order them to depart to the abyss . [ k ]
NABRE	Luke	8	32	A herd of many swine was feeding there on the hillside , and they pleaded with him to allow them to enter those swine ; and he let them .
NABRE	Luke	8	33	The demons came out of the man and entered the swine , and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned .
NABRE	Luke	8	34	When the swineherds saw what had happened , they ran away and reported the incident in the town and throughout the countryside .
NABRE	Luke	8	35	People came out to see what had happened and , when they approached Jesus , they discovered the man from whom the demons had come out sitting at his feet . [ l ] He was clothed and in his right mind , and they were seized with fear .
NABRE	Luke	8	36	Those who witnessed it told them how the possessed man had been saved .
NABRE	Luke	8	37	The entire population of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them because they were seized with great fear . So he got into a boat and returned .
NABRE	Luke	8	38	The man from whom the demons had come out begged to remain with him , but he sent him away , saying ,
NABRE	Luke	8	39	“ Return home and recount what God has done for you. ” The man went off and proclaimed throughout the whole town what Jesus had done for him . Jairus ’ s Daughter and the Woman with a Hemorrhage . [ m ]
NABRE	Luke	8	40	( R ) When Jesus returned , the crowd welcomed him , for they were all waiting for him .
NABRE	Luke	8	41	And a man named Jairus , an official of the synagogue , came forward . He fell at the feet of Jesus and begged him to come to his house ,
NABRE	Luke	8	42	because he had an only daughter , [ n ] about twelve years old , and she was dying . As he went , the crowds almost crushed him .
NABRE	Luke	8	43	And a woman afflicted with hemorrhages for twelve years , [ o ] who [ had spent her whole livelihood on doctors and ] was unable to be cured by anyone ,
NABRE	Luke	8	44	came up behind him and touched the tassel on his cloak . Immediately her bleeding stopped .
NABRE	Luke	8	45	Jesus then asked , “ Who touched me ? ” While all were denying it , Peter said , “ Master , the crowds are pushing and pressing in upon you. ”
NABRE	Luke	8	46	But Jesus said , “ Someone has touched me ; for I know that power has gone out from me. ” ( S )
NABRE	Luke	8	47	When the woman realized that she had not escaped notice , she came forward trembling . Falling down before him , she explained in the presence of all the people why she had touched him and how she had been healed immediately .
NABRE	Luke	8	48	He said to her , “ Daughter , your faith has saved you ; go in peace. ” ( T )
NABRE	Luke	8	49	While he was still speaking , someone from the synagogue official ’ s house arrived and said , “ Your daughter is dead ; do not trouble the teacher any longer. ”
NABRE	Luke	8	50	On hearing this , Jesus answered him , “ Do not be afraid ; just have faith and she will be saved. ”
NABRE	Luke	8	51	When he arrived at the house he allowed no one to enter with him except Peter and John and James , and the child ’ s father and mother .
NABRE	Luke	8	52	[ p ] ( U ) All were weeping and mourning for her , when he said , “ Do not weep any longer , for she is not dead , but sleeping. ”
NABRE	Luke	8	53	And they ridiculed him , because they knew that she was dead .
NABRE	Luke	8	54	But he took her by the hand and called to her , “ Child , arise ! ”
NABRE	Luke	8	55	Her breath returned and she immediately arose . He then directed that she should be given something to eat .
NABRE	Luke	8	56	Her parents were astounded , and he instructed them to tell no one what had happened . Footnotes - 8:1–3 Luke presents Jesus as an itinerant preacher traveling in the company of the Twelve and of the Galilean women who are sustaining them out of their means . These Galilean women will later accompany Jesus on his journey to Jerusalem and become witnesses to his death ( Lk 23:49 ) and resurrection ( Lk 24:9–11 , where Mary Magdalene and Joanna are specifically mentioned ; cf . also Acts 1:14 ) . The association of women with the ministry of Jesus is most unusual in the light of the attitude of first-century Palestinian Judaism toward women . The more common attitude is expressed in Jn 4:27 , and early rabbinic documents caution against speaking with women in public . - 8:4–21 The focus in this section is on how one should hear the word of God and act on it . It includes the parable of the sower and its explanation ( Lk 8:4–15 ) , a collection of sayings on how one should act on the word that is heard ( Lk 8:16–18 ) , and the identification of the mother and brothers of Jesus as the ones who hear the word and act on it ( Lk 8:19–21 ) . See also notes on Mt 13:1–53 and Mk 4:1–34 . - 8:4–8 See note on Mt 13:3–8 . - 8:11–15 On the interpretation of the parable of the sower , see note on Mt 13:18–23 . - 8:16–18 These sayings continue the theme of responding to the word of God . Those who hear the word must become a light to others ( Lk 8:16 ) ; even the mysteries of the kingdom that have been made known to the disciples ( Lk 8:9–10 ) must come to light ( Lk 8:17 ) ; a generous and persevering response to the word of God leads to a still more perfect response to the word . - 8:19 His brothers : see note on Mk 6:3 . - 8:21 The family of Jesus is not constituted by physical relationship with him but by obedience to the word of God . In this , Luke agrees with the Marcan parallel ( Mk 3:31–35 ) , although by omitting Mk 3:33 and especially Mk 3:20–21 Luke has softened the Marcan picture of Jesus ’ natural family . Probably he did this because Mary has already been presented in Lk 1:38 as the obedient handmaid of the Lord who fulfills the requirement for belonging to the eschatological family of Jesus ; cf . also Lk 11:27–28 . - 8:22–56 This section records four miracles of Jesus that manifest his power and authority : (

NABRE	Luke	9	10	When the apostles returned , they explained to him what they had done . He took them and withdrew in private to a town called Bethsaida .
NABRE	Luke	9	11	The crowds , meanwhile , learned of this and followed him . He received them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God , and he healed those who needed to be cured .
NABRE	Luke	9	12	where the prophet Elijah takes the course of action Jesus rejects , and Jesus thereby rejects the identification of himself with Elijah . - 9:51 Days for his being taken up : like the reference to his exodus in Lk 9:31 this is probably a reference to all the events ( suffering , death , resurrection , ascension ) of his last days in Jerusalem . He resolutely determined : literally , “ he set his face. ” - 9:52 Samaritan : Samaria was the territory between Judea and Galilee west of the Jordan river . For ethnic and religious reasons , the Samaritans and the Jews were bitterly opposed to one another ( see Jn 4:9 ) . - 9:57–62 In these sayings Jesus speaks of the severity and the unconditional nature of Christian discipleship . Even family ties and filial obligations , such as burying one ’ s parents , can not distract one no matter how briefly from proclaiming the kingdom of God . The first two sayings are paralleled in Mt 8:19–22 ; see also notes there . - 9:60 Let the dead bury their dead : i.e. , let the spiritually dead ( those who do not follow ) bury their physically dead .

NABRE	Luke	9	13	( H ) He said to them , “ Give them some food yourselves. ” They replied , “ Five loaves and two fish are all we have , unless we ourselves go and buy food for all these people. ”
NABRE	Luke	9	14	Now the men there numbered about five thousand . Then he said to his disciples , “ Have them sit down in groups of [ about ] fifty. ”
NABRE	Luke	9	15	They did so and made them all sit down .

NABRE	Luke	9	22	; Lk 8:40–56 ) . - 9:3 Take nothing for the journey : the absolute detachment required of the disciple ( Lk 14:33 ) leads to complete reliance on God ( Lk 12:22–31 ) . - 9:5 Shake the dust from your feet : see note on Mt 10:14 . - 9:7–56 This section in which Luke gathers together incidents that focus on the identity of Jesus is introduced by a question that Herod is made to ask in this gospel : “ Who then is this about whom I hear such things ? ” ( Lk 9:9 ) In subsequent episodes , Luke reveals to the reader various answers to Herod ’ s question : Jesus is one in whom God ’ s power is present and who provides for the needs of God ’ s people ( Lk 9:10–17 ) ; Peter declares Jesus to be “ the Messiah of God ” ( Lk 9:18–21 ) ; Jesus says he is the suffering Son of Man ( Lk 9:22 , 43–45 ) ; Jesus is the Master to be followed , even to death ( Lk 9:23–27 ) ; Jesus is God ’ s son , his Chosen One ( Lk 9:28–36 ) . - 9:7 Herod the tetrarch : see note on Lk 3:1 . - 9:9 And he kept trying to see him : this indication of Herod ’ s interest in Jesus prepares for Lk 13:31–33 and for Lk 23:8–12 where Herod ’ s curiosity about Jesus ’ power to perform miracles remains unsatisfied . - 9:16 Then taking… : the actions of Jesus recall the institution of the Eucharist in Lk 22:19 ; see also note on Mt 14:19 . - 9:18–22 This incident is based on Mk 8:27–33 , but Luke has eliminated Peter ’ s refusal to accept Jesus as suffering Son of Man ( Mk 8:32 ) and the rebuke of Peter by Jesus ( Mk 8:33 ) . Elsewhere in the gospel , Luke softens the harsh portrait of Peter and the other apostles found in his Marcan source ( cf . Lk 22:39–46 , which similarly lacks a rebuke of Peter that occurs in the source , Mk 14:37–38 ) . - 9:18 When Jesus was praying in solitude : see note on Lk 3:21 . - 9:20 The Messiah of God : on the meaning of this title in first-century Palestinian Judaism , see notes on Lk 2:11 and on Mt 16:13–20 and Mk 8:27–30 . - 9:23 Daily : this is a Lucan addition to a saying of Jesus , removing the saying from a context that envisioned the imminent suffering and death of the disciple of Jesus ( as does the saying in Mk 8:34–35 ) to one that focuses on the demands of daily Christian existence . - 9:28–36 Situated shortly after the first announcement of the passion , death , and resurrection , this scene of Jesus ’ transfiguration provides the heavenly confirmation to Jesus ’ declaration that his suffering will end in glory ( Lk 9:32 ) ; see also notes on Mt 17:1–8 and Mk 9:2–8 . - 9:28 Up the mountain to pray : the “ mountain ” is the regular place of prayer in Luke ( see Lk 6:12 ; 22:39–41 ) . - 9:30 Moses and Elijah : the two figures represent the Old Testament law and the prophets . At the end of this episode , the heavenly voice will identify Jesus as the one to be listened to now ( Lk 9:35 ) . See also note on Mk 9:5 . - 9:31 His exodus that he was going to accomplish in Jerusalem : Luke identifies the subject of the conversation as the exodus of Jesus , a reference to the death , resurrection , and ascension of Jesus that will take place in Jerusalem , the city of destiny ( see Lk 9:51 ) . The mention of exodus , however , also calls to mind the Israelite Exodus from Egypt to the promised land . - 9:32 They saw his glory : the glory that is proper to God is here attributed to Jesus ( see Lk 24:26 ) . - 9:33 Let us make three tents : in a possible allusion to the feast of Tabernacles , Peter may be likening his joy on the occasion of the transfiguration to the joyful celebration of this harvest festival . - 9:34 Over them : it is not clear whether them refers to Jesus , Moses , and Elijah , or to the disciples . For the cloud casting its shadow , see note on Mk 9:7 . - 9:35 Like the heavenly voice that identified Jesus at his baptism prior to his undertaking the Galilean ministry ( Lk 3:22 ) , so too here before the journey to the city of destiny is begun ( Lk 9:51 ) the heavenly voice again identifies Jesus as Son . Listen to him : the two representatives of Israel of old depart ( Lk 9:33 ) and Jesus is left alone ( Lk 9:36 ) as the teacher whose words must be heeded ( see also Acts 3:22 ) . - 9:36 At that time : i.e. , before the resurrection . - 9:37–43a See note on Mk 9:14–29 . - 9:46–50 These two incidents focus on attitudes that are opposed to Christian discipleship : rivalry and intolerance of outsiders . - 9:51–18:14 The Galilean ministry of Jesus finishes with the previous episode and a new section of Luke ’ s gospel begins , the journey to Jerusalem . This journey is based on Mk 10:1–52 but Luke uses his Marcan source only in Lk 18:15–19:27 . Before that point he has inserted into his gospel a distinctive collection of sayings of Jesus and stories about him that he has drawn from Q , a collection of sayings of Jesus used also by Matthew , and from his own special traditions . All of the material collected in this section is loosely organized within the framework of a journey of Jesus to Jerusalem , the city of destiny , where his exodus ( suffering , death , resurrection , ascension ) is to take place ( Lk 9:31 ) , where salvation is accomplished , and from where the proclamation of God ’ s saving word is to go forth ( Lk 24:47 ; Acts 1:8 ) . Much of the material in the Lucan travel narrative is teaching for the disciples . During the course of this journey Jesus is preparing his chosen Galilean witnesses for the role they will play after his exodus ( Lk 9:31 ) : they are to be his witnesses to the people ( Acts 10:39 ; 13:31 ) and thereby provide certainty to the readers of Luke ’ s gospel that the teachings they have received are rooted in the teachings of Jesus ( Lk 1:1–4 ) . - 9:51–55 Just as the Galilean ministry began with a rejection of Jesus in his hometown , so too the travel narrative begins with the rejection of him by Samaritans . In this episode Jesus disassociates himself from the attitude expressed by his disciples that those who reject him are to be punished severely . The story alludes to

NABRE	Luke	9	25	What profit is there for one to gain the whole world yet lose or forfeit himself ?

NABRE	Luke	9	27	Truly I say to you , there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God. ” The Transfiguration of Jesus . [ l ]
NABRE	Luke	9	28	( Q ) About eight days after he said this , he took Peter , John , and James and went up the mountain to pray . [ m ]
NABRE	Luke	9	29	While he was praying his face changed in appearance and his clothing became dazzling white .
NABRE	Luke	9	30	And behold , two men were conversing with him , Moses and Elijah , [ n ]
NABRE	Luke	9	31	[ o ] ( R ) who appeared in glory and spoke of his exodus that he was going to accomplish in Jerusalem .
NABRE	Luke	9	32	Peter and his companions had been overcome by sleep , but becoming fully awake , they saw his glory [ p ] and the two men standing with him . ( S )
NABRE	Luke	9	33	As they were about to part from him , Peter said to Jesus , “ Master , it is good that we are here ; let us make three tents , [ q ] one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah. ” But he did not know what he was saying .
NABRE	Luke	9	34	[ r ] While he was still speaking , a cloud came and cast a shadow over them , and they became frightened when they entered the cloud .
NABRE	Luke	9	35	[ s ] ( T ) Then from the cloud came a voice that said , “ This is my chosen Son ; listen to him. ”
NABRE	Luke	9	36	After the voice had spoken , Jesus was found alone . They fell silent and did not at that time [ t ] tell anyone what they had seen . The Healing of a Boy with a Demon . [ u ]
NABRE	Luke	9	37	( U ) On the next day , when they came down from the mountain , a large crowd met him .

NABRE	Luke	9	52	[ z ] and he sent messengers ahead of him . ( AB ) On the way they entered a Samaritan village to prepare for his reception there ,
NABRE	Luke	9	53	but they would not welcome him because the destination of his journey was Jerusalem .
NABRE	Luke	9	54	When the disciples James and John saw this they asked , “ Lord , do you want us to call down fire from heaven to consume them ? ” ( AC )
NABRE	Luke	9	55	Jesus turned and rebuked them ,

NABRE	Luke	9	57	( AD ) As they were proceeding on their journey someone said to him , “ I will follow you wherever you go. ”

NABRE	Luke	10	17	The seventy [ -two ] returned rejoicing , and said , “ Lord , even the demons are subject to us because of your name. ”
NABRE	Luke	10	18	Jesus said , “ I have observed Satan fall like lightning [ h ] from the sky . ( P )

NABRE	Luke	10	25	[ j ] There was a scholar of the law [ k ] who stood up to test him and said , “ Teacher , what must I do to inherit eternal life ? ” ( X )
NABRE	Luke	10	26	Jesus said to him , “ What is written in the law ? How do you read it ? ”
NABRE	Luke	10	27	He said in reply , “ You shall love the Lord , your God , with all your heart , with all your being , with all your strength , and with all your mind , and your neighbor as yourself. ” ( Y )

NABRE	Luke	10	31	) here contrasted with heaven ; see also note on Mt 11:23 . - 10:18 I have observed Satan fall like lightning : the effect of the mission of the seventy-two is characterized by the Lucan Jesus as a symbolic fall of Satan . As the kingdom of God is gradually being established , evil in all its forms is being defeated ; the dominion of Satan over humanity is at an end . - 10:21 Revealed them to the childlike : a restatement of the theme announced in Lk 8:10 : the mysteries of the kingdom are revealed to the disciples . See also note on Mt 11:25–27 . - 10:25–37 In response to a question from a Jewish legal expert about inheriting eternal life , Jesus illustrates the superiority of love over legalism through the story of the good Samaritan . The law of love proclaimed in the “ Sermon on the Plain ” ( Lk 6:27–36 ) is exemplified by one whom the legal expert would have considered ritually impure ( see Jn 4:9 ) . Moreover , the identity of the “ neighbor ” requested by the legal expert ( Lk 10:29 ) turns out to be a Samaritan , the enemy of the Jew ( see note on Lk 9:52 ) . - 10:25 Scholar of the law : an expert in the Mosaic law , and probably a member of the group elsewhere identified as the scribes ( Lk 5:21 ) . - 10:31–32 Priest…Levite : those religious representatives of Judaism who would have been expected to be models of “ neighbor ” to the victim pass him by . - 10:38–42 The story of Martha and Mary further illustrates the importance of hearing the words of the teacher and the concern with women in Luke . - 10:39 Sat beside the Lord at his feet : it is remarkable for first-century Palestinian Judaism that a woman would assume the posture of a disciple at the master ’ s feet ( see also Lk 8:35 ; Acts 22:3 ) , and it reveals a characteristic attitude of Jesus toward women in this gospel ( see Lk 8:2–3 ) . - 10:42 There is need of only one thing : some ancient versions read , “ there is need of few things ” ; another important , although probably inferior , reading found in some manuscripts is , “ there is need of few things , or of one. ” Scripture texts , prefaces , introductions , footnotes and cross references used in this work are taken from the New American Bible , revised edition ©
NABRE	Luke	10	32	Likewise a Levite came to the place , and when he saw him , he passed by on the opposite side .
NABRE	Luke	10	33	But a Samaritan traveler who came upon him was moved with compassion at the sight .
NABRE	Luke	10	34	He approached the victim , poured oil and wine over his wounds and bandaged them . Then he lifted him up on his own animal , took him to an inn and cared for him .
NABRE	Luke	10	35	The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper with the instruction , ‘ Take care of him . If you spend more than what I have given you , I shall repay you on my way back. ’

NABRE	Luke	10	37	He answered , “ The one who treated him with mercy. ” Jesus said to him , “ Go and do likewise. ” Martha and Mary . [ m ]
NABRE	Luke	10	38	( AA ) As they continued their journey he entered a village where a woman whose name was Martha welcomed him .
NABRE	Luke	10	39	[ n ] She had a sister named Mary [ who ] sat beside the Lord at his feet listening to him speak .
NABRE	Luke	10	40	Martha , burdened with much serving , came to him and said , “ Lord , do you not care that my sister has left me by myself to do the serving ? Tell her to help me. ”

NABRE	Luke	10	42	[ o ] There is need of only one thing . Mary has chosen the better part and it will not be taken from her. ” Footnotes - 10:1–12 Only the Gospel of Luke contains two episodes in which Jesus sends out his followers on a mission : the first ( Lk 9:1–6 ) is based on the mission in Mk 6:6b–13 and recounts the sending out of the Twelve ; here in Lk 10:1–12 a similar report based on Q becomes the sending out of seventy-two in this gospel . The episode continues the theme of Jesus preparing witnesses to himself and his ministry . These witnesses include not only the Twelve but also the seventy-two who may represent the Christian mission in Luke ’ s own day . Note that the instructions given to the Twelve and to the seventy-two are similar and that what is said to the seventy-two in Lk 10:4 is directed to the Twelve in Lk 22:35 . - 10:1 Seventy [ -two ] : important representatives of the Alexandrian and Caesarean text types read “ seventy , ” while other important Alexandrian texts and Western readings have “ seventy-two. ” - 10:4 Carry no money bag…greet no one along the way : because of the urgency of the mission and the singlemindedness required of missionaries , attachment to material possessions should be avoided and even customary greetings should not distract from the fulfillment of the task . - 10:5 First say , ‘ Peace to this household ’ : see notes on Lk 2:14 and Mt 10:13 . - 10:6 A peaceful person : literally , “ a son of peace. ” - 10:13–16 The call to repentance that is a part of the proclamation of the kingdom brings with it a severe judgment for those who hear it and reject it . - 10:15 The netherworld : the underworld , the place of the dead ( Acts 2:27 ,

NABRE	Luke	11	37	( S ) After he had spoken , a Pharisee invited him to dine at his home . He entered and reclined at table to eat . ( T )
NABRE	Luke	11	38	The Pharisee was amazed to see that he did not observe the prescribed washing before the meal . ( U )
NABRE	Luke	11	39	The Lord said to him , “ Oh you Pharisees ! ( V ) Although you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish , inside you are filled with plunder and evil .

NABRE	Luke	11	53	When he left , the scribes and Pharisees began to act with hostility toward him and to interrogate him about many things , ( AE )
NABRE	Luke	11	54	for they were plotting to catch him at something he might say . ( AF ) Footnotes - 11:1–13 Luke presents three episodes concerned with prayer . The first ( Lk 11:1–4 ) recounts Jesus teaching his disciples the Christian communal prayer , the “ Our Father ” ; the second ( Lk 11:5–8 ) , the importance of persistence in prayer ; the third ( Lk 11:9–13 ) , the effectiveness of prayer . - 11:1–4 The Matthean form of the “ Our Father ” occurs in the “ Sermon on the Mount ” ( Mt 6:9–15 ) ; the shorter Lucan version is presented while Jesus is at prayer ( see note on Lk 3:21 ) and his disciples ask him to teach them to pray just as John taught his disciples to pray . In answer to their question , Jesus presents them with an example of a Christian communal prayer that stresses the fatherhood of God and acknowledges him as the one to whom the Christian disciple owes daily sustenance ( Lk 11:3 ) , forgiveness ( Lk 11:4 ) , and deliverance from the final trial ( Lk 11:4 ) . See also notes on Mt 6:9–13 . - 11:2 Your kingdom come : in place of this petition , some early church Fathers record : “ May your holy Spirit come upon us and cleanse us , ” a petition that may reflect the use of the “ Our Father ” in a baptismal liturgy . - 11:3–4 Daily bread : see note on Mt 6:11 . The final test : see note on Mt 6:13 . - 11:13 The holy Spirit : this is a Lucan editorial alteration of a traditional saying of Jesus ( see Mt 7:11 ) . Luke presents the gift of the holy Spirit as the response of the Father to the prayer of the Christian disciple . - 11:19 Your own people : the Greek reads “ your sons. ” Other Jewish exorcists ( see Acts 19:13–20 ) , who recognize that the power of God is active in the exorcism , would themselves convict the accusers of Jesus . See also note on Mt 12:27 . - 11:22 One stronger : i.e. , Jesus . Cf . Lk 3:16 where John the Baptist identifies Jesus as “ mightier than I. ” - 11:27–28 The beatitude in Lk 11:28 should not be interpreted as a rebuke of the mother of Jesus ; see note on Lk 8:21 . Rather , it emphasizes ( like Lk 2:35 ) that attentiveness to God ’ s word is more important than biological relationship to Jesus . - 11:29–32 The “ sign of Jonah ” in Luke is the preaching of the need for repentance by a prophet who comes from afar . Cf . Mt 12:38–42 ( and see notes there ) where the “ sign of Jonah ” is interpreted by Jesus as his death and resurrection . - 11:37–54 This denunciation of the Pharisees ( Lk 11:39–44 ) and the scholars of the law ( Lk 11:45–52 ) is set by Luke in the context of Jesus ’ dining at the home of a Pharisee . Controversies with or reprimands of Pharisees are regularly set by Luke within the context of Jesus ’ eating with Pharisees ( see Lk 5:29–39 ; 7:36–50 ; 14:1–24 ) . A different compilation of similar sayings is found in Mt

NABRE	Luke	12	16	Then he told them a parable . “ There was a rich man whose land produced a bountiful harvest .
NABRE	Luke	12	17	He asked himself , ‘ What shall I do , for I do not have space to store my harvest ? ’
NABRE	Luke	12	18	And he said , ‘ This is what I shall do : I shall tear down my barns and build larger ones . There I shall store all my grain and other goods
NABRE	Luke	12	19	( J ) and I shall say to myself , “ Now as for you , you have so many good things stored up for many years , rest , eat , drink , be merry ! ” ’ ( K )
NABRE	Luke	12	20	But God said to him , ‘ You fool , this night your life will be demanded of you ; and the things you have prepared , to whom will they belong ? ’
NABRE	Luke	12	21	Thus will it be for the one who stores up treasure for himself but is not rich in what matters to God. ” [ g ] Dependence on God .
NABRE	Luke	12	22	( L ) He said to [ his ] disciples , “ Therefore I tell you , do not worry about your life and what you will eat , or about your body and what you will wear .
NABRE	Luke	12	23	For life is more than food and the body more than clothing .
NABRE	Luke	12	24	Notice the ravens : they do not sow or reap ; they have neither storehouse nor barn , yet God feeds them . How much more important are you than birds ! ( M )
NABRE	Luke	12	25	Can any of you by worrying add a moment to your life-span ?
NABRE	Luke	12	26	If even the smallest things are beyond your control , why are you anxious about the rest ?
NABRE	Luke	12	27	Notice how the flowers grow . They do not toil or spin . But I tell you , not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of them . ( N )
NABRE	Luke	12	28	If God so clothes the grass in the field that grows today and is thrown into the oven tomorrow , will he not much more provide for you , O you of little faith ?
NABRE	Luke	12	29	As for you , do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink , and do not worry anymore .
NABRE	Luke	12	30	All the nations of the world seek for these things , and your Father knows that you need them .
NABRE	Luke	12	31	Instead , seek his kingdom , and these other things will be given you besides .
NABRE	Luke	12	32	Do not be afraid any longer , little flock , for your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom . ( O )
NABRE	Luke	12	33	Sell your belongings and give alms . Provide money bags for yourselves that do not wear out , an inexhaustible treasure in heaven that no thief can reach nor moth destroy . ( P )
NABRE	Luke	12	34	For where your treasure is , there also will your heart be . Vigilant and Faithful Servants . [ h ]
NABRE	Luke	12	35	( Q ) “ Gird your loins and light your lamps
NABRE	Luke	12	36	and be like servants who await their master ’ s return from a wedding , ready to open immediately when he comes and knocks . ( R )
NABRE	Luke	12	37	Blessed are those servants whom the master finds vigilant on his arrival . Amen , I say to you , he will gird himself , have them recline at table , and proceed to wait on them .
NABRE	Luke	12	38	And should he come in the second or third watch and find them prepared in this way , blessed are those servants .
NABRE	Luke	12	39	( S ) Be sure of this : if the master of the house had known the hour when the thief was coming , he would not have let his house be broken into .
NABRE	Luke	12	40	You also must be prepared , for at an hour you do not expect , the Son of Man will come. ”
NABRE	Luke	12	41	Then Peter said , “ Lord , is this parable meant for us or for everyone ? ”
NABRE	Luke	12	42	And the Lord replied , “ Who , then , is the faithful and prudent steward whom the master will put in charge of his servants to distribute [ the ] food allowance at the proper time ?
NABRE	Luke	12	43	Blessed is that servant whom his master on arrival finds doing so .
NABRE	Luke	12	44	Truly , I say to you , he will put him in charge of all his property .
NABRE	Luke	12	45	But if that servant says to himself , ‘ My master is delayed in coming , ’ [ i ] and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants , to eat and drink and get drunk ,
NABRE	Luke	12	46	then that servant ’ s master will come on an unexpected day and at an unknown hour and will punish him severely and assign him a place with the unfaithful .
NABRE	Luke	12	47	That servant who knew his master ’ s will but did not make preparations nor act in accord with his will shall be beaten severely ; ( T )
NABRE	Luke	12	48	and the servant who was ignorant of his master ’ s will but acted in a way deserving of a severe beating shall be beaten only lightly . Much will be required of the person entrusted with much , and still more will be demanded of the person entrusted with more . Jesus : A Cause of Division . [ j ]
NABRE	Luke	12	49	“ I have come to set the earth on fire , and how I wish it were already blazing !
NABRE	Luke	12	50	[ k ] There is a baptism with which I must be baptized , and how great is my anguish until it is accomplished ! ( U )
NABRE	Luke	12	51	Do you think that I have come to establish peace on the earth ? ( V ) No , I tell you , but rather division . ( W )
NABRE	Luke	12	52	From now on a household of five will be divided , three against two and two against three ;
NABRE	Luke	12	53	a father will be divided against his son and a son against his father , a mother against her daughter and a daughter against her mother , a mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. ” ( X ) Signs of the Times . ( Y )
NABRE	Luke	12	54	He also said to the crowds , “ When you see [ a ] cloud rising in the west you say immediately that it is going to rain—and so it does ;
NABRE	Luke	12	55	and when you notice that the wind is blowing from the south you say that it is going to be hot—and so it is .
NABRE	Luke	12	56	You hypocrites ! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky ; why do you not know how to interpret the present time ? Settlement with an Opponent . ( Z )
NABRE	Luke	12	57	“ Why do you not judge for yourselves what is right ?
NABRE	Luke	12	58	If you are to go with your opponent before a magistrate , make an effort to settle the matter on the way ; otherwise your opponent will turn you over to the judge , and the judge hand you over to the constable , and the constable throw you into prison .
NABRE	Luke	12	59	I say to you , you will not be released until you have paid the last penny. ” [ l ] Footnotes - 12:1 See notes on Mk 8:15 and Mt 16:5–12 . - 12:2–9 Luke presents a collection of sayings of Jesus exhorting his followers to acknowledge him and his mission fearlessly and assuring them of God ’ s protection even in times of persecution . They are paralleled in Mt 10:26–33 . - 12:5 Gehenna : see note on Mt 5:22 . - 12:6 Two small coins : the Roman copper coin , the assarion ( Latin as ) , was worth about one-sixteenth of a denarius ( see note on Lk 7:41 ) . - 12:10–12 The sayings about the holy Spirit are set in the context of fearlessness in the face of persecution ( Lk 12:2–9 ; cf . Mt 12:31–32 ) . The holy Spirit will be presented in Luke ’ s second volume , the Acts of the Apostles , as the power responsible for the guidance of the Christian mission and the source of courage in the face of persecution . - 12:13–34 Luke has joined together sayings contrasting those whose focus and trust in life is on material possessions , symbolized here by the rich fool of the parable ( Lk 12:16–21 ) , with those who recognize their complete dependence on God ( Lk 12:21 ) , those whose radical detachment from material possessions symbolizes their heavenly treasure ( Lk 12:33–34 ) . - 12:21 Rich in what matters to God : literally , “ rich for God. ” - 12:35–48 This collection of sayings relates to Luke ’ s understanding of the end time and the return of Jesus . Luke emphasizes for his readers the importance of being faithful to the instructions of Jesus in the period before the parousia . - 12:45 My master is delayed in coming : this statement indicates that early Christian expectations for the imminent return of Jesus had undergone some modification . Luke cautions his readers against counting on such a delay and acting irresponsibly . Cf . the similar warning in Mt 24:48 . - 12:49–53 Jesus ’ proclamation of the kingdom is a refining and purifying fire . His message that meets with acceptance or rejection will be a source of conflict and dissension even within families . - 12:50 Baptism : i.e. , his death . - 12:59 The last penny : Greek , lepton , a very small amount . Mt 5:26 has for “ the last penny ” the Greek word kodrantēs ( Latin quadrans , “ farthing ” ) .

NABRE	Luke	13	13	He laid his hands on her , and she at once stood up straight and glorified God .
NABRE	Luke	13	1	At that time some people who were present there told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate [ b ] had mingled with the blood of their sacrifices .
NABRE	Luke	13	2	He said to them in reply , “ Do you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way they were greater sinners than all other Galileans ? ( A )
NABRE	Luke	13	3	By no means ! But I tell you , if you do not repent , ( B ) you will all perish as they did !

NABRE	Luke	13	5	By no means ! But I tell you , if you do not repent , you will all perish as they did ! ” The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree . [ d ]
NABRE	Luke	13	6	( C ) And he told them this parable : “ There once was a person who had a fig tree planted in his orchard , and when he came in search of fruit on it but found none ,
NABRE	Luke	13	7	he said to the gardener , ‘ For three years now I have come in search of fruit on this fig tree but have found none . [ So ] cut it down . Why should it exhaust the soil ? ’
NABRE	Luke	13	8	He said to him in reply , ‘ Sir , leave it for this year also , and I shall cultivate the ground around it and fertilize it ;
NABRE	Luke	13	9	it may bear fruit in the future . If not you can cut it down. ’ ” Cure of a Crippled Woman on the Sabbath . [ e ]
NABRE	Luke	13	10	He was teaching in a synagogue on the sabbath .
NABRE	Luke	13	11	And a woman was there who for eighteen years had been crippled by a spirit ; she was bent over , completely incapable of standing erect .
NABRE	Luke	13	12	When Jesus saw her , he called to her and said , “ Woman , you are set free of your infirmity. ”
NABRE	Luke	13	14	( D ) But the leader of the synagogue , indignant that Jesus had cured on the sabbath , said to the crowd in reply , “ There are six days when work should be done . Come on those days to be cured , not on the sabbath day. ”
NABRE	Luke	13	15	[ f ] The Lord said to him in reply , “ Hypocrites ! Does not each one of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his ass from the manger and lead it out for watering ? ( E )
NABRE	Luke	13	16	[ g ] This daughter of Abraham , whom Satan has bound for eighteen years now , ought she not to have been set free on the sabbath day from this bondage ? ” ( F )
NABRE	Luke	13	17	When he said this , all his adversaries were humiliated ; and the whole crowd rejoiced at all the splendid deeds done by him . The Parable of the Mustard Seed . ( G )
NABRE	Luke	13	18	[ h ] Then he said , “ What is the kingdom of God like ? To what can I compare it ?
NABRE	Luke	13	19	It is like a mustard seed that a person took and planted in the garden . When it was fully grown , it became a large bush and ‘ the birds of the sky dwelt in its branches. ’ ” ( H ) The Parable of the Yeast . ( I )
NABRE	Luke	13	20	Again he said , “ To what shall I compare the kingdom of God ?
NABRE	Luke	13	21	It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed [ in ] with three measures of wheat flour until the whole batch of dough was leavened. ” The Narrow Door ; Salvation and Rejection . [ i ]
NABRE	Luke	13	22	He passed through towns and villages , teaching as he went and making his way to Jerusalem .
NABRE	Luke	13	23	Someone asked him , “ Lord , will only a few people be saved ? ” He answered them ,
NABRE	Luke	13	24	( J ) “ Strive to enter through the narrow door , for many , I tell you , will attempt to enter but will not be strong enough . ( K )
NABRE	Luke	13	25	After the master of the house has arisen and locked the door , then will you stand outside knocking and saying , ‘ Lord , open the door for us. ’ He will say to you in reply , ‘ I do not know where you are from. ’ ( L )
NABRE	Luke	13	26	And you will say , ‘ We ate and drank in your company and you taught in our streets. ’
NABRE	Luke	13	27	( M ) Then he will say to you , ‘ I do not know where [ you ] are from . Depart from me , all you evildoers ! ’
NABRE	Luke	13	28	( N ) And there will be wailing and grinding of teeth when you see Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God and you yourselves cast out .
NABRE	Luke	13	29	And people will come from the east and the west and from the north and the south and will recline at table in the kingdom of God . ( O )
NABRE	Luke	13	30	For behold , some are last who will be first , and some are first who will be last. ” ( P ) Herod ’ s Desire to Kill Jesus .
NABRE	Luke	13	31	At that time some Pharisees came to him and said , “ Go away , leave this area because Herod wants to kill you. ”
NABRE	Luke	13	32	He replied , “ Go and tell that fox , ‘ Behold , I cast out demons and I perform healings today and tomorrow , and on the third day I accomplish my purpose . [ j ]
NABRE	Luke	13	33	[ k ] Yet I must continue on my way today , ( Q ) tomorrow , and the following day , for it is impossible that a prophet should die outside of Jerusalem. ’ The Lament over Jerusalem . ( R )
NABRE	Luke	13	34	“ Jerusalem , Jerusalem , you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you , how many times I yearned to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings , but you were unwilling !
NABRE	Luke	13	35	Behold , your house will be abandoned . [ But ] I tell you , you will not see me until [ the time comes when ] you say , ‘ Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. ’ ” ( S ) Footnotes - 13:1–5 The death of the Galileans at the hands of Pilate ( Lk 13:1 ) and the accidental death of those on whom the tower fell ( Lk 13:4 ) are presented by the Lucan Jesus as timely reminders of the need for all to repent , for the victims of these tragedies should not be considered outstanding sinners who were singled out for punishment . - 13:1 The slaughter of the Galileans by Pilate is unknown outside Luke ; but from what is known about Pilate from the Jewish historian Josephus , such a slaughter would be in keeping with the character of Pilate . Josephus reports that Pilate had disrupted a religious gathering of the Samaritans on Mount Gerizim with a slaughter of the participants ( Antiquities 18:86–87 ) , and that on another occasion Pilate had killed many Jews who had opposed him when he appropriated money from the temple treasury to build an aqueduct in Jerusalem ( Jewish War 2:175–77 ; Antiquities 18:60–62 ) . - 13:4 Like the incident mentioned in Lk 13:1 nothing of this accident in Jerusalem is known outside Luke and the New Testament . - 13:6–9 Following on the call to repentance in Lk 13:1–5 , the parable of the barren fig tree presents a story about the continuing patience of God with those who have not yet given evidence of their repentance ( see Lk 3:8 ) . The parable may also be alluding to the delay of the end time , when punishment will be meted out , and the importance of preparing for the end of the age because the delay will not be permanent ( Lk 13:8–9 ) . - 13:10–17 The cure of the crippled woman on the sabbath and the controversy that results furnishes a parallel to an incident that will be reported by Luke in 14:1–6 , the cure of the man with dropsy on the sabbath . A characteristic of Luke ’ s style is the juxtaposition of an incident that reveals Jesus ’ concern for a man with an incident that reveals his concern for a woman ; cf. , e.g. , Lk 7:11–17 and Lk 8:49–56 . - 13:15–16 If the law as interpreted by Jewish tradition allowed for the untying of bound animals on the sabbath , how much more should this woman who has been bound by Satan ’ s power be freed on the sabbath from her affliction . - 13:16 Whom Satan has bound : affliction and infirmity are taken as evidence of Satan ’ s hold on humanity . The healing ministry of Jesus reveals the gradual wresting from Satan of control over humanity and the establishment of God ’ s kingdom . - 13:18–21 Two parables are used to illustrate the future proportions of the kingdom of God that will result from its deceptively small beginning in the preaching and healing ministry of Jesus . They are paralleled in Mt 13:31–33 and Mk 4:30–32 . - 13:22–30 These sayings of Jesus follow in Luke upon the parables of the kingdom ( Lk 13:18–21 ) and stress that great effort is required for entrance into the kingdom ( Lk 13:24 ) and that there is an urgency to accept the present opportunity to enter because the narrow door will not remain open indefinitely ( Lk 13:25 ) . Lying behind the sayings is the rejection of Jesus and his message by his Jewish contemporaries ( Lk 13:26 ) whose places at table in the kingdom will be taken by Gentiles from the four corners of the world ( Lk 13:29 ) . Those called last ( the Gentiles ) will precede those to whom the invitation to enter was first extended ( the Jews ) . See also Lk 14:15–24 . - 13:32 Nothing , not even Herod ’ s desire to kill Jesus , stands in the way of Jesus ’ role in fulfilling God ’ s will and in establishing the kingdom through his exorcisms and healings . - 13:33 It is impossible that a prophet should die outside of Jerusalem : Jerusalem is the city of destiny and the goal of the journey of the prophet Jesus . Only when he reaches the holy city will his work be accomplished .

NABRE	Luke	14	14	blessed indeed will you be because of their inability to repay you . For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous. ” ( J ) The Parable of the Great Feast . [ e ]
NABRE	Luke	14	1	( A ) On a sabbath he went to dine at the home of one of the leading Pharisees , and the people there were observing him carefully . ( B )
NABRE	Luke	14	2	In front of him there was a man suffering from dropsy . [ b ]
NABRE	Luke	14	3	Jesus spoke to the scholars of the law and Pharisees in reply , asking , “ Is it lawful to cure on the sabbath or not ? ” ( C )
NABRE	Luke	14	4	But they kept silent ; so he took the man and , after he had healed him , dismissed him .
NABRE	Luke	14	5	Then he said to them , “ Who among you , if your son or ox [ c ] falls into a cistern , would not immediately pull him out on the sabbath day ? ” ( D )
NABRE	Luke	14	6	But they were unable to answer his question . ( E ) Conduct of Invited Guests and Hosts . [ d ]
NABRE	Luke	14	7	( F ) He told a parable to those who had been invited , noticing how they were choosing the places of honor at the table .
NABRE	Luke	14	8	( G ) “ When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet , do not recline at table in the place of honor . A more distinguished guest than you may have been invited by him ,
NABRE	Luke	14	9	and the host who invited both of you may approach you and say , ‘ Give your place to this man , ’ and then you would proceed with embarrassment to take the lowest place .
NABRE	Luke	14	10	Rather , when you are invited , go and take the lowest place so that when the host comes to you he may say , ‘ My friend , move up to a higher position. ’ Then you will enjoy the esteem of your companions at the table .
NABRE	Luke	14	11	For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , but the one who humbles himself will be exalted. ” ( H )
NABRE	Luke	14	12	Then he said to the host who invited him , “ When you hold a lunch or a dinner , do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your wealthy neighbors , in case they may invite you back and you have repayment . ( I )
NABRE	Luke	14	13	Rather , when you hold a banquet , invite the poor , the crippled , the lame , the blind ;
NABRE	Luke	14	15	One of his fellow guests on hearing this said to him , “ Blessed is the one who will dine in the kingdom of God. ”
NABRE	Luke	14	16	( K ) He replied to him , “ A man gave a great dinner to which he invited many .
NABRE	Luke	14	17	When the time for the dinner came , he dispatched his servant to say to those invited , ‘ Come , everything is now ready. ’
NABRE	Luke	14	18	But one by one , they all began to excuse themselves . The first said to him , ‘ I have purchased a field and must go to examine it ; I ask you , consider me excused. ’
NABRE	Luke	14	19	And another said , ‘ I have purchased five yoke of oxen and am on my way to evaluate them ; I ask you , consider me excused. ’
NABRE	Luke	14	20	And another said , ‘ I have just married a woman , and therefore I can not come. ’
NABRE	Luke	14	21	The servant went and reported this to his master . Then the master of the house in a rage commanded his servant , ‘ Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in here the poor and the crippled , the blind and the lame. ’
NABRE	Luke	14	22	The servant reported , ‘ Sir , your orders have been carried out and still there is room. ’
NABRE	Luke	14	23	The master then ordered the servant , ‘ Go out to the highways and hedgerows and make people come in that my home may be filled .
NABRE	Luke	14	24	For , I tell you , none of those men who were invited will taste my dinner. ’ ” Sayings on Discipleship . [ f ]
NABRE	Luke	14	25	Great crowds were traveling with him , and he turned and addressed them ,
NABRE	Luke	14	26	( L ) “ If any one comes to me without hating his father [ g ] and mother , wife and children , brothers and sisters , and even his own life , he can not be my disciple . ( M )
NABRE	Luke	14	27	Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after me can not be my disciple . ( N )
NABRE	Luke	14	28	Which of you wishing to construct a tower does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if there is enough for its completion ?
NABRE	Luke	14	29	Otherwise , after laying the foundation and finding himself unable to finish the work the onlookers should laugh at him
NABRE	Luke	14	30	and say , ‘ This one began to build but did not have the resources to finish. ’
NABRE	Luke	14	31	Or what king marching into battle would not first sit down and decide whether with ten thousand troops he can successfully oppose another king advancing upon him with twenty thousand troops ?
NABRE	Luke	14	32	But if not , while he is still far away , he will send a delegation to ask for peace terms .
NABRE	Luke	14	33	In the same way , everyone of you who does not renounce all his possessions can not be my disciple . ( O ) The Simile of Salt . [ h ]
NABRE	Luke	14	34	“ Salt is good , but if salt itself loses its taste , with what can its flavor be restored ? ( P )
NABRE	Luke	14	35	It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile ; it is thrown out . Whoever has ears to hear ought to hear. ” ( Q ) Footnotes - 14:1–6 See note on Lk 13:10–17 . - 14:2 Dropsy : an abnormal swelling of the body because of the retention and accumulation of fluid . - 14:5 Your son or ox : this is the reading of many of the oldest and most important New Testament manuscripts . Because of the strange collocation of son and ox , some copyists have altered it to “ your ass or ox , ” on the model of the saying in Lk 13:15 . - 14:7–14 The banquet scene found only in Luke provides the opportunity for these teachings of Jesus on humility and presents a setting to display Luke ’ s interest in Jesus ’ attitude toward the rich and the poor ( see notes on Lk 4:18 ; 6:20–26 ; 12:13–34 ) . - 14:15–24 The parable of the great dinner is a further illustration of the rejection by Israel , God ’ s chosen people , of Jesus ’ invitation to share in the banquet in the kingdom and the extension of the invitation to other Jews whose identification as the poor , crippled , blind , and lame ( Lk 14:21 ) classifies them among those who recognize their need for salvation , and to Gentiles ( Lk 14:23 ) . A similar parable is found in Mt 22:1–10 . - 14:25–33 This collection of sayings , most of which are peculiar to Luke , focuses on the total dedication necessary for the disciple of Jesus . No attachment to family ( Lk 14:26 ) or possessions ( Lk 14:33 ) can stand in the way of the total commitment demanded of the disciple . Also , acceptance of the call to be a disciple demands readiness to accept persecution and suffering ( Lk 14:27 ) and a realistic assessment of the hardships and costs ( Lk 14:28–32 ) . - 14:26 Hating his father… : cf . the similar saying in Mt 10:37 . The disciple ’ s family must take second place to the absolute dedication involved in following Jesus ( see also Lk 9:59–62 ) . - 14:34–35 The simile of salt follows the sayings of Jesus that demanded of the disciple total dedication and detachment from family and possessions and illustrates the condition of one who does not display this total commitment . The halfhearted disciple is like salt that can not serve its intended purpose . See the simile of salt in Mt 5:13 and the note there .

NABRE	Luke	15	15	So he hired himself out to one of the local citizens who sent him to his farm to tend the swine .
NABRE	Luke	15	1	[ a ] The tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to listen to him ,
NABRE	Luke	15	2	but the Pharisees and scribes began to complain , saying , “ This man welcomes sinners and eats with them. ” ( B )
NABRE	Luke	15	3	So to them he addressed this parable .
NABRE	Luke	15	4	( C ) “ What man among you having a hundred sheep and losing one of them would not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after the lost one ( D ) until he finds it ? ( E )
NABRE	Luke	15	5	And when he does find it , he sets it on his shoulders with great joy
NABRE	Luke	15	6	and , upon his arrival home , he calls together his friends and neighbors and says to them , ‘ Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep. ’
NABRE	Luke	15	7	I tell you , in just the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance . ( F ) The Parable of the Lost Coin .
NABRE	Luke	15	8	“ Or what woman having ten coins [ b ] and losing one would not light a lamp and sweep the house , searching carefully until she finds it ?
NABRE	Luke	15	9	And when she does find it , she calls together her friends and neighbors and says to them , ‘ Rejoice with me because I have found the coin that I lost. ’
NABRE	Luke	15	10	In just the same way , I tell you , there will be rejoicing among the angels of God over one sinner who repents. ” The Parable of the Lost Son .
NABRE	Luke	15	11	Then he said , “ A man had two sons ,
NABRE	Luke	15	12	and the younger son said to his father , ‘ Father , give me the share of your estate that should come to me. ’ So the father divided the property between them .
NABRE	Luke	15	13	After a few days , the younger son collected all his belongings and set off to a distant country where he squandered his inheritance on a life of dissipation . ( G )
NABRE	Luke	15	14	When he had freely spent everything , a severe famine struck that country , and he found himself in dire need .
NABRE	Luke	15	16	And he longed to eat his fill of the pods on which the swine fed , but nobody gave him any .
NABRE	Luke	15	17	Coming to his senses he thought , ‘ How many of my father ’ s hired workers have more than enough food to eat , but here am I , dying from hunger .
NABRE	Luke	15	18	I shall get up and go to my father and I shall say to him , “ Father , I have sinned against heaven and against you .
NABRE	Luke	15	19	I no longer deserve to be called your son ; treat me as you would treat one of your hired workers. ” ’
NABRE	Luke	15	20	So he got up and went back to his father . While he was still a long way off , his father caught sight of him , and was filled with compassion . He ran to his son , embraced him and kissed him .
NABRE	Luke	15	21	His son said to him , ‘ Father , I have sinned against heaven and against you ; I no longer deserve to be called your son. ’
NABRE	Luke	15	22	But his father ordered his servants , ‘ Quickly bring the finest robe and put it on him ; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet .
NABRE	Luke	15	23	Take the fattened calf and slaughter it . Then let us celebrate with a feast ,
NABRE	Luke	15	24	because this son of mine was dead , and has come to life again ; he was lost , and has been found. ’ Then the celebration began .
NABRE	Luke	15	25	Now the older son had been out in the field and , on his way back , as he neared the house , he heard the sound of music and dancing .
NABRE	Luke	15	26	He called one of the servants and asked what this might mean .
NABRE	Luke	15	27	The servant said to him , ‘ Your brother has returned and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound. ’
NABRE	Luke	15	28	He became angry , and when he refused to enter the house , his father came out and pleaded with him .
NABRE	Luke	15	29	He said to his father in reply , ‘ Look , all these years I served you and not once did I disobey your orders ; yet you never gave me even a young goat to feast on with my friends .
NABRE	Luke	15	30	But when your son returns who swallowed up your property with prostitutes , for him you slaughter the fattened calf. ’
NABRE	Luke	15	31	He said to him , ‘ My son , you are here with me always ; everything I have is yours .
NABRE	Luke	15	32	But now we must celebrate and rejoice , because your brother was dead and has come to life again ; he was lost and has been found. ’ ” Footnotes - 15:1–32 To the parable of the lost sheep ( Lk 15:1–7 ) that Luke shares with Matthew ( Mt 18:12–14 ) , Luke adds two parables ( the lost coin , Lk 15:8–10 ; the prodigal son , Lk 15:11–32 ) from his own special tradition to illustrate Jesus ’ particular concern for the lost and God ’ s love for the repentant sinner . - 15:8 Ten coins : literally , “ ten drachmas. ” A drachma was a Greek silver coin .

With John , the fulfillment of the Old Testament promises has begun . - 16:19–31 The parable of the rich man and Lazarus again illustrates Luke ’ s concern with Jesus ’ attitude toward the rich and the poor . The reversal of the fates of the rich man and Lazarus ( Lk 16:22–23 ) illustrates the teachings of Jesus in Luke ’ s “ Sermon on the Plain ” ( Lk 6:20–21 , 24–25 ) . - 16:19 The oldest Greek manuscript of Luke dating from ca . A.D. 175–225 records the name of the rich man as an abbreviated form of “ Nineveh , ” but there is very little textual support in other manuscripts for this reading . “ Dives ” of popular tradition is the Latin Vulgate ’ s translation for “ rich man ” ( Lk 16:19–31 ) . - 16:23 The netherworld : see note on Lk 10:15 . - 16:30–31 A foreshadowing in Luke ’ s gospel of the rejection of the call to repentance even after Jesus ’ resurrection .

NABRE	Luke	16	1	Then he also said to his disciples , “ A rich man had a steward who was reported to him for squandering his property .
NABRE	Luke	16	2	He summoned him and said , ‘ What is this I hear about you ? Prepare a full account of your stewardship , because you can no longer be my steward. ’
NABRE	Luke	16	3	The steward said to himself , ‘ What shall I do , now that my master is taking the position of steward away from me ? I am not strong enough to dig and I am ashamed to beg .
NABRE	Luke	16	4	I know what I shall do so that , when I am removed from the stewardship , they may welcome me into their homes. ’
NABRE	Luke	16	5	He called in his master ’ s debtors one by one . To the first he said , ‘ How much do you owe my master ? ’
NABRE	Luke	16	6	[ b ] He replied , ‘ One hundred measures of olive oil. ’ He said to him , ‘ Here is your promissory note . Sit down and quickly write one for fifty. ’
NABRE	Luke	16	7	Then to another he said , ‘ And you , how much do you owe ? ’ He replied , ‘ One hundred kors [ c ] of wheat. ’ He said to him , ‘ Here is your promissory note ; write one for eighty. ’
NABRE	Luke	16	8	And the master commended that dishonest steward for acting prudently . Application of the Parable . [ d ] “ For the children of this world are more prudent in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light . [ e ] ( A )
NABRE	Luke	16	9	I tell you , make friends for yourselves with dishonest wealth , [ f ] so that when it fails , you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings . ( B )
NABRE	Luke	16	10	[ g ] The person who is trustworthy in very small matters is also trustworthy in great ones ; and the person who is dishonest in very small matters is also dishonest in great ones . ( C )
NABRE	Luke	16	11	If , therefore , you are not trustworthy with dishonest wealth , who will trust you with true wealth ?
NABRE	Luke	16	12	If you are not trustworthy with what belongs to another , who will give you what is yours ?
NABRE	Luke	16	13	No servant can serve two masters . [ h ] He will either hate one and love the other , or be devoted to one and despise the other . You can not serve God and mammon. ” ( D ) A Saying Against the Pharisees .
NABRE	Luke	16	14	[ i ] The Pharisees , who loved money , [ j ] heard all these things and sneered at him .
NABRE	Luke	16	15	And he said to them , “ You justify yourselves in the sight of others , but God knows your hearts ; for what is of human esteem is an abomination in the sight of God . ( E ) Sayings About the Law .
NABRE	Luke	16	17	It is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for the smallest part of a letter of the law to become invalid . ( G ) Sayings About Divorce .
NABRE	Luke	16	18	“ Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery , and the one who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery . ( H ) The Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus . [ l ]
NABRE	Luke	16	19	“ There was a rich man [ m ] who dressed in purple garments and fine linen and dined sumptuously each day .
NABRE	Luke	16	20	And lying at his door was a poor man named Lazarus , covered with sores , ( I )
NABRE	Luke	16	21	who would gladly have eaten his fill of the scraps that fell from the rich man ’ s table . Dogs even used to come and lick his sores .
NABRE	Luke	16	22	When the poor man died , he was carried away by angels to the bosom of Abraham . The rich man also died and was buried ,
NABRE	Luke	16	23	and from the netherworld , [ n ] where he was in torment , he raised his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side .
NABRE	Luke	16	24	And he cried out , ‘ Father Abraham , have pity on me . Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue , for I am suffering torment in these flames. ’
NABRE	Luke	16	25	Abraham replied , ‘ My child , remember that you received what was good during your lifetime while Lazarus likewise received what was bad ; but now he is comforted here , whereas you are tormented . ( J )
NABRE	Luke	16	26	Moreover , between us and you a great chasm is established to prevent anyone from crossing who might wish to go from our side to yours or from your side to ours. ’
NABRE	Luke	16	27	He said , ‘ Then I beg you , father , send him to my father ’ s house ,
NABRE	Luke	16	28	for I have five brothers , so that he may warn them , lest they too come to this place of torment. ’
NABRE	Luke	16	29	But Abraham replied , ‘ They have Moses and the prophets . Let them listen to them. ’
NABRE	Luke	16	30	[ o ] He said , ‘ Oh no , father Abraham , but if someone from the dead goes to them , they will repent. ’
NABRE	Luke	16	31	Then Abraham said , ‘ If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded if someone should rise from the dead. ’ ” ( K ) Footnotes - 16:1–8a The parable of the dishonest steward has to be understood in the light of the Palestinian custom of agents acting on behalf of their masters and the usurious practices common to such agents . The dishonesty of the steward consisted in the squandering of his master ’ s property ( Lk 16:1 ) and not in any subsequent graft . The master commends the dishonest steward who has forgone his own usurious commission on the business transaction by having the debtors write new notes that reflected only the real amount owed the master ( i.e. , minus the steward ’ s profit ) . The dishonest steward acts in this way in order to ingratiate himself with the debtors because he knows he is being dismissed from his position ( Lk 16:3 ) . The parable , then , teaches the prudent use of one ’ s material goods in light of an imminent crisis . - 16:6 One hundred measures : literally , “ one hundred baths. ” A bath is a Hebrew unit of liquid measurement equivalent to eight or nine gallons . - 16:7 One hundred kors : a kor is a Hebrew unit of dry measure for grain or wheat equivalent to ten or twelve bushels . - 16:8b–13 Several originally independent sayings of Jesus are gathered here by Luke to form the concluding application of the parable of the dishonest steward . - 16:8b–9 The first conclusion recommends the prudent use of one ’ s wealth ( in the light of the coming of the end of the age ) after the manner of the children of this world , represented in the parable by the dishonest steward . - 16:9 Dishonest wealth : literally , “ mammon of iniquity. ” Mammon is the Greek transliteration of a Hebrew or Aramaic word that is usually explained as meaning “ that in which one trusts. ” The characterization of this wealth as dishonest expresses a tendency of wealth to lead one to dishonesty . Eternal dwellings : or , “ eternal tents , ” i.e. , heaven . - 16:10–12 The second conclusion recommends constant fidelity to those in positions of responsibility . - 16:13 The third conclusion is a general statement about the incompatibility of serving God and being a slave to riches . To be dependent upon wealth is opposed to the teachings of Jesus who counseled complete dependence on the Father as one of the characteristics of the Christian disciple ( Lk 12:22–39 ) . God and mammon : see note on Lk 16:9 . Mammon is used here as if it were itself a god . - 16:14–18 The two parables about the use of riches in chap .

NABRE	Luke	17	17	Jesus said in reply , “ Ten were cleansed , were they not ? Where are the other nine ?
NABRE	Luke	17	1	( A ) He said to his disciples , “ Things that cause sin will inevitably occur , but woe to the person through whom they occur .
NABRE	Luke	17	2	It would be better for him if a millstone were put around his neck and he be thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin .

NABRE	Luke	17	7	“ Who among you would say to your servant who has just come in from plowing or tending sheep in the field , ‘ Come here immediately and take your place at table ’ ?
NABRE	Luke	17	8	Would he not rather say to him , ‘ Prepare something for me to eat . Put on your apron and wait on me while I eat and drink . You may eat and drink when I am finished ’ ?
NABRE	Luke	17	9	Is he grateful to that servant because he did what was commanded ?
NABRE	Luke	17	10	So should it be with you . When you have done all you have been commanded , say , ‘ We are unprofitable servants ; we have done what we were obliged to do. ’ ” The Cleansing of Ten Lepers . [ c ]

NABRE	Luke	17	12	As he was entering a village , ten lepers met [ him ] . They stood at a distance from him
NABRE	Luke	17	13	and raised their voice , saying , “ Jesus , Master ! Have pity on us ! ” ( F )
NABRE	Luke	17	14	And when he saw them , he said , “ Go show yourselves to the priests. ” [ e ] As they were going they were cleansed . ( G )
NABRE	Luke	17	15	And one of them , realizing he had been healed , returned , glorifying God in a loud voice ;
NABRE	Luke	17	16	and he fell at the feet of Jesus and thanked him . He was a Samaritan .
NABRE	Luke	17	18	Has none but this foreigner returned to give thanks to God ? ”
NABRE	Luke	17	19	Then he said to him , “ Stand up and go ; your faith has saved you. ” ( H ) The Coming of the Kingdom of God .
NABRE	Luke	17	20	[ f ] Asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come , he said in reply , “ The coming of the kingdom of God can not be observed , ( I )
NABRE	Luke	17	21	[ g ] and no one will announce , ‘ Look , here it is , ’ or , ‘ There it is. ’ ( J ) For behold , the kingdom of God is among you. ” The Day of the Son of Man .
NABRE	Luke	17	22	Then he said to his disciples , “ The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man , but you will not see it .
NABRE	Luke	17	23	There will be those who will say to you , ‘ Look , there he is , ’ [ or ] ‘ Look , here he is. ’ Do not go off , do not run in pursuit . ( K )
NABRE	Luke	17	24	For just as lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other , so will the Son of Man be [ in his day ] . ( L )
NABRE	Luke	17	25	But first he must suffer greatly and be rejected by this generation . ( M )
NABRE	Luke	17	26	As it was in the days of Noah , ( N ) so it will be in the days of the Son of Man ;
NABRE	Luke	17	27	they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage up to the day that Noah entered the ark , and the flood came and destroyed them all .
NABRE	Luke	17	28	( O ) Similarly , as it was in the days of Lot : they were eating , drinking , buying , selling , planting , building ;
NABRE	Luke	17	29	on the day when Lot left Sodom , fire and brimstone rained from the sky to destroy them all .
NABRE	Luke	17	30	So it will be on the day the Son of Man is revealed .
NABRE	Luke	17	31	( P ) On that day , a person who is on the housetop and whose belongings are in the house must not go down to get them , and likewise a person in the field must not return to what was left behind . ( Q )
NABRE	Luke	17	32	Remember the wife of Lot .
NABRE	Luke	17	33	Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it , but whoever loses it will save it . ( R )
NABRE	Luke	17	34	I tell you , on that night there will be two people in one bed ; one will be taken , the other left .
NABRE	Luke	17	35	( S ) And there will be two women grinding meal together ; one will be taken , the other left. ” [
NABRE	Luke	17	36	] [ h ]
NABRE	Luke	17	37	They said to him in reply , “ Where , Lord ? ” He said to them , “ Where the body is , there also the vultures will gather. ” ( T ) Footnotes - 17:3 Be on your guard : the translation takes Lk 17:3a as the conclusion to the saying on scandal in Lk 17:1–2 . It is not impossible that it should be taken as the beginning of the saying on forgiveness in Lk 17:3b–4 . - 17:7–10 These sayings of Jesus , peculiar to Luke , which continue his response to the apostles ’ request to increase their faith ( Lk 17:5–6 ) , remind them that Christian disciples can make no claim on God ’ s graciousness ; in fulfilling the exacting demands of discipleship , they are only doing their duty . - 17:11–19 This incident recounting the thankfulness of the cleansed Samaritan leper is narrated only in Luke ’ s gospel and provides an instance of Jesus holding up a non-Jew ( Lk 17:18 ) as an example to his Jewish contemporaries ( cf . Lk 10:33 where a similar purpose is achieved in the story of the good Samaritan ) . Moreover , it is the faith in Jesus manifested by the foreigner that has brought him salvation ( Lk 17:19 ; cf . the similar relationship between faith and salvation in Lk 7:50 ; 8:48 ,
NABRE	Luke	17	50	) . - 17:11 Through Samaria and Galilee : or , “ between Samaria and Galilee. ” - 17:14 See note on Lk 5:14 . - 17:20–37 To the question of the Pharisees about the time of the coming of God ’ s kingdom , Jesus replies that the kingdom is among you ( Lk 17:20–21 ) . The emphasis has thus been shifted from an imminent observable coming of the kingdom to something that is already present in Jesus ’ preaching and healing ministry . Luke has also appended further traditional sayings of Jesus about the unpredictable suddenness of the day of the Son of Man , and assures his readers that in spite of the delay of that day ( Lk 12:45 ) , it will bring judgment unexpectedly on those who do not continue to be vigilant . - 17:21 Among you : the Greek preposition translated as among can also be translated as “ within. ” In the light of other statements in Luke ’ s gospel about the presence of the kingdom ( see Lk 10:9 ,

NABRE	Luke	18	18	( I ) An official asked him this question , “ Good teacher , what must I do to inherit eternal life ? ” ( J )
NABRE	Luke	18	1	[ a ] Then he told them a parable about the necessity for them to pray always without becoming weary . ( A ) He said ,
NABRE	Luke	18	2	“ There was a judge in a certain town who neither feared God nor respected any human being .
NABRE	Luke	18	3	And a widow in that town used to come to him and say , ‘ Render a just decision for me against my adversary. ’
NABRE	Luke	18	4	For a long time the judge was unwilling , but eventually he thought , ‘ While it is true that I neither fear God nor respect any human being ,
NABRE	Luke	18	5	[ b ] ( B ) because this widow keeps bothering me I shall deliver a just decision for her lest she finally come and strike me. ’ ”
NABRE	Luke	18	6	The Lord said , “ Pay attention to what the dishonest judge says .
NABRE	Luke	18	7	Will not God then secure the rights of his chosen ones who call out to him day and night ? Will he be slow to answer them ?
NABRE	Luke	18	8	I tell you , he will see to it that justice is done for them speedily . But when the Son of Man comes , will he find faith on earth ? ” The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector .
NABRE	Luke	18	9	He then addressed this parable to those who were convinced of their own righteousness and despised everyone else . ( C )
NABRE	Luke	18	10	“ Two people went up to the temple area to pray ; one was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector .
NABRE	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee took up his position and spoke this prayer to himself , ‘ O God , I thank you that I am not like the rest of humanity—greedy , dishonest , adulterous—or even like this tax collector .
NABRE	Luke	18	12	I fast twice a week , and I pay tithes on my whole income. ’ ( D )
NABRE	Luke	18	13	But the tax collector stood off at a distance and would not even raise his eyes to heaven but beat his breast and prayed , ‘ O God , be merciful to me a sinner. ’ ( E )
NABRE	Luke	18	14	I tell you , the latter went home justified , not the former ; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled , and the one who humbles himself will be exalted. ” ( F ) Saying on Children and the Kingdom .
NABRE	Luke	18	15	[ c ] People were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them , [ d ] and when the disciples saw this , they rebuked them . ( G )
NABRE	Luke	18	16	Jesus , however , called the children to himself and said , “ Let the children come to me and do not prevent them ; for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
NABRE	Luke	18	17	Amen , I say to you , whoever does not accept the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it. ” ( H ) The Rich Official .
NABRE	Luke	18	19	Jesus answered him , “ Why do you call me good ? No one is good but God alone .
NABRE	Luke	18	20	You know the commandments , ‘ You shall not commit adultery ; you shall not kill ; you shall not steal ; you shall not bear false witness ; honor your father and your mother. ’ ” ( K )
NABRE	Luke	18	21	And he replied , “ All of these I have observed from my youth. ”
NABRE	Luke	18	22	[ e ] ( L ) When Jesus heard this he said to him , “ There is still one thing left for you : sell all that you have and distribute it to the poor , and you will have a treasure in heaven . Then come , follow me. ”
NABRE	Luke	18	23	But when he heard this he became quite sad , for he was very rich . On Riches and Renunciation .
NABRE	Luke	18	24	Jesus looked at him [ now sad ] and said , “ How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God !
NABRE	Luke	18	25	For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. ”
NABRE	Luke	18	26	Those who heard this said , “ Then who can be saved ? ”
NABRE	Luke	18	27	,
NABRE	Luke	18	28	Then Peter said , “ We have given up our possessions and followed you. ”
NABRE	Luke	18	29	( N ) He said to them , “ Amen , I say to you , there is no one who has given up house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
NABRE	Luke	18	30	who will not receive [ back ] an overabundant return in this present age and eternal life in the age to come. ” The Third Prediction of the Passion . ( O )
NABRE	Luke	18	31	[ f ] Then he took the Twelve aside and said to them , “ Behold , we are going up to Jerusalem and everything written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled . [ g ]
NABRE	Luke	18	32	( P ) He will be handed over to the Gentiles and he will be mocked and insulted and spat upon ;
NABRE	Luke	18	33	and after they have scourged him they will kill him , but on the third day he will rise. ”
NABRE	Luke	18	34	But they understood nothing of this ; the word remained hidden from them and they failed to comprehend what he said . ( Q ) The Healing of the Blind Beggar . ( R )
NABRE	Luke	18	35	Now as he approached Jericho a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging ,
NABRE	Luke	18	36	and hearing a crowd going by , he inquired what was happening .
NABRE	Luke	18	37	They told him , “ Jesus of Nazareth is passing by. ”
NABRE	Luke	18	38	( S ) He shouted , “ Jesus , Son of David , [ h ] have pity on me ! ”
NABRE	Luke	18	39	The people walking in front rebuked him , telling him to be silent , but he kept calling out all the more , “ Son of David , have pity on me ! ”
NABRE	Luke	18	40	Then Jesus stopped and ordered that he be brought to him ; and when he came near , Jesus asked him ,
NABRE	Luke	18	41	“ What do you want me to do for you ? ” He replied , “ Lord , please let me see. ” ( T )
NABRE	Luke	18	42	Jesus told him , “ Have sight ; your faith has saved you. ” ( U )
NABRE	Luke	18	43	He immediately received his sight and followed him , giving glory to God . When they saw this , all the people gave praise to God . Footnotes - 18:1–14 The particularly Lucan material in the travel narrative concludes with two parables on prayer . The first ( Lk 18:1–8 ) teaches the disciples the need of persistent prayer so that they not fall victims to apostasy ( Lk 18:8 ) . The second ( Lk 18:9–14 ) condemns the self-righteous , critical attitude of the Pharisee and teaches that the fundamental attitude of the Christian disciple must be the recognition of sinfulness and complete dependence on God ’ s graciousness . The second parable recalls the story of the pardoning of the sinful woman ( Lk 7:36–50 ) where a similar contrast is presented between the critical attitude of the Pharisee Simon and the love shown by the pardoned sinner . - 18:5 Strike me : the Greek verb translated as strike means “ to strike under the eye ” and suggests the extreme situation to which the persistence of the widow might lead . It may , however , be used here in the much weaker sense of “ to wear one out. ” - 18:15–19:27 Luke here includes much of the material about the journey to Jerusalem found in his Marcan source ( Lk 10:1–52 ) and adds to it the story of Zacchaeus ( Lk 19:1–10 ) from his own particular tradition and the parable of the gold coins ( minas ) ( Lk 19:11–27 ) from Q , the source common to Luke and Matthew . - 18:15–17 The sayings on children furnish a contrast to the attitude of the Pharisee in the preceding episode ( Lk 18:9–14 ) and that of the wealthy official in the following one ( Lk 18:18–23 ) who think that they can lay claim to God ’ s favor by their own merit . The attitude of the disciple should be marked by the receptivity and trustful dependence characteristic of the child . - 18:22 Detachment from material possessions results in the total dependence on God demanded of one who would inherit eternal life . Sell all that you have : the original saying ( cf . Mk 10:21 ) has characteristically been made more demanding by Luke ’ s addition of “ all. ” - 18:31–33 The details included in this third announcement of Jesus ’ suffering and death suggest that the literary formulation of the announcement has been directed by the knowledge of the historical passion and death of Jesus . - 18:31 Everything written by the prophets…will be fulfilled : this is a Lucan addition to the words of Jesus found in the Marcan source ( Mk 10:32–34 ) . Luke understands the events of Jesus ’ last days in Jerusalem to be the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy , but , as is usually the case in Luke-Acts , the author does not specify which Old Testament prophets he has in mind ; cf . Lk 24:25 ,

NABRE	Luke	19	19	And to this servant too he said , ‘ You , take charge of five cities. ’
NABRE	Luke	19	1	) a parable about the conduct of faithful and productive servants ( Lk 19:13 , 15b–26 ) and (
NABRE	Luke	19	2	) a parable about a rejected king ( Lk 19:12 , 14–15a ,
NABRE	Luke	19	3	was seeking to see who Jesus was ; but he could not see him because of the crowd , for he was short in stature .
NABRE	Luke	19	4	So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree in order to see Jesus , who was about to pass that way .
NABRE	Luke	19	5	When he reached the place , Jesus looked up and said to him , “ Zacchaeus , come down quickly , for today I must stay at your house. ”
NABRE	Luke	19	6	And he came down quickly and received him with joy .
NABRE	Luke	19	7	When they all saw this , they began to grumble , saying , “ He has gone to stay at the house of a sinner. ” ( A )
NABRE	Luke	19	8	But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord , “ Behold , half of my possessions , Lord , I shall give to the poor , and if I have extorted anything from anyone I shall repay it four times over. ” ( B )
NABRE	Luke	19	9	[ b ] And Jesus said to him , “ Today salvation ( C ) has come to this house because this man too is a descendant of Abraham .
NABRE	Luke	19	10	[ c ] ( D ) For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save what was lost. ” The Parable of the Ten Gold Coins . [ d ]
NABRE	Luke	19	11	( E ) While they were listening to him speak , he proceeded to tell a parable because he was near Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God would appear there immediately .
NABRE	Luke	19	12	So he said , “ A nobleman went off to a distant country to obtain the kingship for himself and then to return . ( F )
NABRE	Luke	19	13	He called ten of his servants and gave them ten gold coins [ e ] and told them , ‘ Engage in trade with these until I return. ’
NABRE	Luke	19	14	His fellow citizens , however , despised him and sent a delegation after him to announce , ‘ We do not want this man to be our king. ’
NABRE	Luke	19	15	But when he returned after obtaining the kingship , he had the servants called , to whom he had given the money , to learn what they had gained by trading .
NABRE	Luke	19	16	The first came forward and said , ‘ Sir , your gold coin has earned ten additional ones. ’
NABRE	Luke	19	17	He replied , ‘ Well done , good servant ! You have been faithful in this very small matter ; take charge of ten cities. ’ ( G )
NABRE	Luke	19	18	Then the second came and reported , ‘ Your gold coin , sir , has earned five more. ’
NABRE	Luke	19	20	Then the other servant came and said , ‘ Sir , here is your gold coin ; I kept it stored away in a handkerchief ,
NABRE	Luke	19	21	for I was afraid of you , because you are a demanding person ; you take up what you did not lay down and you harvest what you did not plant. ’
NABRE	Luke	19	22	He said to him , ‘ With your own words I shall condemn you , you wicked servant . You knew I was a demanding person , taking up what I did not lay down and harvesting what I did not plant ;
NABRE	Luke	19	23	why did you not put my money in a bank ? Then on my return I would have collected it with interest. ’
NABRE	Luke	19	24	And to those standing by he said , ‘ Take the gold coin from him and give it to the servant who has ten. ’
NABRE	Luke	19	25	But they said to him , ‘ Sir , he has ten gold coins. ’
NABRE	Luke	19	26	‘ I tell you , to everyone who has , more will be given , but from the one who has not , even what he has will be taken away . ( H )
NABRE	Luke	19	27	) . The story about the conduct of servants occurs in another form in Mt 25:14–20 . The story about the rejected king may have originated with a contemporary historical event . After the death of Herod the Great , his son Archelaus traveled to Rome to receive the title of king . A delegation of Jews appeared in Rome before Caesar Augustus to oppose the request of Archelaus . Although not given the title of king , Archelaus was made ruler over Judea and Samaria . As the story is used by Luke , however , it furnishes a correction to the expectation of the imminent end of the age and of the establishment of the kingdom in Jerusalem ( Lk 19:11 ) . Jesus is not on his way to Jerusalem to receive the kingly power ; for that , he must go away and only after returning from the distant country ( a reference to the parousia ) will reward and judgment take place . - 19:13 Ten gold coins : literally , “ ten minas. ” A mina was a monetary unit that in ancient Greece was the equivalent of one hundred drachmas . - 19:28–21:38 With the royal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem , a new section of Luke ’ s gospel begins , the ministry of Jesus in Jerusalem before his death and resurrection . Luke suggests that this was a lengthy ministry in Jerusalem ( Lk 19:47 ; 20:1 ; 21:37–38 ; 22:53 ) and it is characterized by Jesus ’ daily teaching in the temple ( Lk 21:37–38 ) . For the story of the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem , see also Mt 21:1–11 ; Mk 11:1–10 ; Jn 12:12–19 and the notes there . - 19:38 Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord : only in Luke is Jesus explicitly given the title king when he enters Jerusalem in triumph . Luke has inserted this title into the words of Ps 118:26 that heralded the arrival of the pilgrims coming to the holy city and to the temple . Jesus is thereby acclaimed as king ( see Lk 1:32 ) and as the one who comes ( see Mal 3:1 ; Lk 7:19 ) . Peace in heaven… : the acclamation of the disciples of Jesus in Luke echoes the announcement of the angels at the birth of Jesus ( Lk 2:14 ) . The peace Jesus brings is associated with the salvation to be accomplished here in Jerusalem . - 19:39 Rebuke your disciples : this command , found only in Luke , was given so that the Roman authorities would not interpret the acclamation of Jesus as king as an uprising against them ; cf . Lk 23:2–3 . - 19:41–44 The lament for Jerusalem is found only in Luke . By not accepting Jesus ( the one who mediates peace ) , Jerusalem will not find peace but will become the victim of devastation . - 19:43–44 Luke may be describing the actual disaster that befell Jerusalem in A.D.
NABRE	Luke	19	28	After he had said this , he proceeded on his journey up to Jerusalem .
NABRE	Luke	19	29	As he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany at the place called the Mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples . ( J )
NABRE	Luke	19	30	He said , “ Go into the village opposite you , and as you enter it you will find a colt tethered on which no one has ever sat . Untie it and bring it here . ( K )
NABRE	Luke	19	31	And if anyone should ask you , ‘ Why are you untying it ? ’ you will answer , ‘ The Master has need of it. ’ ”
NABRE	Luke	19	32	So those who had been sent went off and found everything just as he had told them . ( L )
NABRE	Luke	19	33	And as they were untying the colt , its owners said to them , “ Why are you untying this colt ? ”
NABRE	Luke	19	34	They answered , “ The Master has need of it. ”
NABRE	Luke	19	35	( M ) So they brought it to Jesus , threw their cloaks over the colt , and helped Jesus to mount .
NABRE	Luke	19	36	As he rode along , the people were spreading their cloaks on the road ;
NABRE	Luke	19	37	and now as he was approaching the slope of the Mount of Olives , the whole multitude of his disciples began to praise God aloud with joy for all the mighty deeds they had seen .
NABRE	Luke	19	38	They proclaimed : “ Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord . [ g ] Peace in heaven and glory in the highest. ” ( N )
NABRE	Luke	19	39	Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him , “ Teacher , rebuke your disciples. ” [ h ]
NABRE	Luke	19	40	He said in reply , “ I tell you , if they keep silent , the stones will cry out ! ” The Lament for Jerusalem . [ i ]
NABRE	Luke	19	41	( O ) As he drew near , he saw the city and wept over it , ( P )
NABRE	Luke	19	42	saying , “ If this day you only knew what makes for peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes . ( Q )
NABRE	Luke	19	43	[ j ] For the days are coming upon you when your enemies will raise a palisade against you ; they will encircle you and hem you in on all sides . ( R )
NABRE	Luke	19	44	They will smash you to the ground and your children within you , and they will not leave one stone upon another within you because you did not recognize the time of your visitation. ” ( S ) The Cleansing of the Temple .
NABRE	Luke	19	45	( T ) Then Jesus entered the temple area [ k ] and proceeded to drive out those who were selling things , ( U )
NABRE	Luke	19	46	saying to them , “ It is written , ‘ My house shall be a house of prayer , but you have made it a den of thieves. ’ ” ( V )
NABRE	Luke	19	47	And every day he was teaching in the temple area . ( W ) The chief priests , the scribes , and the leaders of the people , meanwhile , were seeking to put him to death , ( X )
NABRE	Luke	19	48	but they could find no way to accomplish their purpose because all the people were hanging on his words . Footnotes - 19:1–10 The story of the tax collector Zacchaeus is unique to this gospel . While a rich man ( Lk 19:2 ) , Zacchaeus provides a contrast to the rich man of Lk 18:18–23 who can not detach himself from his material possessions to become a follower of Jesus . Zacchaeus , according to Luke , exemplifies the proper attitude toward wealth : he promises to give half of his possessions to the poor ( Lk 19:8 ) and consequently is the recipient of salvation ( Lk 19:9–10 ) . - 19:9 A descendant of Abraham : literally , “ a son of Abraham. ” The tax collector Zacchaeus , whose repentance is attested by his determination to amend his former ways , shows himself to be a true descendant of Abraham , the true heir to the promises of God in the Old Testament . Underlying Luke ’ s depiction of Zacchaeus as a descendant of Abraham , the father of the Jews ( Lk 1:73 ; 16:22–31 ) , is his recognition of the central place occupied by Israel in the plan of salvation . - 19:10 This verse sums up for Luke his depiction of the role of Jesus as savior in this gospel . - 19:11–27 In this parable Luke has combined two originally distinct parables : (
NABRE	Luke	19	70	when it was destroyed by the Romans during the First Revolt . - 19:45–46 Immediately upon entering the holy city , Jesus in a display of his authority enters the temple ( see Mal 3:1–3 ) and lays claim to it after cleansing it that it might become a proper place for his teaching ministry in Jerusalem ( Lk 19:47 ; 20:1 ; 21:37 ; 22:53 ) . See Mt 21:12–17 ; Mk 11:15–19 ; Jn 2:13–17 and the notes there .

NABRE	Luke	20	20	[ d ] They watched him closely and sent agents pretending to be righteous who were to trap him in speech , ( L ) in order to hand him over to the authority and power of the governor .
NABRE	Luke	20	1	One day as he was teaching the people in the temple area and proclaiming the good news , the chief priests and scribes , together with the elders , approached him
NABRE	Luke	20	2	and said to him , “ Tell us , by what authority are you doing these things ? Or who is the one who gave you this authority ? ” ( B )
NABRE	Luke	20	3	He said to them in reply , “ I shall ask you a question . Tell me ,
NABRE	Luke	20	4	was John ’ s baptism of heavenly or of human origin ? ” ( C )
NABRE	Luke	20	5	They discussed this among themselves , and said , “ If we say , ‘ Of heavenly origin , ’ he will say , ‘ Why did you not believe him ? ’ ( D )
NABRE	Luke	20	6	But if we say , ‘ Of human origin , ’ then all the people will stone us , for they are convinced that John was a prophet. ”
NABRE	Luke	20	7	So they answered that they did not know from where it came .
NABRE	Luke	20	8	Then Jesus said to them , “ Neither shall I tell you by what authority I do these things. ” The Parable of the Tenant Farmers . [ b ]
NABRE	Luke	20	9	( E ) Then he proceeded to tell the people this parable . “ [ A ] man planted a vineyard , leased it to tenant farmers , and then went on a journey for a long time . ( F )
NABRE	Luke	20	10	At harvest time he sent a servant ( G ) to the tenant farmers to receive some of the produce of the vineyard . But they beat the servant and sent him away empty-handed .
NABRE	Luke	20	11	So he proceeded to send another servant , but him also they beat and insulted and sent away empty-handed .
NABRE	Luke	20	12	Then he proceeded to send a third , but this one too they wounded and threw out .
NABRE	Luke	20	13	The owner of the vineyard said , ‘ What shall I do ? I shall send my beloved son ; maybe they will respect him. ’ ( H )
NABRE	Luke	20	14	But when the tenant farmers saw him they said to one another , ‘ This is the heir . Let us kill him that the inheritance may become ours. ’
NABRE	Luke	20	15	So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . [ c ] What will the owner of the vineyard do to them ?
NABRE	Luke	20	16	He will come and put those tenant farmers to death and turn over the vineyard to others. ” When the people heard this , they exclaimed , “ Let it not be so ! ”
NABRE	Luke	20	17	But he looked at them and asked , “ What then does this scripture passage mean : ‘ The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone ’ ? ( I )
NABRE	Luke	20	18	Everyone who falls on that stone will be dashed to pieces ; and it will crush anyone on whom it falls. ”
NABRE	Luke	20	19	The scribes and chief priests sought to lay their hands on him at that very hour , but they feared the people , for they knew that he had addressed this parable to them . ( J ) Paying Taxes to the Emperor . ( K )
NABRE	Luke	20	21	They posed this question to him , “ Teacher , we know that what you say and teach is correct , and you show no partiality , but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth . ( M )
NABRE	Luke	20	22	Is it lawful for us to pay tribute to Caesar or not ? ” [ e ]
NABRE	Luke	20	23	Recognizing their craftiness he said to them ,
NABRE	Luke	20	24	“ Show me a denarius ; [ f ] whose image and name does it bear ? ” They replied , “ Caesar ’ s. ”
NABRE	Luke	20	25	So he said to them , “ Then repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God. ” ( N )
NABRE	Luke	20	26	They were unable to trap him by something he might say before the people , and so amazed were they at his reply that they fell silent . The Question About the Resurrection . ( O )
NABRE	Luke	20	27	Some Sadducees , [ g ] those who deny that there is a resurrection , came forward and put this question to him , ( P )
NABRE	Luke	20	28	[ h ] saying , “ Teacher , Moses wrote for us , ‘ If someone ’ s brother dies leaving a wife but no child , his brother must take the wife and raise up descendants for his brother. ’ ( Q )
NABRE	Luke	20	29	Now there were seven brothers ; the first married a woman but died childless .
NABRE	Luke	20	30	Then the second
NABRE	Luke	20	31	and the third married her , and likewise all the seven died childless .
NABRE	Luke	20	32	Finally the woman also died .
NABRE	Luke	20	33	Now at the resurrection whose wife will that woman be ? For all seven had been married to her. ”
NABRE	Luke	20	34	Jesus said to them , “ The children of this age marry and are given in marriage ;
NABRE	Luke	20	35	but those who are deemed worthy to attain to the coming age and to the resurrection of the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage .
NABRE	Luke	20	36	They can no longer die , for they are like angels ; and they are the children of God because they are the ones who will rise . [ i ]
NABRE	Luke	20	37	That the dead will rise even Moses made known in the passage about the bush , when he called ‘ Lord ’ the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ; ( R )
NABRE	Luke	20	38	and he is not God of the dead , but of the living , for to him all are alive. ” ( S )
NABRE	Luke	20	39	Some of the scribes said in reply , “ Teacher , you have answered well. ”
NABRE	Luke	20	40	And they no longer dared to ask him anything . ( T ) The Question About David ’ s Son . [ j ]
NABRE	Luke	20	41	( U ) Then he said to them , “ How do they claim that the Messiah is the Son of David ?
NABRE	Luke	20	42	For David himself in the Book of Psalms says : ( V ) ‘ The Lord said to my lord , “ Sit at my right hand
NABRE	Luke	20	43	till I make your enemies your footstool. ” ’
NABRE	Luke	20	44	Now if David calls him ‘ lord , ’ how can he be his son ? ” Denunciation of the Scribes . ( W )
NABRE	Luke	20	45	Then , within the hearing of all the people , he said to [ his ] disciples ,
NABRE	Luke	20	46	“ Be on guard against the scribes , who like to go around in long robes and love greetings in marketplaces , seats of honor in synagogues , and places of honor at banquets . ( X )
NABRE	Luke	20	47	They devour the houses of widows and , as a pretext , recite lengthy prayers . They will receive a very severe condemnation. ” Footnotes - 20:1–47 The Jerusalem religious leaders or their representatives , in an attempt to incriminate Jesus with the Romans and to discredit him with the people , pose a number of questions to him ( about his authority , Lk 20:2 ; about payment of taxes , Lk 20:22 ; about the resurrection , Lk 20:28–33 ) . - 20:9–19 This parable about an absentee landlord and a tenant farmers ’ revolt reflects the social and economic conditions of rural Palestine in the first century . The synoptic gospel writers use the parable to describe how the rejection of the landlord ’ s son becomes the occasion for the vineyard to be taken away from those to whom it was entrusted ( the religious leadership of Judaism that rejects the teaching and preaching of Jesus ; Lk 20:19 ) . - 20:15 They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him : cf . Mk 12:8 . Luke has altered his Marcan source and reports that the murder of the son takes place outside the vineyard to reflect the tradition of Jesus ’ death outside the walls of the city of Jerusalem ( see Hb 13:12 ) . - 20:20 The governor : i.e. , Pontius Pilate , the Roman administrator responsible for the collection of taxes and maintenance of order in Palestine . - 20:22 Through their question the agents of the Jerusalem religious leadership hope to force Jesus to take sides on one of the sensitive political issues of first-century Palestine . The issue of nonpayment of taxes to Rome becomes one of the focal points of the First Jewish Revolt ( A.D. 66–70 ) that resulted in the Roman destruction of Jerusalem and the temple . See also note on Mt 22:15–22 . - 20:24 Denarius : a Roman silver coin ( see note on Lk 7:41 ) . - 20:27 Sadducees : see note on Mt 3:7 . - 20:28–33 The Sadducees ’ question , based on the law of levirate marriage recorded in Dt 25:5–10 , ridicules the idea of the resurrection . Jesus rejects their naive understanding of the resurrection ( Lk 20:35–36 ) and then argues on behalf of the resurrection of the dead on the basis of the written law ( Lk 20:37–38 ) that the Sadducees accept . See also notes on Mt 22:23–33 . - 20:36 Because they are the ones who will rise : literally , “ being sons of the resurrection. ” - 20:41–44 After successfully answering the three questions of his opponents , Jesus now asks them a question . Their inability to respond implies that they have forfeited their position and authority as the religious leaders of the people because they do not understand the scriptures . This series of controversies between the religious leadership of Jerusalem and Jesus reveals Jesus as the authoritative teacher whose words are to be listened to ( see Lk 9:35 ) .

NABRE	Luke	21	21	Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains . Let those within the city escape from it , and let those in the countryside not enter the city , ( P )
NABRE	Luke	21	1	( A ) When he looked up he saw some wealthy people putting their offerings into the treasury
NABRE	Luke	21	2	and he noticed a poor widow putting in two small coins .
NABRE	Luke	21	3	He said , “ I tell you truly , this poor widow put in more than all the rest ;
NABRE	Luke	21	4	for those others have all made offerings from their surplus wealth , but she , from her poverty , has offered her whole livelihood. ” The Destruction of the Temple Foretold . ( B )
NABRE	Luke	21	5	[ b ] While some people were speaking about how the temple was adorned with costly stones and votive offerings , he said ,
NABRE	Luke	21	6	“ All that you see here—the days will come when there will not be left a stone upon another stone that will not be thrown down. ” ( C ) The Signs of the End .
NABRE	Luke	21	7	( D ) Then they asked him , “ Teacher , when will this happen ? And what sign will there be when all these things are about to happen ? ”
NABRE	Luke	21	8	He answered , “ See that you not be deceived , for many will come in my name , saying , ‘ I am he , ’ and ‘ The time has come. ’ [ c ] Do not follow them ! ( E )
NABRE	Luke	21	9	When you hear of wars and insurrections , do not be terrified ; for such things must happen first , but it will not immediately be the end. ”
NABRE	Luke	21	10	Then he said to them , “ Nation will rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom . ( F )
NABRE	Luke	21	11	There will be powerful earthquakes , famines , and plagues from place to place ; and awesome sights and mighty signs will come from the sky . The Coming Persecution .
NABRE	Luke	21	12	( G ) “ Before all this happens , [ d ] however , they will seize and persecute you , they will hand you over to the synagogues and to prisons , and they will have you led before kings and governors because of my name . ( H )
NABRE	Luke	21	13	he has come to terms with what seemed to the early Christian community to be a delay of the parousia . Mark , for example , described the desecration of the Jerusalem temple by the Romans ( Mk 13:14 ) as the apocalyptic symbol ( see Dn 9:27 ; 12:11 ) accompanying the end of the age and the coming of the Son of Man . Luke ( Lk 21:20–24 ) , however , removes the apocalyptic setting and separates the historical destruction of Jerusalem from the signs of the coming of the Son of Man by a period that he refers to as “ the times of the Gentiles ” ( Lk 21:24 ) . See also notes on Mt 24:1–36 and Mk 13:1–37 . - 21:8 The time has come : in Luke , the proclamation of the imminent end of the age has itself become a false teaching . - 21:12 Before all this happens… : to Luke and his community , some of the signs of the end just described ( Lk 21:10–11 ) still lie in the future . Now in dealing with the persecution of the disciples ( Lk 21:12–19 ) and the destruction of Jerusalem ( Lk 21:20–24 ) Luke is pointing to eschatological signs that have already been fulfilled . - 21:15 A wisdom in speaking : literally , “ a mouth and wisdom. ” - 21:20–24 The actual destruction of Jerusalem by Rome in A.D.
NABRE	Luke	21	14	Remember , you are not to prepare your defense beforehand ,
NABRE	Luke	21	15	( I ) for I myself shall give you a wisdom in speaking [ e ] that all your adversaries will be powerless to resist or refute .
NABRE	Luke	21	16	( J ) You will even be handed over by parents , brothers , relatives , and friends , and they will put some of you to death . ( K )
NABRE	Luke	21	17	You will be hated by all because of my name ,
NABRE	Luke	21	18	but not a hair on your head will be destroyed . ( L )

Jesus reinterprets the significance of the Passover by setting it in the context of the kingdom of God ( Lk 22:16 ) . The “ deliverance ” associated with the Passover finds its new meaning in the blood that will be shed ( Lk 22:20 ) . - 22:17 Because of a textual problem in Lk 22:19–20 some commentators interpret this cup as the eucharistic cup . - 22:19c–20 Which will be given…do this in memory of me : these words are omitted in some important Western text manuscripts and a few Syriac manuscripts . Other ancient text types , including the oldest papyrus manuscript of Luke dating from the late second or early third century , contain the longer reading presented here . The Lucan account of the words of institution of the Eucharist bears a close resemblance to the words of institution in the Pauline tradition ( see

NABRE	Luke	22	56	When a maid saw him seated in the light , she looked intently at him and said , “ This man too was with him. ”

Herod has been an important figure in Luke ( Lk 9:7–9 ; 13:31–33 ) and has been presented as someone who has been curious about Jesus for a long time . His curiosity goes unrewarded . It is faith in Jesus , not curiosity , that is rewarded ( Lk 7:50 ; 8:48 ,
NABRE	Luke	23	22	) . This stress on the innocence of Jesus before the Roman authorities is also characteristic of John ’ s gospel ( Jn 18:38 ; 19:4 ,
NABRE	Luke	23	24	The verdict of Pilate was that their demand should be granted .
NABRE	Luke	23	25	So he released the man who had been imprisoned for rebellion and murder , for whom they asked , and he handed Jesus over to them to deal with as they wished . The Way of the Cross . [ d ]
NABRE	Luke	23	26	( M ) As they led him away they took hold of a certain Simon , a Cyrenian , who was coming in from the country ; and after laying the cross on him , they made him carry it behind Jesus .
NABRE	Luke	23	27	A large crowd of people followed Jesus , including many women who mourned and lamented him .
NABRE	Luke	23	28	( N ) Jesus turned to them and said , “ Daughters of Jerusalem , do not weep for me ; weep instead for yourselves and for your children ,
NABRE	Luke	23	29	for indeed , the days are coming when people will say , ‘ Blessed are the barren , the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed. ’

NABRE	Luke	24	25	( O ) And he said to them , “ Oh , how foolish you are ! How slow of heart to believe all that the prophets spoke !
NABRE	Luke	24	26	Was it not necessary that the Messiah should suffer [ h ] these things and enter into his glory ? ”
NABRE	Luke	24	27	Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets , he interpreted to them what referred to him in all the scriptures . ( P )
NABRE	Luke	24	28	As they approached the village to which they were going , he gave the impression that he was going on farther .
NABRE	Luke	24	29	But they urged him , “ Stay with us , for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over. ” So he went in to stay with them .
NABRE	Luke	24	30	And it happened that , while he was with them at table , he took bread , said the blessing , broke it , and gave it to them .
NABRE	Luke	24	31	With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him , but he vanished from their sight .
NABRE	Luke	24	32	Then they said to each other , “ Were not our hearts burning [ within us ] while he spoke to us on the way and opened the scriptures to us ? ”
NABRE	Luke	24	33	So they set out at once and returned to Jerusalem where they found gathered together the eleven and those with them
NABRE	Luke	24	34	who were saying , “ The Lord has truly been raised and has appeared to Simon ! ” ( Q )
NABRE	Luke	24	35	Then the two recounted what had taken place on the way and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread . The Appearance to the Disciples in Jerusalem .
NABRE	Luke	24	36	[ i ] While they were still speaking about this , ( R ) he stood in their midst and said to them , “ Peace be with you. ” ( S )
NABRE	Luke	24	37	But they were startled and terrified and thought that they were seeing a ghost . ( T )
NABRE	Luke	24	38	Then he said to them , “ Why are you troubled ? And why do questions arise in your hearts ?
NABRE	Luke	24	39	[ j ] Look at my hands and my feet , that it is I myself . Touch me and see , because a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you can see I have. ”
NABRE	Luke	24	40	there are omissions in the Western text . - 24:39–42 The apologetic purpose of this story is evident in the concern with the physical details and the report that Jesus ate food . - 24:46 See note on Lk 24:26 . - 24:49 The promise of my Father : i.e. , the gift of the holy Spirit . - 24:50–53 Luke brings his story about the time of Jesus to a close with the report of the ascension . He will also begin the story of the time of the church with a recounting of the ascension . In the gospel , Luke recounts the ascension of Jesus on Easter Sunday night , thereby closely associating it with the resurrection . In Acts 1:3 , 9–11 ; 13:31 he historicizes the ascension by speaking of a forty-day period between the resurrection and the ascension . The Western text omits some phrases in Lk 24:51 ,
NABRE	Luke	24	41	While they were still incredulous for joy and were amazed , he asked them , “ Have you anything here to eat ? ”
NABRE	Luke	24	42	They gave him a piece of baked fish ; ( V )
NABRE	Luke	24	43	he took it and ate it in front of them .
NABRE	Luke	24	44	,
NABRE	Luke	24	45	Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures . ( X )

The idea of a suffering Messiah is not found in the Old Testament or in other Jewish literature prior to the New Testament period , although the idea is hinted at in Mk 8:31–33 . See notes on Mt 26:63 and 26:67–68 . - 24:36–43 , 44–49 The Gospel of Luke , like each of the other gospels ( Mt 28:16–20 ; Mk 16:14–15 ; Jn 20:19–23 ) , focuses on an important appearance of Jesus to the Twelve in which they are commissioned for their future ministry . As in Lk 24:6 ,
NABRE	Luke	24	47	and that repentance , for the forgiveness of sins , would be preached in his name to all the nations , beginning from Jerusalem . ( Z )

NABRE	Luke	24	50	( AC ) Then he led them [ out ] as far as Bethany , raised his hands , and blessed them .
NABRE	Luke	24	51	As he blessed them he parted from them and was taken up to heaven .
NABRE	Luke	24	52	perhaps to avoid any chronological conflict with Acts

NABRE	Luke	24	160	stades ” or more than eighteen miles . The exact location of Emmaus is disputed . - 24:16 A consistent feature of the resurrection stories is that the risen Jesus was different and initially unrecognizable ( Lk 24:37 ; Mk 16:12 ; Jn 20:14 ; 21:4 ) . - 24:26 That the Messiah should suffer… : Luke is the only New Testament writer to speak explicitly of a suffering Messiah ( Lk 24:26 ,

NABRE	John	1	1	) about the kinship of Jesus and John the Baptist . The reason why I came baptizing with water : in this gospel , John ’ s baptism is not connected with forgiveness of sins ; its purpose is revelatory , that Jesus may be made known to Israel . - 1:32 Like a dove : a symbol of the new creation ( Gn 8:8 ) or the community of Israel ( Hos 11:11 ) . Remain : the first use of a favorite verb in John , emphasizing the permanency of the relationship between Father and Son ( as here ) and between the Son and the Christian . Jesus is the permanent bearer of the Spirit . - 1:34 The Son of God : this reading is supported by good Greek manuscripts , including the Chester Beatty and Bodmer Papyri and the Vatican Codex , but is suspect because it harmonizes this passage with the synoptic version : “ This is my beloved Son ” ( Mt 3:17 ; Mk 1:11 ; Lk 3:22 ) . The poorly attested alternate reading , “ God ’ s chosen One , ” is probably a reference to the Servant of Yahweh ( Is 42:1 ) . - 1:36 John the Baptist ’ s testimony makes his disciples ’ following of Jesus plausible . - 1:37 The two disciples : Andrew ( Jn 1:40 ) and , traditionally , John , son of Zebedee ( see note on Jn 13:23 ) . - 1:39 Four in the afternoon : literally , the tenth hour , from sunrise , in the Roman calculation of time . Some suggest that the next day , beginning at sunset , was the sabbath ; they would have stayed with Jesus to avoid travel on it . - 1:41 Messiah : the Hebrew word māšîaḥ , “ anointed one ” ( see note on Lk 2:11 ) , appears in Greek as the transliterated messias only here and in Jn 4:25 . Elsewhere the Greek translation christos is used . - 1:42 Simon , the son of John : in Mt 16:17 , Simon is called Bariōna , “ son of Jonah , ” a different tradition for the name of Simon ’ s father . Cephas : in Aramaic = the Rock ; cf . Mt 16:18 . Neither the Greek equivalent Petros nor , with one isolated exception , Cephas is attested as a personal name before Christian times . - 1:43 He : grammatically , could be Peter , but logically is probably Jesus . - 1:47 A true Israelite . There is no duplicity in him : Jacob was the first to bear the name “ Israel ” ( Gn 32:29 ) , but Jacob was a man of duplicity ( Gn 27:35–36 ) . - 1:48 Under the fig tree : a symbol of messianic peace ( cf . Mi 4:4 ; Zec 3:10 ) . - 1:49 Son of God : this title is used in the Old Testament , among other ways , as a title of adoption for the Davidic king (
NABRE	John	1	2	Sm 7:14 ; Ps 2:7 ; 89:27 ) , and thus here , with King of Israel , in a messianic sense . For the evangelist , Son of God also points to Jesus ’ divinity ( cf . Jn 20:28 ) . - 1:50 Possibly a statement : “ You [ singular ] believe because I saw you under the fig tree. ” - 1:51 The double “ Amen ” is characteristic of John . You is plural in Greek . The allusion is to Jacob ’ s ladder ( Gn 28:12 ) .

NABRE	John	1	7	) . Made his dwelling : literally , “ pitched his tent/tabernacle. ” Cf . the tabernacle or tent of meeting that was the place of God ’ s presence among his people ( Ex 25:8–9 ) . The incarnate Word is the new mode of God ’ s presence among his people . The Greek verb has the same consonants as the Aramaic word for God ’ s presence ( Shekinah ) . Glory : God ’ s visible manifestation of majesty in power , which once filled the tabernacle ( Ex 40:34 ) and the temple (

NABRE	John	1	10	) . - 1:30 He existed before me : possibly as Elijah ( to come , Jn 1:27 ) ; for the evangelist and his audience , Jesus ’ preexistence would be implied ( see note on Jn 1:1 ) . - 1:31 I did not know him : this gospel shows no knowledge of the tradition ( Lk
NABRE	John	1	11	He came to what was his own , but his own people [ g ] did not accept him .

NABRE	John	1	13	[ h ] ( J ) who were born not by natural generation nor by human choice nor by a man ’ s decision but of God .
NABRE	John	1	14	) is poetic in structure , with short phrases linked by “ staircase parallelism , ” in which the last word of one phrase becomes the first word of the next . Prose inserts ( at least Jn 1:6–8 ,
NABRE	John	1	15	) deal with John the Baptist . - 1:1 In the beginning : also the first words of the Old Testament ( Gn 1:1 ) . Was : this verb is used three times with different meanings in this verse : existence , relationship , and predication . The Word ( Greek logos ) : this term combines God ’ s dynamic , creative word ( Genesis ) , personified preexistent Wisdom as the instrument of God ’ s creative activity ( Proverbs ) , and the ultimate intelligibility of reality ( Hellenistic philosophy ) . With God : the Greek preposition here connotes communication with another . Was God : lack of a definite article with “ God ” in Greek signifies predication rather than identification . - 1:3 What came to be : while the oldest manuscripts have no punctuation here , the corrector of Bodmer Papyrus P75 , some manuscripts , and the Ante-Nicene Fathers take this phrase with what follows , as staircase parallelism . Connection with Jn 1:3 reflects fourth-century anti-Arianism . - 1:5 The ethical dualism of light and darkness is paralleled in intertestamental literature and in the Dead Sea Scrolls . Overcome : “ comprehend ” is another possible translation , but cf . Jn 12:35 ; Wis 7:29–30 . - 1:6 John was sent just as Jesus was “ sent ” ( Jn 4:34 ) in divine mission . Other references to John the Baptist in this gospel emphasize the differences between them and John ’ s subordinate role . - 1:7 Testimony : the testimony theme of John is introduced , which portrays Jesus as if on trial throughout his ministry . All testify to Jesus : John the Baptist , the Samaritan woman , scripture , his works , the crowds , the Spirit , and his disciples . - 1:11 What was his own…his own people : first a neuter , literally , “ his own property/possession ” ( probably = Israel ) , then a masculine , “ his own people ” ( the Israelites ) . - 1:13 Believers in Jesus become children of God not through any of the three natural causes mentioned but through God who is the immediate cause of the new spiritual life . Were born : the Greek verb can mean “ begotten ” ( by a male ) or “ born ” ( from a female or of parents ) . The variant “ he who was begotten , ” asserting Jesus ’ virginal conception , is weakly attested in Old Latin and Syriac versions . - 1:14 Flesh : the whole person , used probably against docetic tendencies ( cf .
NABRE	John	1	16	seems drawn from Jn 1:30 . - 1:16 Grace in place of grace : replacement of the Old Covenant with the New ( cf . Jn 1:17 ) . Other possible translations are “ grace upon grace ” ( accumulation ) and “ grace for grace ” ( correspondence ) . - 1:18 The only Son , God : while the vast majority of later textual witnesses have another reading , “ the Son , the only one ” or “ the only Son , ” the translation above follows the best and earliest manuscripts , monogenēs theos , but takes the first term to mean not just “ Only One ” but to include a filial relationship with the Father , as at Lk 9:38 ( “ only child ” ) or Hb 11:17 ( “ only son ” ) and as translated at Jn 1:14 . The Logos is thus “ only Son ” and God but not Father/God . - 1:19–51 The testimony of John the Baptist about the Messiah and Jesus ’ self-revelation to the first disciples . This section constitutes the introduction to the gospel proper and is connected with the prose inserts in the prologue . It develops the major theme of testimony in four scenes : John ’ s negative testimony about himself ; his positive testimony about Jesus ; the revelation of Jesus to Andrew and Peter ; the revelation of Jesus to Philip and Nathanael . - 1:19 The Jews : throughout most of the gospel , the “ Jews ” does not refer to the Jewish people as such but to the hostile authorities , both Pharisees and Sadducees , particularly in Jerusalem , who refuse to believe in Jesus . The usage reflects the atmosphere , at the end of the first century , of polemics between church and synagogue , or possibly it refers to Jews as representative of a hostile world ( Jn 1:10–11 ) . - 1:20 Messiah : the anointed agent of Yahweh , usually considered to be of Davidic descent . See further the note on Jn 1:41 . - 1:21 Elijah : the Baptist did not claim to be Elijah returned to earth ( cf . Mal 3:19 ; Mt 11:14 ) . The Prophet : probably the prophet like Moses ( Dt 18:15 ; cf . Acts 3:22 ) . - 1:23 This is a repunctuation and reinterpretation ( as in the synoptic gospels and Septuagint ) of the Hebrew text of Is 40:3 which reads , “ A voice cries out : In the desert prepare the way of the Lord. ” - 1:24 Some Pharisees : other translations , such as “ Now they had been sent from the Pharisees , ” misunderstand the grammatical construction . This is a different group from that in Jn 1:19 ; the priests and Levites would have been Sadducees , not Pharisees . - 1:26 I baptize with water : the synoptics add “ but he will baptize you with the holy Spirit ” ( Mk 1:8 ) or “ …holy Spirit and fire ” ( Mt 3:11 ; Lk 3:16 ) . John ’ s emphasis is on purification and preparation for a better baptism . - 1:28 Bethany across the Jordan : site unknown . Another reading is “ Bethabara. ” - 1:29 The Lamb of God : the background for this title may be the victorious apocalyptic lamb who would destroy evil in the world ( Rev 5–7 ; 17:14 ) ; the paschal lamb , whose blood saved Israel ( Ex

NABRE	John	1	20	[ o ] he admitted and did not deny it , but admitted , ( O ) “ I am not the Messiah. ”

NABRE	John	1	23	He said : as Isaiah the prophet said. ”
NABRE	John	1	24	Some Pharisees [ r ] were also sent .
NABRE	John	1	25	They asked him , “ Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah or Elijah or the Prophet ? ” ( R )

Grace and truth : these words may represent two Old Testament terms describing Yahweh in covenant relationship with Israel ( cf . Ex 34:6 ) , thus God ’ s “ love ” and “ fidelity. ” The Word shares Yahweh ’ s covenant qualities . - 1:15 This verse , interrupting Jn 1:14 ,
NABRE	John	1	28	This happened in Bethany across the Jordan , [ t ] where John was baptizing . John the Baptist ’ s Testimony to Jesus .
NABRE	John	1	29	The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him and said , “ Behold , the Lamb of God , [ u ] who takes away the sin of the world . ( T )
NABRE	John	1	30	[ v ] He is the one of whom I said , ( U ) ‘ A man is coming after me who ranks ahead of me because he existed before me. ’
NABRE	John	1	31	I did not know him , [ w ] but the reason why I came baptizing with water was that he might be made known to Israel. ”
NABRE	John	1	32	John testified further , saying , “ I saw the Spirit come down like a dove [ x ] from the sky and remain upon him .
NABRE	John	1	33	I did not know him , ( V ) but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me , ‘ On whomever you see the Spirit come down and remain , he is the one who will baptize with the holy Spirit. ’ ( W )

NABRE	John	1	35	The next day John was there again with two of his disciples ,
NABRE	John	1	36	and as he watched Jesus walk by , he said , “ Behold , the Lamb of God. ” [ z ]
NABRE	John	1	37	The two disciples [ aa ] heard what he said and followed Jesus .
NABRE	John	1	38	Jesus turned and saw them following him and said to them , “ What are you looking for ? ” They said to him , “ Rabbi ” ( which translated means Teacher ) , “ where are you staying ? ”
NABRE	John	1	39	He said to them , “ Come , and you will see. ” So they went and saw where he was staying , and they stayed with him that day . It was about four in the afternoon . [ ab ]
NABRE	John	1	40	Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , was one of the two who heard John and followed Jesus .
NABRE	John	1	41	He first found his own brother Simon and told him , “ We have found the Messiah ” [ ac ] ( which is translated Anointed ) . ( Z )
NABRE	John	1	42	Then he brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him and said , “ You are Simon the son of John ; [ ad ] you will be called Cephas ” ( which is translated Peter ) . ( AA )
NABRE	John	1	43	The next day he [ ae ] decided to go to Galilee , and he found Philip . And Jesus said to him , “ Follow me. ”
NABRE	John	1	44	Now Philip was from Bethsaida , the town of Andrew and Peter .
NABRE	John	1	45	Philip found Nathanael and told him , “ We have found the one about whom Moses wrote in the law , and also the prophets , Jesus son of Joseph , from Nazareth. ” ( AB )
NABRE	John	1	46	But Nathanael said to him , “ Can anything good come from Nazareth ? ” Philip said to him , “ Come and see. ”
NABRE	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him , “ Here is a true Israelite . [ af ] There is no duplicity in him. ”
NABRE	John	1	48	[ ag ] ( AC ) Nathanael said to him , “ How do you know me ? ” Jesus answered and said to him , “ Before Philip called you , I saw you under the fig tree. ”
NABRE	John	1	49	Nathanael answered him , “ Rabbi , you are the Son of God ; [ ah ] you are the King of Israel. ” ( AD )
NABRE	John	1	50	Jesus answered and said to him , “ Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree ? [ ai ] You will see greater things than this. ”
NABRE	John	1	51	And he said to him , “ Amen , amen , [ aj ] I say to you , you will see the sky opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man. ” ( AE ) Footnotes - 1:1–18 The prologue states the main themes of the gospel : life , light , truth , the world , testimony , and the preexistence of Jesus Christ , the incarnate Logos , who reveals God the Father . In origin , it was probably an early Christian hymn . Its closest parallel is in other christological hymns , Col 1:15–20 and Phil 2:6–11 . Its core ( Jn 1:1–5 , 10–11 ,

NABRE	John	2	1	Kgs 17:18 ) or denial of common interest ( Hos 14:9 ;
NABRE	John	2	3	When the wine ran short , the mother of Jesus said to him , “ They have no wine. ”
NABRE	John	2	4	[ d ] [ And ] Jesus said to her , “ Woman , how does your concern affect me ? My hour has not yet come. ” ( B )
NABRE	John	2	5	His mother said to the servers , “ Do whatever he tells you. ” ( C )
NABRE	John	2	6	[ e ] Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washings , ( D ) each holding twenty to thirty gallons .
NABRE	John	2	7	Jesus told them , “ Fill the jars with water. ” So they filled them to the brim .
NABRE	John	2	8	Then he told them , “ Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter. ” [ f ] So they took it .
NABRE	John	2	9	And when the headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine , without knowing where it came from ( although the servers who had drawn the water knew ) , the headwaiter called the bridegroom
NABRE	John	2	10	and said to him , “ Everyone serves good wine first , and then when people have drunk freely , an inferior one ; but you have kept the good wine until now. ”
NABRE	John	2	11	Jesus did this as the beginning of his signs [ g ] in Cana in Galilee and so revealed his glory , and his disciples began to believe in him . ( E )
NABRE	John	2	12	[ h ] After this , he and his mother , [ his ] brothers , and his disciples went down to Capernaum and stayed there only a few days . [ i ] Cleansing of the Temple .
NABRE	John	2	13	[ j ] Since the Passover [ k ] of the Jews was near , ( F ) Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
NABRE	John	2	14	[ l ] He found in the temple area those who sold oxen , sheep , and doves , [ m ] as well as the money-changers seated there . ( G )
NABRE	John	2	15	He made a whip out of cords and drove them all out of the temple area , with the sheep and oxen , and spilled the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables ,
NABRE	John	2	16	and to those who sold doves he said , “ Take these out of here , and stop making my Father ’ s house a marketplace. ” ( H )
NABRE	John	2	17	[ n ] His disciples recalled the words of scripture , ( I ) “ Zeal for your house will consume me. ”
NABRE	John	2	18	At this the Jews answered and said to him , “ What sign can you show us for doing this ? ” ( J )
NABRE	John	2	19	Jesus answered and said to them , [ o ] ( K ) “ Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up. ”
NABRE	John	2	20	The Jews said , “ This temple has been under construction for forty-six years , [ p ] and you will raise it up in three days ? ”
NABRE	John	2	21	But he was speaking about the temple of his body .
NABRE	John	2	22	Therefore , when he was raised from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this , and they came to believe the scripture and the word Jesus had spoken . ( L )
NABRE	John	2	23	While he was in Jerusalem for the feast of Passover , many began to believe in his name when they saw the signs he was doing . ( M )
NABRE	John	2	24	But Jesus would not trust himself to them because he knew them all ,
NABRE	John	2	25	and did not need anyone to testify about human nature . He himself understood it well . ( N ) Footnotes - 2:1–6:71 Signs revealing Jesus as the Messiah to all Israel . “ Sign ” ( sēmeion ) is John ’ s symbolic term for Jesus ’ wondrous deeds ( see Introduction ) . The Old Testament background lies in the Exodus story ( cf . Dt 11:3 ; 29:2 ) . John is interested primarily in what the sēmeia signify : God ’ s intervention in human history in a new way through Jesus . - 2:1–11 The first sign . This story of replacement of Jewish ceremonial washings ( Jn 2:6 ) presents the initial revelation about Jesus at the outset of his ministry . He manifests his glory ; the disciples believe . There is no synoptic parallel . - 2:1 Cana : unknown from the Old Testament . The mother of Jesus : she is never named in John . - 2:4 This verse may seek to show that Jesus did not work miracles to help his family and friends , as in the apocryphal gospels . Woman : a normal , polite form of address , but unattested in reference to one ’ s mother . Cf . also Jn 19:26 . How does your concern affect me ? : literally , “ What is this to me and to you ? ” —a Hebrew expression of either hostility ( Jgs 11:12 ;
NABRE	John	2	30	. The “ hour ” is that of Jesus ’ passion , death , resurrection , and ascension ( Jn 13:1 ) . - 2:6 Twenty to thirty gallons : literally , “ two or three measures ” ; the Attic liquid measure contained 39.39 liters . The vast quantity recalls prophecies of abundance in the last days ; cf . Am 9:13–14 ; Hos 14:7 ; Jer 31:12 . - 2:8 Headwaiter : used of the official who managed a banquet , but there is no evidence of such a functionary in Palestine . Perhaps here a friend of the family acted as master of ceremonies ; cf . Sir 32:1 . - 2:11 The beginning of his signs : the first of seven ( see Introduction ) . - 2:12–3:21 The next three episodes take place in Jerusalem . Only the first is paralleled in the synoptic gospels . - 2:12 This transitional verse may be a harmonization with the synoptic tradition in Lk 4:31 and Mt 4:13 . There are many textual variants . John depicts no extended ministry in Capernaum as do the synoptics . - 2:13–22 This episode indicates the post-resurrectional replacement of the temple by the person of Jesus . - 2:13 Passover : this is the first Passover mentioned in John ; a second is mentioned in Jn 6:4 ; a third in Jn 13:1 . Taken literally , they point to a ministry of at least two years . - 2:14–22 The other gospels place the cleansing of the temple in the last days of Jesus ’ life ( Matthew , on the day Jesus entered Jerusalem ; Mark , on the next day ) . The order of events in the gospel narratives is often determined by theological motives rather than by chronological data . - 2:14 Oxen , sheep , and doves : intended for sacrifice . The doves were the offerings of the poor ( Lv 5:7 ) . Money-changers : for a temple tax paid by every male Jew more than nineteen years of age , with a half-shekel coin ( Ex 30:11–16 ) , in Syrian currency . See note on Mt 17:24 . - 2:17 Ps 69:10 , changed to future tense to apply to Jesus . - 2:19 This saying about the destruction of the temple occurs in various forms ( Mt 24:2 ; 27:40 ; Mk 13:2 ; 15:29 ; Lk 21:6 ; cf . Acts 6:14 ) . Mt 26:61 has : “ I can destroy the temple of God… ” ; see note there . In Mk 14:58 , there is a metaphorical contrast with a new temple : “ I will destroy this temple made with hands and within three days I will build another not made with hands. ” Here it is symbolic of Jesus ’ resurrection and the resulting community ( see Jn 2:21 and Rev 21:2 ) . In three days : an Old Testament expression for a short , indefinite period of time ; cf . Hos 6:2 . - 2:20 Forty-six years : based on references in Josephus ( Jewish Wars 1:401 ; Antiquities 15:380 ) , possibly the spring of A.D.

NABRE	John	3	3	Jesus answered and said to him , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , no one can see the kingdom of God without being born [ c ] from above. ”
NABRE	John	3	1	( A ) Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews . [ b ]
NABRE	John	3	2	. This is the first of the Johannine discourses , shifting from dialogue to monologue ( Jn 3:11–15 ) to reflection of the evangelist ( Jn 3:16–21 ) . The shift from singular through Jn 3:10 to plural in Jn 3:11 may reflect the early church ’ s controversy with the Jews . - 3:1 A ruler of the Jews : most likely a member of the Jewish council , the Sanhedrin ; see note on Mk 8:31 . - 3:3 Born : see note on Jn 1:13 . From above : the Greek adverb anōthen means both “ from above ” and “ again. ” Jesus means “ from above ” ( see Jn 3:31 ) but Nicodemus misunderstands it as “ again. ” This misunderstanding serves as a springboard for further instruction . - 3:8 Wind : the Greek word pneuma ( as well as the Hebrew rûah ) means both “ wind ” and “ spirit. ” In the play on the double meaning , “ wind ” is primary . - 3:14 Lifted up : in Nm 21:9 , Moses simply “ mounted ” a serpent upon a pole . John here substitutes a verb implying glorification . Jesus , exalted to glory at his cross and resurrection , represents healing for all . - 3:15 Eternal life : used here for the first time in John , this term stresses quality of life rather than duration . - 3:16 Gave : as a gift in the incarnation , and also “ over to death ” in the crucifixion ; cf . Rom 8:32 . - 3:17–19 Condemn : the Greek root means both judgment and condemnation . Jesus ’ purpose is to save , but his coming provokes judgment ; some condemn themselves by turning from the light . - 3:19 Judgment is not only future but is partially realized here and now . - 3:22–26 Jesus ’ ministry in Judea is only loosely connected with Jn 2:13–3:21 ; cf . Jn 1:19–36 . Perhaps John the Baptist ’ s further testimony was transposed here to give meaning to “ water ” in Jn 3:5 . Jesus is depicted as baptizing ( Jn 3:22 ) ; contrast Jn 4:2 . - 3:23 Aenon near Salim : site uncertain , either in the upper Jordan valley or in Samaria . - 3:24 A remark probably intended to avoid objections based on a chronology like that of the synoptics ( Mt 4:12 ; Mk 1:14 ) . - 3:25 A Jew : some think Jesus is meant . Many manuscripts read “ Jews. ” - 3:29 The best man : literally , “ the friend of the groom , ” the shoshben of Jewish tradition , who arranged the wedding . Competition between him and the groom would be unthinkable . - 3:31–36 It is uncertain whether these are words by the Baptist , Jesus , or the evangelist . They are reflections on the two preceding scenes . - 3:34 His gift : of God or to Jesus , perhaps both . This verse echoes Jn 3:5 ,
NABRE	John	3	4	Nicodemus said to him , “ How can a person once grown old be born again ? Surely he can not reenter his mother ’ s womb and be born again , can he ? ” ( C )
NABRE	John	3	5	Jesus answered , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and Spirit . ( D )
NABRE	John	3	6	What is born of flesh is flesh and what is born of spirit is spirit . ( E )
NABRE	John	3	7	Do not be amazed that I told you , ‘ You must be born from above. ’

NABRE	John	3	9	Nicodemus answered and said to him , “ How can this happen ? ”
NABRE	John	3	10	Jesus answered and said to him , “ You are the teacher of Israel and you do not understand this ?
NABRE	John	3	11	Amen , amen , I say to you , we speak of what we know and we testify to what we have seen , but you people do not accept our testimony . ( G )
NABRE	John	3	12	If I tell you about earthly things and you do not believe , how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things ? ( H )
NABRE	John	3	13	No one has gone up to heaven except the one who has come down from heaven , the Son of Man . ( I )
NABRE	John	3	14	And just as Moses lifted up [ e ] the serpent in the desert , so must the Son of Man be lifted up , ( J )
NABRE	John	3	15	[ f ] so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. ”
NABRE	John	3	16	For God so loved the world that he gave [ g ] his only Son , so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life . ( K )
NABRE	John	3	17	For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn [ h ] the world , but that the world might be saved through him . ( L )
NABRE	John	3	18	Whoever believes in him will not be condemned , but whoever does not believe has already been condemned , because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God . ( M )
NABRE	John	3	19	[ i ] And this is the verdict , ( N ) that the light came into the world , but people preferred darkness to light , because their works were evil .
NABRE	John	3	20	For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come toward the light , so that his works might not be exposed . ( O )
NABRE	John	3	21	But whoever lives the truth comes to the light , so that his works may be clearly seen as done in God . ( P ) Final Witness of the Baptist .
NABRE	John	3	22	[ j ] After this , Jesus and his disciples went into the region of Judea , where he spent some time with them baptizing . ( Q )
NABRE	John	3	23	John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim , [ k ] because there was an abundance of water there , and people came to be baptized ,
NABRE	John	3	24	[ l ] ( R ) for John had not yet been imprisoned .
NABRE	John	3	25	Now a dispute arose between the disciples of John and a Jew [ m ] about ceremonial washings .
NABRE	John	3	26	So they came to John and said to him , “ Rabbi , the one who was with you across the Jordan , to whom you testified , here he is baptizing and everyone is coming to him. ” ( S )
NABRE	John	3	27	John answered and said , “ No one can receive anything except what has been given him from heaven . ( T )
NABRE	John	3	28	You yourselves can testify that I said [ that ] I am not the Messiah , but that I was sent before him . ( U )
NABRE	John	3	29	The one who has the bride is the bridegroom ; the best man , [ n ] who stands and listens to him , rejoices greatly at the bridegroom ’ s voice . So this joy of mine has been made complete . ( V )
NABRE	John	3	30	He must increase ; I must decrease. ” ( W ) The One from Heaven . [ o ]
NABRE	John	3	31	The one who comes from above is above all . The one who is of the earth is earthly and speaks of earthly things . But the one who comes from heaven [ is above all ] . ( X )
NABRE	John	3	32	He testifies to what he has seen and heard , but no one accepts his testimony . ( Y )
NABRE	John	3	33	Whoever does accept his testimony certifies that God is trustworthy . ( Z )
NABRE	John	3	34	For the one whom God sent speaks the words of God . He does not ration his gift [ p ] of the Spirit .
NABRE	John	3	35	The Father loves the Son and has given everything over to him . ( AA )
NABRE	John	3	36	Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life , but whoever disobeys the Son will not see life , but the wrath of God remains upon him . ( AB ) Footnotes - 3:1–21 Jesus instructs Nicodemus on the necessity of a new birth from above . This scene in Jerusalem at Passover exemplifies the faith engendered by signs ( Jn 2:23 ) . It continues the self-manifestation of Jesus in Jerusalem begun in Jn

NABRE	John	4	4	He had to [ c ] pass through Samaria .
NABRE	John	4	1	[ a ] Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
NABRE	John	4	2	( although Jesus himself was not baptizing , just his disciples ) , [ b ]
NABRE	John	4	3	he left Judea and returned to Galilee . The Samaritan Woman .
NABRE	John	4	5	So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar , [ d ] near the plot of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph . ( A )
NABRE	John	4	6	Jacob ’ s well was there . Jesus , tired from his journey , sat down there at the well . It was about noon .
NABRE	John	4	7	A woman of Samaria came to draw water . Jesus said to her , “ Give me a drink. ”
NABRE	John	4	8	. See note on Mk 6:50 . - 4:27 Talking with a woman : a religious and social restriction that Jesus is pictured treating as unimportant . - 4:35 ‘ In four months… ’ : probably a proverb ; cf . Mt 9:37–38 . - 4:36 Already : this word may go with the preceding verse rather than with Jn 4:36 . - 4:39 The woman is presented as a missionary , described in virtually the same words as the disciples are in Jesus ’ prayer ( Jn 17:20 ) . - 4:43–54 Jesus ’ arrival in Cana in Galilee ; the second sign . This section introduces another theme , that of the life-giving word of Jesus . It is explicitly linked to the first sign ( Jn 2:11 ) . The royal official believes ( Jn 4:50 ) . The natural life given his son is a sign of eternal life . - 4:44 Probably a reminiscence of a tradition as in Mk 6:4 . Cf . Gospel of Thomas
NABRE	John	4	9	[ e ] The Samaritan woman said to him , “ How can you , a Jew , ask me , a Samaritan woman , for a drink ? ” ( B ) ( For Jews use nothing in common with Samaritans . )
NABRE	John	4	10	[ f ] Jesus answered and said to her , ( C ) “ If you knew the gift of God and who is saying to you , ‘ Give me a drink , ’ you would have asked him and he would have given you living water. ”
NABRE	John	4	11	[ The woman ] said to him , “ Sir , [ g ] you do not even have a bucket and the well is deep ; where then can you get this living water ?
NABRE	John	4	12	Are you greater than our father Jacob , who gave us this well and drank from it himself with his children and his flocks ? ” ( D )
NABRE	John	4	13	Jesus answered and said to her , “ Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again ;
NABRE	John	4	14	but whoever drinks the water I shall give will never thirst ; the water I shall give will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life. ” ( E )
NABRE	John	4	15	The woman said to him , “ Sir , give me this water , so that I may not be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water. ”
NABRE	John	4	16	Jesus said to her , “ Go call your husband and come back. ”
NABRE	John	4	17	The woman answered and said to him , “ I do not have a husband. ” Jesus answered her , “ You are right in saying , ‘ I do not have a husband. ’
NABRE	John	4	18	For you have had five husbands , and the one you have now is not your husband . What you have said is true. ” ( F )
NABRE	John	4	19	The woman said to him , “ Sir , I can see that you are a prophet . ( G )
NABRE	John	4	20	Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain ; [ h ] but you people say that the place to worship is in Jerusalem. ” ( H )
NABRE	John	4	21	Jesus said to her , “ Believe me , woman , the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem .
NABRE	John	4	22	You people worship what you do not understand ; we worship what we understand , because salvation is from the Jews . ( I )
NABRE	John	4	23	But the hour is coming , and is now here , when true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and truth ; [ i ] and indeed the Father seeks such people to worship him .
NABRE	John	4	24	God is Spirit , and those who worship him must worship in Spirit and truth. ” ( J )
NABRE	John	4	25	[ j ] The woman said to him , “ I know that the Messiah is coming , ( K ) the one called the Anointed ; when he comes , he will tell us everything. ”
NABRE	John	4	26	Jesus said to her , “ I am he , [ k ] the one who is speaking with you. ” ( L )
NABRE	John	4	27	At that moment his disciples returned , and were amazed that he was talking with a woman , [ l ] but still no one said , “ What are you looking for ? ” or “ Why are you talking with her ? ”
NABRE	John	4	28	,
NABRE	John	4	29	“ Come see a man who told me everything I have done . Could he possibly be the Messiah ? ”
NABRE	John	4	30	They went out of the town and came to him .
NABRE	John	4	31	: “ No prophet is acceptable in his village , no physician heals those who know him. ” - 4:46–54 The story of the cure of the royal official ’ s son may be a third version of the cure of the centurion ’ s son ( Mt 8:5–13 ) or servant ( Lk 7:1–10 ) . Cf . also Mt 15:21–28 ; Mk 7:24–30 . Scripture texts , prefaces , introductions , footnotes and cross references used in this work are taken from the New American Bible , revised edition ©
NABRE	John	4	32	But he said to them , “ I have food to eat of which you do not know. ”
NABRE	John	4	33	So the disciples said to one another , “ Could someone have brought him something to eat ? ”
NABRE	John	4	34	Jesus said to them , “ My food is to do the will of the one who sent me and to finish his work . ( M )
NABRE	John	4	35	Do you not say , ‘ In four months [ m ] the harvest will be here ’ ? I tell you , look up and see the fields ripe for the harvest . ( N )
NABRE	John	4	36	The reaper is already [ n ] receiving his payment and gathering crops for eternal life , so that the sower and reaper can rejoice together . ( O )
NABRE	John	4	37	For here the saying is verified that ‘ One sows and another reaps. ’ ( P )
NABRE	John	4	38	I sent you to reap what you have not worked for ; others have done the work , and you are sharing the fruits of their work. ”
NABRE	John	4	39	Many of the Samaritans of that town began to believe in him because of the word of the woman [ o ] who testified , “ He told me everything I have done. ”
NABRE	John	4	40	When the Samaritans came to him , they invited him to stay with them ; and he stayed there two days .
NABRE	John	4	41	Many more began to believe in him because of his word ,
NABRE	John	4	42	and they said to the woman , “ We no longer believe because of your word ; for we have heard for ourselves , and we know that this is truly the savior of the world. ” ( Q ) Return to Galilee .
NABRE	John	4	43	[ p ] After the two days , he left there for Galilee .
NABRE	John	4	44	[ q ] ( R ) For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his native place .
NABRE	John	4	45	When he came into Galilee , the Galileans welcomed him , since they had seen all he had done in Jerusalem at the feast ; for they themselves had gone to the feast . Second Sign at Cana . [ r ]
NABRE	John	4	46	( S ) Then he returned to Cana in Galilee , where he had made the water wine . Now there was a royal official whose son was ill in Capernaum .
NABRE	John	4	47	When he heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea , he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son , who was near death .
NABRE	John	4	48	Jesus said to him , “ Unless you people see signs and wonders , you will not believe. ” ( T )
NABRE	John	4	49	The royal official said to him , “ Sir , come down before my child dies. ”
NABRE	John	4	50	Jesus said to him , “ You may go ; your son will live. ” The man believed what Jesus said to him and left . ( U )
NABRE	John	4	51	While he was on his way back , his slaves met him and told him that his boy would live .
NABRE	John	4	52	He asked them when he began to recover . They told him , “ The fever left him yesterday , about one in the afternoon. ”
NABRE	John	4	53	The father realized that just at that time Jesus had said to him , “ Your son will live , ” and he and his whole household came to believe .
NABRE	John	4	54	[ Now ] this was the second sign Jesus did when he came to Galilee from Judea . ( V ) Footnotes - 4:1–42 Jesus in Samaria . The self-revelation of Jesus continues with his second discourse , on his mission to “ half-Jews. ” It continues the theme of replacement , here with regard to cult ( Jn 4:21 ) . Water ( Jn 4:7–15 ) serves as a symbol ( as at Cana and in the Nicodemus episode ) . - 4:2 An editorial refinement of Jn 3:22 , perhaps directed against followers of John the Baptist who claimed that Jesus imitated him . - 4:4 He had to : a theological necessity ; geographically , Jews often bypassed Samaria by taking a route across the Jordan . - 4:5 Sychar : Jerome identifies this with Shechem , a reading found in Syriac manuscripts . - 4:9 Samaritan women were regarded by Jews as ritually impure , and therefore Jews were forbidden to drink from any vessel they had handled . - 4:10 Living water : the water of life , i.e. , the revelation that Jesus brings ; the woman thinks of “ flowing water , ” so much more desirable than stagnant well water . On John ’ s device of such misunderstanding , cf . note on Jn 3:3 . - 4:11 Sir : the Greek kyrios means “ master ” or “ lord , ” as a respectful mode of address for a human being or a deity ; cf . Jn 4:19 . It is also the word used in the Septuagint for the Hebrew ’ adônai , substituted for the tetragrammaton YHWH . - 4:20 This mountain : Gerizim , on which a temple was erected in the fourth century B.C . by Samaritans to rival Mount Zion in Jerusalem ; cf . Dt 27:4 ( Mount Ebal = the Jews ’ term for Gerizim ) . - 4:23 In Spirit and truth : not a reference to an interior worship within one ’ s own spirit . The Spirit is the spirit given by God that reveals truth and enables one to worship God appropriately ( Jn 14:16–17 ) . Cf . “ born of water and Spirit ” ( Jn 3:5 ) . - 4:25 The expectations of the Samaritans are expressed here in Jewish terminology . They did not expect a messianic king of the house of David but a prophet like Moses ( Dt 18:15 ) . - 4:26 I am he : it could also be translated “ I am , ” an Old Testament self-designation of Yahweh ( Is 43:3 , etc . ) ; cf . Jn 6:20 ; 8:24 ,

NABRE	John	5	3	In these lay a large number of ill , blind , lame , and crippled . [ d ] [
NABRE	John	5	4	] [ e ]
NABRE	John	5	6	When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been ill for a long time , he said to him , “ Do you want to be well ? ”
NABRE	John	5	7	The sick man answered him , “ Sir , I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up ; while I am on my way , someone else gets down there before me. ”
NABRE	John	5	8	Jesus said to him , “ Rise , take up your mat , and walk. ” ( C )
NABRE	John	5	9	Immediately the man became well , took up his mat , and walked . ( D ) Now that day was a sabbath .
NABRE	John	5	10	So the Jews said to the man who was cured , “ It is the sabbath , and it is not lawful for you to carry your mat. ” ( E )
NABRE	John	5	11	He answered them , “ The man who made me well told me , ‘ Take up your mat and walk. ’ ”
NABRE	John	5	12	They asked him , “ Who is the man who told you , ‘ Take it up and walk ’ ? ”
NABRE	John	5	13	The man who was healed did not know who it was , for Jesus had slipped away , since there was a crowd there . ( F )
NABRE	John	5	14	[ f ] After this Jesus found him in the temple area and said to him , ( G ) “ Look , you are well ; do not sin any more , so that nothing worse may happen to you. ”
NABRE	John	5	15	The man went and told the Jews that Jesus was the one who had made him well .
NABRE	John	5	16	Therefore , the Jews began to persecute Jesus because he did this on a sabbath . ( H )
NABRE	John	5	17	[ g ] But Jesus answered them , ( I ) “ My Father is at work until now , so I am at work. ”
NABRE	John	5	18	For this reason the Jews tried all the more to kill him , because he not only broke the sabbath but he also called God his own father , making himself equal to God . ( J ) The Work of the Son .
NABRE	John	5	19	[ h ] Jesus answered and said to them , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , a son can not do anything on his own , but only what he sees his father doing ; ( K ) for what he does , his son will do also .
NABRE	John	5	20	For the Father loves his Son and shows him everything that he himself does , and he will show him greater works than these , so that you may be amazed . ( L )
NABRE	John	5	21	For just as the Father raises the dead and gives life , [ i ] so also does the Son give life to whomever he wishes . ( M )
NABRE	John	5	22	Nor does the Father judge anyone , but he has given all judgment [ j ] to his Son , ( N )
NABRE	John	5	23	so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father . Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him .
NABRE	John	5	24	Amen , amen , I say to you , whoever hears my word and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life and will not come to condemnation , but has passed from death to life . ( O )
NABRE	John	5	25	Amen , amen , I say to you , the hour is coming and is now here when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God , and those who hear will live . ( P )
NABRE	John	5	26	For just as the Father has life in himself , so also he gave to his Son the possession of life in himself . ( Q )
NABRE	John	5	27	) . - 5:19 This proverb or parable is taken from apprenticeship in a trade : the activity of a son is modeled on that of his father . Jesus ’ dependence on the Father is justification for doing what the Father does . - 5:21 Gives life : in the Old Testament , a divine prerogative ( Dt 32:39 ;
NABRE	John	5	28	[ k ] Do not be amazed at this , because the hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice ( S )
NABRE	John	5	29	and will come out , those who have done good deeds to the resurrection of life , but those who have done wicked deeds to the resurrection of condemnation . ( T )
NABRE	John	5	30	“ I can not do anything on my own ; I judge as I hear , and my judgment is just , because I do not seek my own will but the will of the one who sent me . ( U ) Witnesses to Jesus .

NABRE	John	5	32	; 12:39 . Hebrew : more precisely , Aramaic . Bethesda : preferred to variants “ Be ( th ) zatha ” and “ Bethsaida ” ; bêt- ’ ešdatayīn is given as the name of a double pool northeast of the temple area in the Qumran Copper Roll . Five porticoes : a pool excavated in Jerusalem actually has five porticoes . - 5:3 The Caesarean and Western recensions , followed by the Vulgate , add “ waiting for the movement of the water. ” Apparently an intermittent spring in the pool bubbled up occasionally ( see Jn 5:7 ) . This turbulence was believed to cure . - 5:4 Toward the end of the second century in the West and among the fourth-century Greek Fathers , an additional verse was known : “ For [ from time to time ] an angel of the Lord used to come down into the pool ; and the water was stirred up , so the first one to get in [ after the stirring of the water ] was healed of whatever disease afflicted him. ” The angel was a popular explanation of the turbulence and the healing powers attributed to it . This verse is missing from all early Greek manuscripts and the earliest versions , including the original Vulgate . Its vocabulary is markedly non-Johannine . - 5:14 While the cure of the paralytic in Mk 2:1–12 is associated with the forgiveness of sins , Jesus never drew a one-to-one connection between sin and suffering ( cf . Jn 9:3 ; Lk 12:1–5 ) , as did Ez 18:20 . - 5:17 Sabbath observance ( Jn 5:10 ) was based on God ’ s resting on the seventh day ( cf . Gn 2:2–3 ; Ex 20:11 ) . Philo and some rabbis insisted that God ’ s providence remains active on the sabbath , keeping all things in existence , giving life in birth and taking it away in death . Other rabbis taught that God rested from creating , but not from judging ( = ruling , governing ) . Jesus here claims the same authority to work as the Father , and , in the discourse that follows , the same divine prerogatives : power over life and death ( Jn 5:21 , 24–26 ) and judgment ( Jn 5:22 ,

The connection of that feast with the giving of the law to Moses on Sinai , attested in later Judaism , may already have been made in the first century . The feast could also be Passover ( cf . Jn 6:4 ) . John stresses that the day was a sabbath ( Jn 5:9 ) . - 5:2 There is no noun with Sheep . “ Gate ” is supplied on the grounds that there must have been a gate in the NE wall of the temple area where animals for sacrifice were brought in ; cf .

There may thus be a break between Jn 6:50–51 . - 6:43 Murmuring : the word may reflect the Greek of Ex 16:2 , 7–8 . - 6:54–58 Eats : the verb used in these verses is not the classical Greek verb used of human eating , but that of animal eating : “ munch , ” “ gnaw. ” This may be part of John ’ s emphasis on the reality of the flesh and blood of Jesus ( cf . Jn 6:55 ) , but the same verb eventually became the ordinary verb in Greek meaning “ eat. ” - 6:60–71 These verses refer more to themes of Jn 6:35–50 than to those of Jn 6:51–58 and seem to be addressed to members of the Johannine community who found it difficult to accept the high christology reflected in the bread of life discourse . - 6:62 This unfinished conditional sentence is obscure . Probably there is a reference to Jn 6:49–51 . Jesus claims to be the bread that comes down from heaven ( Jn 6:50 ) ; this claim provokes incredulity ( Jn 6:60 ) ; and so Jesus is pictured as asking what his disciples will say when he goes up to heaven . - 6:63 Spirit…flesh : probably not a reference to the eucharistic body of Jesus but to the supernatural and the natural , as in Jn 3:6 .

NABRE	John	6	3	Jesus went up on the mountain , and there he sat down with his disciples .
NABRE	John	6	4	The Jewish feast of Passover was near . ( B )
NABRE	John	6	5	[ c ] When Jesus raised his eyes and saw that a large crowd was coming to him , he said to Philip , ( C ) “ Where can we buy enough food for them to eat ? ”
NABRE	John	6	7	Philip answered him , “ Two hundred days ’ wages [ e ] worth of food would not be enough for each of them to have a little [ bit ] . ” ( D )
NABRE	John	6	8	One of his disciples , Andrew , the brother of Simon Peter , said to him ,
NABRE	John	6	9	“ There is a boy here who has five barley loaves [ f ] and two fish ; but what good are these for so many ? ” ( E )
NABRE	John	6	10	Jesus said , “ Have the people recline. ” Now there was a great deal of grass [ g ] in that place . So the men reclined , about five thousand in number . ( F )
NABRE	John	6	11	Then Jesus took the loaves , gave thanks , and distributed them to those who were reclining , and also as much of the fish as they wanted . ( G )
NABRE	John	6	12	When they had had their fill , he said to his disciples , “ Gather the fragments left over , so that nothing will be wasted. ”
NABRE	John	6	13	So they collected them , and filled twelve wicker baskets [ h ] with fragments from the five barley loaves that had been more than they could eat .
NABRE	John	6	14	When the people saw the sign he had done , they said , “ This is truly the Prophet , [ i ] the one who is to come into the world. ” ( H )

NABRE	John	6	16	( J ) When it was evening , his disciples went down to the sea ,
NABRE	John	6	17	embarked in a boat , and went across the sea to Capernaum . It had already grown dark , and Jesus had not yet come to them .
NABRE	John	6	18	The sea was stirred up because a strong wind was blowing .
NABRE	John	6	19	When they had rowed about three or four miles , they saw Jesus walking on the sea [ k ] and coming near the boat , and they began to be afraid . ( K )
NABRE	John	6	20	But he said to them , “ It is I . [ l ] Do not be afraid. ”
NABRE	John	6	21	They wanted to take him into the boat , but the boat immediately arrived at the shore to which they were heading . The Bread of Life Discourse .
NABRE	John	6	22	[ m ] The next day , the crowd that remained across the sea saw that there had been only one boat there , and that Jesus had not gone along with his disciples in the boat , but only his disciples had left .
NABRE	John	6	23	. - 6:16–21 The fifth sign is a nature miracle , portraying Jesus sharing Yahweh ’ s power . Cf . the parallel stories following the multiplication of the loaves in Mk 6:45–52 and Mt 14:22–33 . - 6:19 Walking on the sea : although the Greek ( cf . Jn 6:16 ) could mean “ on the seashore ” or “ by the sea ” ( cf . Jn 21:1 ) , the parallels , especially Mt 14:25 , make clear that Jesus walked upon the water . John may allude to Jb 9:8 : God “ treads upon the crests of the sea. ” - 6:20 It is I : literally , “ I am. ” See also notes on Jn 4:26 and Mk 6:50 . - 6:22–71 Discourse on the bread of life ; replacement of the manna . Jn 6:22–34 serve as an introduction , Jn 6:35–59 constitute the discourse proper , Jn 6:60–71 portray the reaction of the disciples and Peter ’ s confession . - 6:23 Possibly a later interpolation , to explain how the crowd got to Capernaum . - 6:27 The food that endures for eternal life : cf . Jn 4:14 , on water “ springing up to eternal life. ” - 6:31 Bread from heaven : cf . Ex 16:4 ,
NABRE	John	6	24	When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there , they themselves got into boats and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus .
NABRE	John	6	25	And when they found him across the sea they said to him , “ Rabbi , when did you get here ? ”
NABRE	John	6	26	Jesus answered them and said , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , you are looking for me not because you saw signs but because you ate the loaves and were filled .
NABRE	John	6	27	Do not work for food that perishes but for the food that endures for eternal life , [ o ] which the Son of Man will give you . For on him the Father , God , has set his seal. ” ( L )
NABRE	John	6	28	So they said to him , “ What can we do to accomplish the works of God ? ”
NABRE	John	6	29	Jesus answered and said to them , “ This is the work of God , that you believe in the one he sent. ”
NABRE	John	6	30	So they said to him , “ What sign can you do , that we may see and believe in you ? What can you do ? ( M )
NABRE	John	6	31	[ p ] Our ancestors ate manna in the desert , as it is written : ( N ) ‘ He gave them bread from heaven to eat. ’ ”
NABRE	John	6	32	So Jesus said to them , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , it was not Moses who gave the bread from heaven ; my Father gives you the true bread from heaven . ( O )
NABRE	John	6	33	For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world. ”
NABRE	John	6	34	( P ) So they said to him , “ Sir , give us this bread always. ”
NABRE	John	6	35	[ q ] Jesus said to them , “ I am the bread of life ; whoever comes to me will never hunger , and whoever believes in me will never thirst . ( Q )
NABRE	John	6	36	But I told you that although you have seen [ me ] , you do not believe . ( R )
NABRE	John	6	37	Everything that the Father gives me will come to me , and I will not reject anyone who comes to me ,
NABRE	John	6	38	because I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the one who sent me . ( S )
NABRE	John	6	39	And this is the will of the one who sent me , that I should not lose anything of what he gave me , but that I should raise it [ on ] the last day . ( T )
NABRE	John	6	40	For this is the will of my Father , that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him may have eternal life , and I shall raise him [ on ] the last day. ” ( U )
NABRE	John	6	41	The Jews murmured about him because he said , “ I am the bread that came down from heaven , ”
NABRE	John	6	42	and they said , “ Is this not Jesus , the son of Joseph ? Do we not know his father and mother ? Then how can he say , ‘ I have come down from heaven ’ ? ” ( V )
NABRE	John	6	43	Jesus answered and said to them , “ Stop murmuring [ r ] among yourselves . ( W )
NABRE	John	6	44	and parallels . - 6:13 Baskets : the word describes the typically Palestinian wicker basket , as in Mk 6:43 and parallels . - 6:14 The Prophet : probably the prophet like Moses ( see note on Jn 1:21 ) . The one who is to come into the world : probably Elijah ; cf . Mal 3:1 ,
NABRE	John	6	45	It is written in the prophets : ‘ They shall all be taught by God. ’ Everyone who listens to my Father and learns from him comes to me . ( X )
NABRE	John	6	46	Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God ; he has seen the Father . ( Y )
NABRE	John	6	47	Amen , amen , I say to you , whoever believes has eternal life .
NABRE	John	6	48	I am the bread of life .
NABRE	John	6	49	Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert , but they died ; ( Z )
NABRE	John	6	50	this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat it and not die .
NABRE	John	6	51	I am the living bread that came down from heaven ; whoever eats this bread will live forever ; and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world. ” ( AA )
NABRE	John	6	52	The Jews quarreled among themselves , saying , “ How can this man give us [ his ] flesh to eat ? ”
NABRE	John	6	53	Jesus said to them , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you do not have life within you .
NABRE	John	6	54	Whoever eats [ s ] my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and I will raise him on the last day .
NABRE	John	6	55	For my flesh is true food , and my blood is true drink .
NABRE	John	6	56	Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him .
NABRE	John	6	57	Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father , so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me . ( AB )
NABRE	John	6	58	This is the bread that came down from heaven . Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died , whoever eats this bread will live forever. ”
NABRE	John	6	59	These things he said while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum . The Words of Eternal Life . [ t ]
NABRE	John	6	60	Then many of his disciples who were listening said , “ This saying is hard ; who can accept it ? ”
NABRE	John	6	61	Since Jesus knew that his disciples were murmuring about this , he said to them , “ Does this shock you ?
NABRE	John	6	62	What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before ? [ u ]
NABRE	John	6	63	It is the spirit that gives life , while the flesh [ v ] is of no avail . The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life .
NABRE	John	6	64	But there are some of you who do not believe. ” Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe and the one who would betray him . ( AC )
NABRE	John	6	65	And he said , “ For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father. ”
NABRE	John	6	66	As a result of this , many [ of ] his disciples returned to their former way of life and no longer accompanied him .
NABRE	John	6	67	Jesus then said to the Twelve , “ Do you also want to leave ? ”
NABRE	John	6	68	Simon Peter answered him , “ Master , to whom shall we go ? You have the words of eternal life .
NABRE	John	6	69	We have come to believe and are convinced that you are the Holy One of God. ” ( AD )
NABRE	John	6	70	Jesus answered them , “ Did I not choose you twelve ? Yet is not one of you a devil ? ”
NABRE	John	6	71	He was referring to Judas , son of Simon the Iscariot ; it was he who would betray him , one of the Twelve . ( AE ) Footnotes - 6:1–15 This story of the multiplication of the loaves is the fourth sign ( cf . note on Jn 5:1–47 ) . It is the only miracle story found in all four gospels ( occurring twice in Mark and Matthew ) . See notes on Mt 14:13–21 ; 15:32–39 . John differs on the roles of Philip and Andrew , the proximity of Passover ( Jn 6:4 ) , and the allusion to Elisha ( see Jn 6:9 ) . The story here symbolizes the food that is really available through Jesus . It connotes a new exodus and has eucharistic overtones . - 6:1 [ Of Tiberias ] : the awkward apposition represents a later name of the Sea of Galilee . It was probably originally a marginal gloss . - 6:5 Jesus takes the initiative ( in the synoptics , the disciples do ) , possibly pictured as ( cf . Jn 6:14 ) the new Moses ( cf . Nm 11:13 ) . - 6:6 Probably the evangelist ’ s comment ; in this gospel Jesus is never portrayed as ignorant of anything . - 6:7 Days ’ wages : literally , “ denarii ” ; a Roman denarius is a day ’ s wage in Mt 20:2 . - 6:9 Barley loaves : the food of the poor . There seems an allusion to the story of Elisha multiplying the barley bread in

NABRE	John	7	11	The Jews were looking for him at the feast and saying , “ Where is he ? ”
NABRE	John	7	12	And there was considerable murmuring about him in the crowds . Some said , “ He is a good man , ” [ while ] others said , “ No ; on the contrary , he misleads the crowd. ”
NABRE	John	7	13	,
NABRE	John	7	14	When the feast was already half over , Jesus went up into the temple area and began to teach .
NABRE	John	7	15	[ f ] ( F ) The Jews were amazed and said , “ How does he know scripture without having studied ? ”
NABRE	John	7	16	Jesus answered them and said , “ My teaching is not my own but is from the one who sent me .
NABRE	John	7	17	Whoever chooses to do his will [ g ] shall know whether my teaching is from God or whether I speak on my own . ( G )
NABRE	John	7	18	Whoever speaks on his own seeks his own glory , but whoever seeks the glory of the one who sent him is truthful , and there is no wrong in him .

NABRE	John	7	28	So Jesus cried out in the temple area as he was teaching and said , “ You know me and also know where I am from . Yet I did not come on my own , but the one who sent me , whom you do not know , is true . ( O )

NABRE	John	7	39	Promise of living water through the Spirit . - 7:38 Living water : not an exact quotation from any Old Testament passage ; in the gospel context the gift of the Spirit is meant ; cf . Jn 3:5 . From within him : either Jesus or the believer ; if Jesus , it continues the Jesus-Moses motif ( water from the rock , Ex 17:6 ; Nm 20:11 ) as well as Jesus as the new temple ( cf . Ez 47:1 ) . Grammatically , it goes better with the believer . - 7:39 No Spirit yet : Codex Vaticanus and early Latin , Syriac , and Coptic versions add “ given. ” In this gospel , the sending of the Spirit can not take place until Jesus ’ glorification through his death , resurrection , and ascension ; cf . Jn 20:22 . - 7:40–53 Discussion of the Davidic lineage of the Messiah . - 7:53–8:11 The story of the woman caught in adultery is a later insertion here , missing from all early Greek manuscripts . A Western text-type insertion , attested mainly in Old Latin translations , it is found in different places in different manuscripts : here , or after Jn 7:36 or at the end of this gospel , or after Lk 21:38 , or at the end of that gospel . There are many non-Johannine features in the language , and there are also many doubtful readings within the passage . The style and motifs are similar to those of Luke , and it fits better with the general situation at the end of Lk

NABRE	John	7	43	So a division occurred in the crowd because of him .

NABRE	John	7	45	So the guards went to the chief priests and Pharisees , who asked them , “ Why did you not bring him ? ”
NABRE	John	7	46	The guards answered , “ Never before has anyone spoken like this one. ”

They continue the theme of the replacement of feasts ( Passover , Jn 2:13 ; 6:4 ; Hanukkah , Jn 10:22 ; Pentecost , Jn 5:1 ) , here accomplished by Jesus as the Living Water . These chapters comprise seven miscellaneous controversies and dialogues . There is a literary inclusion with Jesus in hiding in Jn 7:4 ,
NABRE	John	7	59	. - 7:3 Brothers : these relatives ( cf . Jn 2:12 and see note on Mk 6:3 ) are never portrayed as disciples until after the resurrection ( Acts 1:14 ) . Mt 13:55 and Mk 6:3 give the names of four of them . Jesus has already performed works/signs in Judea ; cf . Jn 2:23 ; 3:2 ; 4:45 ; 5:8 . - 7:6 Time : the Greek word means “ opportune time , ” here a synonym for Jesus ’ “ hour ” ( see note on Jn 2:4 ) , his death and resurrection . In the wordplay , any time is suitable for Jesus ’ brothers , because they are not dependent on God ’ s will . - 7:8 I am not going up : an early attested reading “ not yet ” seems a correction , since Jesus in the story does go up to the feast . “ Go up , ” in a play on words , refers not only to going up to Jerusalem but also to exaltation at the cross , resurrection , and ascension ; cf . Jn 3:14 ; 6:62 ; 20:17 . - 7:14–31 Jesus teaches in the temple ; debate with the Jews . - 7:15 Without having studied : literally , “ How does he know letters without having learned ? ” Children were taught to read and write by means of the scriptures . But here more than Jesus ’ literacy is being discussed ; the people are wondering how he can teach like a rabbi . Rabbis were trained by other rabbis and traditionally quoted their teachers . - 7:17 To do his will : presumably a reference back to the “ work ” of Jn 6:29 : belief in the one whom God has sent . - 7:20 You are possessed : literally , “ You have a demon. ” The insane were thought to be possessed by a demoniacal spirit . - 7:21 One work : the cure of the paralytic ( Jn 5:1–9 ) because of the reference to the sabbath ( Jn 7:22 ; 5:9–10 ) . - 7:26 The authorities : the members of the Sanhedrin ( same term as Jn 3:1 ) . - 7:32–36 Jesus announces his approaching departure ( cf . also Jn 8:21 ; 12:36 ; 13:33 ) and complete control over his destiny . - 7:35 Dispersion : or “ diaspora ” : Jews living outside Palestine . Greeks : probably refers to the Gentiles in the Mediterranean area ; cf . Jn 12:20 . - 7:37 ,

NABRE	John	8	2	But early in the morning he arrived again in the temple area , and all the people started coming to him , and he sat down and taught them .
NABRE	John	8	3	Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and made her stand in the middle .
NABRE	John	8	4	They said to him , “ Teacher , this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery .
NABRE	John	8	5	Now in the law , Moses commanded us to stone such women . [ c ] So what do you say ? ” ( B )
NABRE	John	8	6	They said this to test him , so that they could have some charge to bring against him . Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with his finger . [ d ]
NABRE	John	8	7	[ e ] But when they continued asking him , he straightened up and said to them , ( C ) “ Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her. ”
NABRE	John	8	9	And in response , they went away one by one , beginning with the elders . So he was left alone with the woman before him .
NABRE	John	8	10	Then Jesus straightened up and said to her , “ Woman , where are they ? Has no one condemned you ? ” ( D )
NABRE	John	8	11	She replied , “ No one , sir. ” Then Jesus said , “ Neither do I condemn you . Go , [ and ] from now on do not sin any more. ” ] ( E ) The Light of the World . [ f ]
NABRE	John	8	12	Jesus spoke to them again , saying , “ I am the light of the world . Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness , but will have the light of life. ” ( F )
NABRE	John	8	13	So the Pharisees said to him , “ You testify on your own behalf , so your testimony can not be verified. ”
NABRE	John	8	14	Jesus answered and said to them , “ Even if I do testify on my own behalf , my testimony can be verified , [ g ] because I know where I came from and where I am going . But you do not know where I come from or where I am going . ( G )
NABRE	John	8	15	You judge by appearances , [ h ] but I do not judge anyone . ( H )
NABRE	John	8	16	;
NABRE	John	8	17	Even in your law [ i ] it is written that the testimony of two men can be verified . ( J )
NABRE	John	8	18	I testify on my behalf and so does the Father who sent me. ” ( K )
NABRE	John	8	19	So they said to him , “ Where is your father ? ” Jesus answered , “ You know neither me nor my Father . If you knew me , you would know my Father also. ” ( L )
NABRE	John	8	20	He spoke these words while teaching in the treasury in the temple area . But no one arrested him , because his hour had not yet come . ( M ) Jesus , the Father ’ s Ambassador . [ j ]

It is also possible , however , to understand the second part of the verse as a sarcastic reference to descent of the Jews from the devil ( Jn 8:44 ) , “ You do what you have heard from [ your ] father. ” - 8:39 The works of Abraham : Abraham believed ; cf . Rom 4:11–17 ; Jas 2:21–23 . - 8:48 Samaritan : therefore interested in magical powers ; cf . Acts 7:14–24 . - 8:53 Are you greater than our father Abraham ? : cf . Jn 4:12 . - 8:56 He saw it : this seems a reference to the birth of Isaac ( Gn 17:7 ; 21:6 ) , the beginning of the fulfillment of promises about Abraham ’ s seed . - 8:57 The evidence of the third-century Bodmer Papyrus P75 and the first hand of Codex Sinaiticus indicates that the text originally read : “ How can Abraham have seen you ? ” - 8:58 Came to be , I AM : the Greek word used for “ came to be ” is the one used of all creation in the prologue , while the word used for “ am ” is the one reserved for the Logos .

NABRE	John	8	22	[ l ] So the Jews said , “ He is not going to kill himself , is he , because he said , ‘ Where I am going you can not come ’ ? ”
NABRE	John	8	23	He said to them , “ You belong to what is below , I belong to what is above . You belong to this world , but I do not belong to this world . ( O )
NABRE	John	8	24	That is why I told you that you will die in your sins . For if you do not believe that I AM , [ m ] you will die in your sins. ” ( P )
NABRE	John	8	25	[ n ] So they said to him , “ Who are you ? ” ( Q ) Jesus said to them , “ What I told you from the beginning .
NABRE	John	8	26	I have much to say about you in condemnation . But the one who sent me is true , and what I heard from him I tell the world. ” ( R )
NABRE	John	8	27	,
NABRE	John	8	28	I AM : an expression that late Jewish tradition understood as Yahweh ’ s own self-designation ( Is 43:10 ) ; see note on Jn 4:26 . Jesus is here placed on a par with Yahweh . - 8:25 What I told you from the beginning : this verse seems textually corrupt , with several other possible translations : “ ( I am ) what I say to you ” ; “ Why do I speak to you at all ? ” The earliest attested reading ( Bodmer Papyrus P66 ) has ( in a second hand ) , “ I told you at the beginning what I am also telling you ( now ) . ” The answer here ( cf . Prv 8:22 ) seems to hinge on a misunderstanding of Jn 8:24 “ that I AM ” as “ what I am. ” - 8:31–59 Jesus ’ origin ( “ before Abraham ” ) and destiny are developed ; the truth will free them from sin ( Jn 8:34 ) and death ( Jn 8:51 ) . - 8:31 Those Jews who believed in him : a rough editorial suture , since in Jn 8:37 they are described as trying to kill Jesus . - 8:33 Have never been enslaved to anyone : since , historically , the Jews were enslaved almost continuously , this verse is probably Johannine irony , about slavery to sin . - 8:35 A slave…a son : an allusion to Ishmael and Isaac ( Gn
NABRE	John	8	29	The one who sent me is with me . He has not left me alone , because I always do what is pleasing to him. ”
NABRE	John	8	30	; here the emphasis is that the judgment is not by material standards . - 8:17 Your law : a reflection of later controversy between church and synagogue . - 8:21–30 He whose ambassador I am is with me . Jesus ’ origin is from God ; he can reveal God . - 8:21 You will die in your sin : i.e. , of disbelief ; cf . Jn 8:24 . Where I am going you can not come : except through faith in Jesus ’ passion-resurrection . - 8:22 The Jews suspect that he is referring to his death . Johannine irony is apparent here ; Jesus ’ death will not be self-inflicted but destined by God . - 8:24 ,
NABRE	John	8	31	Jesus then said to those Jews who believed in him , [ p ] “ If you remain in my word , you will truly be my disciples ,
NABRE	John	8	32	and you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free. ” ( T )
NABRE	John	8	33	They answered him , “ We are descendants of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone . [ q ] How can you say , ‘ You will become free ’ ? ” ( U )
NABRE	John	8	34	Jesus answered them , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin . ( V )
NABRE	John	8	35	A slave does not remain in a household forever , but a son [ r ] always remains . ( W )
NABRE	John	8	36	So if a son frees you , then you will truly be free .
NABRE	John	8	37	I know that you are descendants of Abraham . But you are trying to kill me , because my word has no room among you .
NABRE	John	8	38	[ s ] I tell you what I have seen in the Father ’ s presence ; then do what you have heard from the Father. ”
NABRE	John	8	39	[ t ] They answered and said to him , “ Our father is Abraham. ” Jesus said to them , ( X ) “ If you were Abraham ’ s children , you would be doing the works of Abraham .
NABRE	John	8	40	But now you are trying to kill me , a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God ; Abraham did not do this .
NABRE	John	8	41	You are doing the works of your father ! ” [ So ] they said to him , “ We are not illegitimate . We have one Father , God. ” ( Y )
NABRE	John	8	42	Jesus said to them , “ If God were your Father , you would love me , for I came from God and am here ; I did not come on my own , but he sent me . ( Z )
NABRE	John	8	43	Why do you not understand what I am saying ? Because you can not bear to hear my word .
NABRE	John	8	44	You belong to your father the devil and you willingly carry out your father ’ s desires . He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in truth , because there is no truth in him . When he tells a lie , he speaks in character , because he is a liar and the father of lies . ( AA )
NABRE	John	8	45	But because I speak the truth , you do not believe me .
NABRE	John	8	46	Can any of you charge me with sin ? If I am telling the truth , why do you not believe me ? ( AB )
NABRE	John	8	47	Whoever belongs to God hears the words of God ; for this reason you do not listen , because you do not belong to God. ” ( AC )
NABRE	John	8	48	The Jews answered and said to him , “ Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan [ u ] and are possessed ? ”
NABRE	John	8	49	Jesus answered , “ I am not possessed ; I honor my Father , but you dishonor me .
NABRE	John	8	50	I do not seek my own glory ; there is one who seeks it and he is the one who judges . ( AD )
NABRE	John	8	51	Amen , amen , I say to you , whoever keeps my word will never see death. ” ( AE )
NABRE	John	8	52	[ So ] the Jews said to him , “ Now we are sure that you are possessed . Abraham died , as did the prophets , yet you say , ‘ Whoever keeps my word will never taste death. ’
NABRE	John	8	54	Jesus answered , “ If I glorify myself , my glory is worth nothing ; but it is my Father who glorifies me , of whom you say , ‘ He is our God. ’
NABRE	John	8	55	You do not know him , but I know him . And if I should say that I do not know him , I would be like you a liar . But I do know him and I keep his word . ( AG )
NABRE	John	8	56	Abraham your father rejoiced to see my day ; he saw it [ w ] and was glad . ( AH )
NABRE	John	8	57	So the Jews said to him , “ You are not yet fifty years old and you have seen Abraham ? ” [ x ]
NABRE	John	8	58	[ y ] Jesus said to them , ( AI ) “ Amen , amen , I say to you , before Abraham came to be , I AM. ”
NABRE	John	8	59	So they picked up stones to throw at him ; but Jesus hid and went out of the temple area . ( AJ ) Footnotes - 7:53–8:11 The story of the woman caught in adultery is a later insertion here , missing from all early Greek manuscripts . A Western text-type insertion , attested mainly in Old Latin translations , it is found in different places in different manuscripts : here , or after Jn 7:36 or at the end of this gospel , or after Lk 21:38 , or at the end of that gospel . There are many non-Johannine features in the language , and there are also many doubtful readings within the passage .

Tb 7:7 ; 11:7–13 ; 14:1–2 ) , but Tobit was not born blind . - 9:39–41 These verses spell out the symbolic meaning of the cure ; the Pharisees are not the innocent blind , willing to accept the testimony of others .

NABRE	John	9	2	Kgs 5:10–14 . The water tunnel Siloam ( = Sent ) is used as a symbol of Jesus , sent by his Father . - 9:14 In using spittle , kneading clay , and healing , Jesus had broken the sabbath rules laid down by Jewish tradition . - 9:22 This comment of the evangelist ( in terms used again in Jn 12:42 ; 16:2 ) envisages a situation after Jesus ’ ministry . Rejection/excommunication from the synagogue of Jews who confessed Jesus as Messiah seems to have begun ca . A.D.
NABRE	John	9	3	Jesus answered , “ Neither he nor his parents sinned ; it is so that the works of God might be made visible through him . ( C )
NABRE	John	9	4	We have to do the works of the one who sent me while it is day . Night is coming when no one can work . ( D )
NABRE	John	9	5	While I am in the world , I am the light of the world. ” ( E )
NABRE	John	9	6	When he had said this , he spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva , and smeared the clay on his eyes , ( F )
NABRE	John	9	7	and said to him , “ Go wash [ c ] in the Pool of Siloam ” ( which means Sent ) . So he went and washed , and came back able to see . ( G )
NABRE	John	9	8	His neighbors and those who had seen him earlier as a beggar said , “ Isn ’ t this the one who used to sit and beg ? ”
NABRE	John	9	10	So they said to him , “ [ So ] how were your eyes opened ? ”
NABRE	John	9	11	He replied , “ The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and told me , ‘ Go to Siloam and wash. ’ So I went there and washed and was able to see. ”
NABRE	John	9	12	And they said to him , “ Where is he ? ” He said , “ I don ’ t know. ”
NABRE	John	9	13	They brought the one who was once blind to the Pharisees .
NABRE	John	9	14	Now Jesus had made clay [ d ] and opened his eyes on a sabbath . ( H )
NABRE	John	9	15	So then the Pharisees also asked him how he was able to see . He said to them , “ He put clay on my eyes , and I washed , and now I can see. ”
NABRE	John	9	16	So some of the Pharisees said , “ This man is not from God , because he does not keep the sabbath. ” [ But ] others said , “ How can a sinful man do such signs ? ” And there was a division among them . ( I )
NABRE	John	9	17	So they said to the blind man again , “ What do you have to say about him , since he opened your eyes ? ” He said , “ He is a prophet. ” ( J )
NABRE	John	9	18	Now the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and gained his sight until they summoned the parents of the one who had gained his sight .
NABRE	John	9	19	They asked them , “ Is this your son , who you say was born blind ? How does he now see ? ”
NABRE	John	9	20	His parents answered and said , “ We know that this is our son and that he was born blind .
NABRE	John	9	21	We do not know how he sees now , nor do we know who opened his eyes . Ask him , he is of age ; he can speak for himself. ”
NABRE	John	9	22	[ e ] ( K ) His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews , for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone acknowledged him as the Messiah , he would be expelled from the synagogue .
NABRE	John	9	23	For this reason his parents said , “ He is of age ; question him. ” ( L )
NABRE	John	9	24	So a second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him , “ Give God the praise ! [ f ] We know that this man is a sinner. ” ( M )
NABRE	John	9	25	He replied , “ If he is a sinner , I do not know . One thing I do know is that I was blind and now I see. ”
NABRE	John	9	26	So they said to him , “ What did he do to you ? How did he open your eyes ? ”
NABRE	John	9	27	He answered them , “ I told you already and you did not listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you want to become his disciples , too ? ”
NABRE	John	9	28	They ridiculed him and said , “ You are that man ’ s disciple ; we are disciples of Moses !
NABRE	John	9	29	We know that God spoke to Moses , but we do not know where this one is from. ” ( N )
NABRE	John	9	30	The man answered and said to them , “ This is what is so amazing , that you do not know where he is from , yet he opened my eyes .
NABRE	John	9	31	We know that God does not listen to sinners , but if one is devout and does his will , he listens to him . ( O )
NABRE	John	9	32	[ g ] It is unheard of that anyone ever opened the eyes of a person born blind .
NABRE	John	9	33	If this man were not from God , he would not be able to do anything. ” ( P )
NABRE	John	9	34	They answered and said to him , “ You were born totally in sin , and are you trying to teach us ? ” Then they threw him out .
NABRE	John	9	35	When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out , he found him and said , “ Do you believe in the Son of Man ? ”
NABRE	John	9	36	He answered and said , “ Who is he , sir , that I may believe in him ? ”
NABRE	John	9	37	Jesus said to him , “ You have seen him and the one speaking with you is he. ” ( Q )
NABRE	John	9	38	He said , “ I do believe , Lord , ” and he worshiped him .
NABRE	John	9	39	[ h ] Then Jesus said , “ I came into this world for judgment , so that those who do not see might see , and those who do see might become blind. ” ( R )
NABRE	John	9	40	Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and said to him , “ Surely we are not also blind , are we ? ” ( S )
NABRE	John	9	41	Jesus said to them , “ If you were blind , you would have no sin ; but now you are saying , ‘ We see , ’ so your sin remains . ( T ) Footnotes - 9:1–10:21 Sabbath healing of the man born blind . This sixth sign is introduced to illustrate the saying , “ I am the light of the world ” ( Jn 8:12 ; 9:5 ) . The narrative of conflict about Jesus contrasts Jesus ( light ) with the Jews ( blindness , Jn 9:39–41 ) . The theme of water is reintroduced in the reference to the pool of Siloam . Ironically , Jesus is being judged by the Jews , yet the Jews are judged by the Light of the world ; cf . Jn 3:19–21 . - 9:2 See note on Jn 5:14 , and Ex 20:5 , that parents ’ sins were visited upon their children . Jesus denies such a cause and emphasizes the purpose : the infirmity was providential . - 9:7 Go wash : perhaps a test of faith ; cf .

Jn 11:48–50 . If you are the Messiah , tell us plainly : cf . Lk 22:67 . This is the climax of Jesus ’ encounters with the Jewish authorities . There has never yet been an open confession before them . - 10:25 I told you : probably at Jn 8:25 which was an evasive answer . - 10:29 The textual evidence for the first clause is very divided ; it may also be translated : “ As for the Father , what he has given me is greater than all , ” or “ My Father is greater than all , in what he has given me. ” - 10:30 This is justification for Jn 10:29 ; it asserts unity of power and reveals that the words and deeds of Jesus are the words and deeds of God . - 10:34 This is a reference to the judges of Israel who , since they exercised the divine prerogative to judge ( Dt 1:17 ) , were called “ gods ” ; cf . Ex 21:6 , besides Ps 82:6 , from which the quotation comes . - 10:36 Consecrated : this may be a reference to the rededicated altar at the Hanukkah feast ; see note on Jn 10:22 . - 10:41 Performed no sign : this is to stress the inferior role of John the Baptist .

NABRE	John	10	3	The gatekeeper opens it for him , and the sheep hear his voice , as he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out .
NABRE	John	10	4	[ c ] When he has driven out all his own , he walks ahead of them , and the sheep follow him , ( B ) because they recognize his voice .
NABRE	John	10	5	But they will not follow a stranger ; they will run away from him , because they do not recognize the voice of strangers. ”
NABRE	John	10	6	Although Jesus used this figure of speech , [ d ] they did not realize what he was trying to tell them .
NABRE	John	10	7	[ e ] So Jesus said again , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , I am the gate for the sheep .
NABRE	John	10	8	[ f ] All who came [ before me ] are thieves and robbers , but the sheep did not listen to them .
NABRE	John	10	9	. For the shepherd motif , used of Yahweh in the Old Testament , cf . Ex
NABRE	John	10	11	I am the good shepherd . A good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep . ( C )
NABRE	John	10	12	A hired man , who is not a shepherd and whose sheep are not his own , sees a wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away , and the wolf catches and scatters them . ( D )
NABRE	John	10	13	This is because he works for pay and has no concern for the sheep .
NABRE	John	10	14	I am the good shepherd , and I know mine and mine know me ,
NABRE	John	10	15	just as the Father knows me and I know the Father ; and I will lay down my life for the sheep . ( E )
NABRE	John	10	16	I have other sheep [ g ] that do not belong to this fold . These also I must lead , and they will hear my voice , and there will be one flock , one shepherd . ( F )
NABRE	John	10	17	This is why the Father loves me , because I lay down my life in order to take it up again . ( G )
NABRE	John	10	18	No one takes it from me , but I lay it down on my own . I have power to lay it down , and power to take it up again . [ h ] This command I have received from my Father. ” ( H )
NABRE	John	10	19	Again there was a division among the Jews because of these words . ( I )
NABRE	John	10	20	Many of them said , “ He is possessed and out of his mind ; why listen to him ? ” ( J )

NABRE	John	10	24	So the Jews gathered around him and said to him , “ How long are you going to keep us in suspense ? [ k ] If you are the Messiah , tell us plainly. ” ( M )
NABRE	John	10	25	Jesus answered them , “ I told you [ l ] and you do not believe . The works I do in my Father ’ s name testify to me . ( N )

NABRE	John	10	39	[ Then ] they tried again to arrest him ; but he escaped from their power .
NABRE	John	10	40	He went back across the Jordan to the place where John first baptized , and there he remained . ( X )

NABRE	John	11	11	He said this , and then told them , “ Our friend Lazarus is asleep , but I am going to awaken him. ”
NABRE	John	11	1	Now a man was ill , Lazarus from Bethany , ( A ) the village of Mary and her sister Martha .
NABRE	John	11	2	Chr 30:1–3 , 15–18 . Scripture texts , prefaces , introductions , footnotes and cross references used in this work are taken from the New American Bible , revised edition ©
NABRE	John	11	3	So the sisters sent word to him , saying , “ Master , the one you love is ill. ”
NABRE	John	11	4	When Jesus heard this he said , “ This illness is not to end in death , [ b ] but is for the glory of God , that the Son of God may be glorified through it. ” ( B )
NABRE	John	11	5	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus .
NABRE	John	11	6	So when he heard that he was ill , he remained for two days in the place where he was .
NABRE	John	11	7	Then after this he said to his disciples , “ Let us go back to Judea. ”
NABRE	John	11	8	The disciples said to him , “ Rabbi , the Jews were just trying to stone you , and you want to go back there ? ” ( C )
NABRE	John	11	9	Jesus answered , “ Are there not twelve hours in a day ? If one walks during the day , ( D ) he does not stumble , because he sees the light of this world . ( E )
NABRE	John	11	10	But if one walks at night , he stumbles , because the light is not in him. ” [ c ]
NABRE	John	11	12	So the disciples said to him , “ Master , if he is asleep , he will be saved. ”
NABRE	John	11	13	But Jesus was talking about his death , while they thought that he meant ordinary sleep . ( F )
NABRE	John	11	14	So then Jesus said to them clearly , “ Lazarus has died .
NABRE	John	11	15	; Nm 9:6–14 ;
NABRE	John	11	16	So Thomas , called Didymus , [ d ] said to his fellow disciples , “ Let us also go to die with him. ” ( G )
NABRE	John	11	17	When Jesus arrived , he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days .
NABRE	John	11	18	Now Bethany was near Jerusalem , only about two miles [ e ] away .
NABRE	John	11	19	And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them about their brother . ( H )
NABRE	John	11	20	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming , she went to meet him ; but Mary sat at home .
NABRE	John	11	21	Martha said to Jesus , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died . ( I )
NABRE	John	11	22	[ But ] even now I know that whatever you ask of God , God will give you. ”
NABRE	John	11	23	Jesus said to her , “ Your brother will rise. ”
NABRE	John	11	24	Martha said to him , “ I know he will rise , in the resurrection on the last day. ” ( J )
NABRE	John	11	25	Jesus told her , “ I am the resurrection and the life ; whoever believes in me , even if he dies , will live , ( K )
NABRE	John	11	26	and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die . Do you believe this ? ”
NABRE	John	11	27	[ f ] ( L ) She said to him , “ Yes , Lord . I have come to believe that you are the Messiah , the Son of God , the one who is coming into the world. ”
NABRE	John	11	28	When she had said this , she went and called her sister Mary secretly , saying , “ The teacher is here and is asking for you. ”
NABRE	John	11	29	As soon as she heard this , she rose quickly and went to him .
NABRE	John	11	30	For Jesus had not yet come into the village , but was still where Martha had met him .
NABRE	John	11	31	So when the Jews who were with her in the house comforting her saw Mary get up quickly and go out , they followed her , presuming that she was going to the tomb to weep there .
NABRE	John	11	32	When Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him , she fell at his feet and said to him , “ Lord , if you had been here , my brother would not have died. ”
NABRE	John	11	33	When Jesus saw her weeping and the Jews who had come with her weeping , he became perturbed [ g ] and deeply troubled ,
NABRE	John	11	34	and said , “ Where have you laid him ? ” They said to him , “ Sir , come and see. ”
NABRE	John	11	35	And Jesus wept . ( M )
NABRE	John	11	36	So the Jews said , “ See how he loved him. ”
NABRE	John	11	37	But some of them said , “ Could not the one who opened the eyes of the blind man have done something so that this man would not have died ? ”
NABRE	John	11	38	So Jesus , perturbed again , came to the tomb . It was a cave , and a stone lay across it .
NABRE	John	11	39	Jesus said , “ Take away the stone. ” Martha , the dead man ’ s sister , said to him , “ Lord , by now there will be a stench ; he has been dead for four days. ”
NABRE	John	11	40	Jesus said to her , “ Did I not tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of God ? ”
NABRE	John	11	41	So they took away the stone . And Jesus raised his eyes and said , “ Father , [ h ] I thank you for hearing me .
NABRE	John	11	42	I know that you always hear me ; but because of the crowd here I have said this , that they may believe that you sent me. ” ( N )
NABRE	John	11	43	And when he had said this , he cried out in a loud voice , [ i ] “ Lazarus , come out ! ”
NABRE	John	11	44	The dead man came out , tied hand and foot with burial bands , and his face was wrapped in a cloth . So Jesus said to them , “ Untie him and let him go. ” Session of the Sanhedrin .
NABRE	John	11	45	Now many of the Jews who had come to Mary and seen what he had done began to believe in him . ( O )
NABRE	John	11	46	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done .
NABRE	John	11	47	So the chief priests and the Pharisees convened the Sanhedrin and said , “ What are we going to do ? This man is performing many signs . ( P )
NABRE	John	11	48	If we leave him alone , all will believe in him , and the Romans will come [ j ] and take away both our land and our nation. ”
NABRE	John	11	49	( Q ) But one of them , Caiaphas , who was high priest that year , [ k ] said to them , “ You know nothing ,
NABRE	John	11	50	nor do you consider that it is better for you that one man should die instead of the people , so that the whole nation may not perish. ”
NABRE	John	11	51	He did not say this on his own , but since he was high priest for that year , he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation ,
NABRE	John	11	52	and not only for the nation , but also to gather into one the dispersed children of God . [ l ]
NABRE	John	11	53	So from that day on they planned to kill him . ( R )
NABRE	John	11	54	So Jesus no longer walked about in public among the Jews , but he left for the region near the desert , to a town called Ephraim , [ m ] and there he remained with his disciples . The Last Passover .
NABRE	John	11	55	Now the Passover of the Jews was near , and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before Passover to purify [ n ] themselves . ( S )
NABRE	John	11	56	They looked for Jesus and said to one another as they were in the temple area , “ What do you think ? That he will not come to the feast ? ”
NABRE	John	11	57	For the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was , he should inform them , so that they might arrest him . Footnotes - 11:1–44 The raising of Lazarus , the longest continuous narrative in John outside of the passion account , is the climax of the signs . It leads directly to the decision of the Sanhedrin to kill Jesus . The theme of life predominates . Lazarus is a token of the real life that Jesus dead and raised will give to all who believe in him . Johannine irony is found in the fact that Jesus ’ gift of life leads to his own death . The story is not found in the synoptics , but cf . Mk 5:21 and parallels ; Lk 7:11–17 . There are also parallels between this story and Luke ’ s parable of the rich man and poor Lazarus ( Lk 16:19–31 ) . In both a man named Lazarus dies ; in Luke , there is a request that he return to convince his contemporaries of the need for faith and repentance , while in John , Lazarus does return and some believe but others do not . - 11:4 Not to end in death : this is misunderstood by the disciples as referring to physical death , but it is meant as spiritual death . - 11:10 The light is not in him : the ancients apparently did not grasp clearly the entry of light through the eye ; they seem to have thought of it as being in the eye ; cf . Lk 11:34 ; Mt 6:23 . - 11:16 Called Didymus : Didymus is the Greek word for twin . Thomas is derived from the Aramaic word for twin ; in an ancient Syriac version and in the Gospel of Thomas ( 80:11–12 ) his given name , Judas , is supplied . - 11:18 About two miles : literally , “ about fifteen stades ” ; a stade was
NABRE	John	11	607	feet . - 11:27 The titles here are a summary of titles given to Jesus earlier in the gospel . - 11:33 Became perturbed : a startling phrase in Greek , literally , “ He snorted in spirit , ” perhaps in anger at the presence of evil ( death ) . - 11:41 Father : in Aramaic , ’ abbā ’ . See note on Mk 14:36 . - 11:43 Cried out in a loud voice : a dramatization of Jn 5:28 ; “ the hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice. ” - 11:48 The Romans will come : Johannine irony ; this is precisely what happened after Jesus ’ death . - 11:49 That year : emphasizes the conjunction of the office and the year . Actually , Caiaphas was high priest A.D. 18–36 . The Jews attributed a gift of prophecy , sometimes unconscious , to the high priest . - 11:52 Dispersed children of God : perhaps the “ other sheep ” of Jn 10:16 . - 11:54 Ephraim is usually located about twelve miles northeast of Jerusalem , where the mountains descend into the Jordan valley . - 11:55 Purify : prescriptions for purity were based on Ex 19:10–11 ,

NABRE	John	12	12	( I ) On the next day , when the great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
NABRE	John	12	1	Mc 13:51 ;
NABRE	John	12	2	Mc 10:7 . They may be related to the lûlāb , the twig bundles used at the feast of Tabernacles . Hosanna : see Ps 118:25–26 . The Hebrew word means : “ ( O Lord ) , grant salvation. ” He who comes in the name of the Lord : referred in Ps 118:26 to a pilgrim entering the temple gates , but here a title for Jesus ( see notes on Mt 11:3 and Jn 6:14 ; 11:27 ) . The king of Israel : perhaps from Zep 3:14–15 , in connection with the next quotation from Zec 9:9 . - 12:15 Daughter Zion : Jerusalem . Ass ’ s colt : symbol of peace , as opposed to the war horse . - 12:16 They had done this : the antecedent of they is ambiguous . - 12:17–18 There seem to be two different crowds in these verses . There are some good witnesses to the text that have another reading for Jn 12:17 : “ Then the crowd that was with him began to testify that he had called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead. ” - 12:19 The whole world : the sense is that everyone is following Jesus , but John has an ironic play on world ; he alludes to the universality of salvation ( Jn 3:17 ; 4:42 ) . - 12:20–36 This announcement of glorification by death is an illustration of “ the whole world ” ( Jn 12:19 ) going after him . - 12:20 Greeks : not used here in a nationalistic sense . These are probably Gentile proselytes to Judaism ; cf . Jn 7:35 . - 12:21–22 Philip…Andrew : the approach is made through disciples who have distinctly Greek names , suggesting that access to Jesus was mediated to the Greek world through his disciples . Philip and Andrew were from Bethsaida ( Jn 1:44 ) ; Galileans were mostly bilingual . See : here seems to mean “ have an interview with. ” - 12:23 Jesus ’ response suggests that only after the crucifixion could the gospel encompass both Jew and Gentile . - 12:24 This verse implies that through his death Jesus will be accessible to all . It remains just a grain of wheat : this saying is found in the synoptic triple and double traditions ( Mk 8:35 ; Mt 16:25 ; Lk 9:24 ; Mt 10:39 ; Lk 17:33 ) . John adds the phrases ( Jn 12:25 ) in this world and for eternal life . - 12:25 His life : the Greek word psychē refers to a person ’ s natural life . It does not mean “ soul , ” for Hebrew anthropology did not postulate body/soul dualism in the way that is familiar to us . - 12:27 I am troubled : perhaps an allusion to the Gethsemane agony scene of the synoptics . - 12:31 Ruler of this world : Satan . - 12:34 There is no passage in the Old Testament that states precisely that the Messiah remains forever . Perhaps the closest is Ps 89:37 . - 12:37–50 These verses , on unbelief of the Jews , provide an epilogue to the Book of Signs . - 12:38–41 John gives a historical explanation of the disbelief of the Jewish people , not a psychological one . The Old Testament had to be fulfilled ; the disbelief that met Isaiah ’ s message was a foreshadowing of the disbelief that Jesus encountered . In Jn 12:42 and also in Jn 3:20 we see that there is no negation of freedom . - 12:41 His glory : Isaiah saw the glory of Yahweh enthroned in the heavenly temple , but in John the antecedent of his is Jesus .

NABRE	John	12	3	Mary took a liter of costly perfumed oil made from genuine aromatic nard and anointed the feet of Jesus [ b ] and dried them with her hair ; the house was filled with the fragrance of the oil . ( D )
NABRE	John	12	4	Then Judas the Iscariot , one [ of ] his disciples , and the one who would betray him , said ,
NABRE	John	12	5	“ Why was this oil not sold for three hundred days ’ wages [ c ] and given to the poor ? ”
NABRE	John	12	6	He said this not because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief and held the money bag and used to steal the contributions . ( E )
NABRE	John	12	7	So Jesus said , “ Leave her alone . Let her keep this for the day of my burial . [ d ]
NABRE	John	12	8	You always have the poor with you , but you do not always have me. ” ( F )
NABRE	John	12	9	[ The ] large crowd of the Jews found out that he was there and came , not only because of Jesus , but also to see Lazarus , whom he had raised from the dead . ( G )
NABRE	John	12	10	And the chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus too ,
NABRE	John	12	11	because many of the Jews were turning away and believing in Jesus because of him . ( H ) The Entry into Jerusalem . [ e ]
NABRE	John	12	13	they took palm branches [ f ] and went out to meet him , and cried out : “ Hosanna ! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord , [ even ] the king of Israel. ” ( J )
NABRE	John	12	14	Jesus found an ass and sat upon it , as is written :
NABRE	John	12	16	His disciples did not understand this at first , but when Jesus had been glorified they remembered that these things were written about him and that they had done this [ h ] for him . ( L )
NABRE	John	12	17	[ i ] So the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from death continued to testify .
NABRE	John	12	18	This was [ also ] why the crowd went to meet him , because they heard that he had done this sign .
NABRE	John	12	19	So the Pharisees said to one another , “ You see that you are gaining nothing . Look , the whole world [ j ] has gone after him. ” ( M ) The Coming of Jesus ’ Hour . [ k ]
NABRE	John	12	20	Now there were some Greeks [ l ] among those who had come up to worship at the feast . ( N )
NABRE	John	12	21	[ m ] They came to Philip , who was from Bethsaida in Galilee , and asked him , “ Sir , we would like to see Jesus. ” ( O )
NABRE	John	12	22	Philip went and told Andrew ; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus . ( P )
NABRE	John	12	23	[ n ] Jesus answered them , ( Q ) “ The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified .
NABRE	John	12	24	[ o ] Amen , amen , I say to you , unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies , it remains just a grain of wheat ; ( R ) but if it dies , it produces much fruit .
NABRE	John	12	25	Whoever loves his life [ p ] loses it , and whoever hates his life in this world will preserve it for eternal life . ( S )
NABRE	John	12	26	Whoever serves me must follow me , and where I am , there also will my servant be . The Father will honor whoever serves me . ( T )
NABRE	John	12	27	“ I am troubled [ q ] now . Yet what should I say ? ‘ Father , save me from this hour ’ ? But it was for this purpose that I came to this hour . ( U )
NABRE	John	12	28	Father , glorify your name. ” Then a voice came from heaven , “ I have glorified it and will glorify it again. ” ( V )
NABRE	John	12	29	The crowd there heard it and said it was thunder ; but others said , “ An angel has spoken to him. ” ( W )
NABRE	John	12	30	Jesus answered and said , “ This voice did not come for my sake but for yours . ( X )
NABRE	John	12	31	Now is the time of judgment on this world ; now the ruler of this world [ r ] will be driven out . ( Y )
NABRE	John	12	32	And when I am lifted up from the earth , I will draw everyone to myself. ” ( Z )
NABRE	John	12	33	He said this indicating the kind of death he would die .
NABRE	John	12	34	So the crowd answered him , “ We have heard from the law that the Messiah remains forever . [ s ] Then how can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up ? Who is this Son of Man ? ” ( AA )
NABRE	John	12	35	Jesus said to them , “ The light will be among you only a little while . Walk while you have the light , so that darkness may not overcome you . Whoever walks in the dark does not know where he is going . ( AB )
NABRE	John	12	36	While you have the light , believe in the light , so that you may become children of the light. ” ( AC ) Unbelief and Belief Among the Jews . After he had said this , Jesus left and hid from them .
NABRE	John	12	37	[ t ] ( AD ) Although he had performed so many signs in their presence they did not believe in him ,
NABRE	John	12	38	[ u ] in order that the word which Isaiah the prophet spoke might be fulfilled : “ Lord , who has believed our preaching , to whom has the might of the Lord been revealed ? ” ( AE )
NABRE	John	12	39	For this reason they could not believe , because again Isaiah said :
NABRE	John	12	40	“ He blinded their eyes and hardened their heart , so that they might not see with their eyes and understand with their heart and be converted , and I would heal them. ” ( AF )
NABRE	John	12	41	Isaiah said this because he saw his glory [ v ] and spoke about him . ( AG )
NABRE	John	12	42	Nevertheless , many , even among the authorities , believed in him , but because of the Pharisees they did not acknowledge it openly in order not to be expelled from the synagogue . ( AH )
NABRE	John	12	43	For they preferred human praise to the glory of God . ( AI ) Recapitulation .
NABRE	John	12	44	Jesus cried out and said , “ Whoever believes in me believes not only in me but also in the one who sent me , ( AJ )
NABRE	John	12	45	and whoever sees me sees the one who sent me . ( AK )
NABRE	John	12	46	I came into the world as light , so that everyone who believes in me might not remain in darkness . ( AL )
NABRE	John	12	47	And if anyone hears my words and does not observe them , I do not condemn him , for I did not come to condemn the world but to save the world . ( AM )
NABRE	John	12	48	Whoever rejects me and does not accept my words has something to judge him : the word that I spoke , it will condemn him on the last day , ( AN )
NABRE	John	12	49	because I did not speak on my own , but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and speak . ( AO )
NABRE	John	12	50	And I know that his commandment is eternal life . So what I say , I say as the Father told me. ” Footnotes - 12:1–8 This is probably the same scene of anointing found in Mk 14:3–9 ( see note there ) and Mt 26:6–13 . The anointing by a penitent woman in Lk 7:36–38 is different . Details from these various episodes have become interchanged . - 12:3 The feet of Jesus : so Mk 14:3 ; but in Mt 26:6 , Mary anoints Jesus ’ head as a sign of regal , messianic anointing . - 12:5 Days ’ wages : literally , “ denarii. ” A denarius is a day ’ s wage in Mt 20:2 ; see note on Jn 6:7 . - 12:7 Jesus ’ response reflects the rabbinical discussion of what was the greatest act of mercy , almsgiving or burying the dead . Those who favored proper burial of the dead thought it an essential condition for sharing in the resurrection . - 12:12–19 In John , the entry into Jerusalem follows the anointing whereas in the synoptics it precedes . In John , the crowd , not the disciples , are responsible for the triumphal procession . - 12:13 Palm branches : used to welcome great conquerors ; cf .

NABRE	John	13	13	You call me ‘ teacher ’ and ‘ master , ’ and rightly so , for indeed I am . ( H )
NABRE	John	13	1	Cor 6:11 ; Eph 5:26 ; Ti 3:5 ; Hb 10:22 . - 13:16 Messenger : the Greek has apostolos , the only occurrence of the term in John . It is not used in the technical sense here . - 13:23 The one whom Jesus loved : also mentioned in Jn 19:26 ; 20:2 ; 21:7 . A disciple , called “ another disciple ” or “ the other disciple , ” is mentioned in Jn 18:15 and Jn 20:2 ; in the latter reference he is identified with the disciple whom Jesus loved . There is also an unnamed disciple in Jn 1:35–40 ; see note on Jn 1:37 . - 13:26 Morsel : probably the bitter herb dipped in salt water . - 13:31–17:26 Two farewell discourses and a prayer . These seem to be Johannine compositions , including sayings of Jesus at the Last Supper and on other occasions , modeled on similar farewell discourses in Greek literature and the Old Testament ( of Moses , Joshua , David ) . - 13:31–38 Introduction : departure and return . Terms of coming and going predominate . These verses form an introduction to the last discourse of Jesus , which extends through Jn 14–17 . In it John has collected Jesus ’ words to his own ( Jn 13:1 ) . There are indications that several speeches have been fused together , e.g. , in Jn 14:31 and Jn 17:1 . - 13:34 I give you a new commandment : this puts Jesus on a par with Yahweh . The commandment itself is not new ; cf . Lv 19:18 and the note there . Scripture texts , prefaces , introductions , footnotes and cross references used in this work are taken from the New American Bible , revised edition ©
NABRE	John	13	2	The devil had already induced [ d ] Judas , son of Simon the Iscariot , to hand him over . So , during supper , ( B )
NABRE	John	13	3	fully aware that the Father had put everything into his power and that he had come from God and was returning to God , ( C )
NABRE	John	13	4	he rose from supper and took off his outer garments . He took a towel and tied it around his waist .
NABRE	John	13	5	[ e ] Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples ’ feet ( D ) and dry them with the towel around his waist .
NABRE	John	13	6	He came to Simon Peter , who said to him , “ Master , are you going to wash my feet ? ”
NABRE	John	13	7	Jesus answered and said to him , “ What I am doing , you do not understand now , but you will understand later. ”
NABRE	John	13	8	Peter said to him , “ You will never wash my feet. ” Jesus answered him , “ Unless I wash you , you will have no inheritance with me. ” ( E )
NABRE	John	13	9	Simon Peter said to him , “ Master , then not only my feet , but my hands and head as well. ”
NABRE	John	13	10	Jesus said to him , “ Whoever has bathed [ f ] has no need except to have his feet washed , for he is clean all over ; so you are clean , but not all. ” ( F )
NABRE	John	13	11	For he knew who would betray him ; for this reason , he said , “ Not all of you are clean. ” ( G )
NABRE	John	13	12	So when he had washed their feet [ and ] put his garments back on and reclined at table again , he said to them , “ Do you realize what I have done for you ?
NABRE	John	13	14	If I , therefore , the master and teacher , have washed your feet , you ought to wash one another ’ s feet .
NABRE	John	13	15	I have given you a model to follow , so that as I have done for you , you should also do . ( I )
NABRE	John	13	16	Amen , amen , I say to you , no slave is greater than his master nor any messenger [ g ] greater than the one who sent him . ( J )
NABRE	John	13	17	If you understand this , blessed are you if you do it .
NABRE	John	13	18	I am not speaking of all of you . I know those whom I have chosen . But so that the scripture might be fulfilled , ‘ The one who ate my food has raised his heel against me. ’ ( K )
NABRE	John	13	19	From now on I am telling you before it happens , so that when it happens you may believe that I AM .
NABRE	John	13	20	Amen , amen , I say to you , whoever receives the one I send receives me , and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me. ” ( L ) Announcement of Judas ’ s Betrayal . ( M )
NABRE	John	13	21	When he had said this , Jesus was deeply troubled and testified , “ Amen , amen , I say to you , one of you will betray me. ”
NABRE	John	13	22	The disciples looked at one another , at a loss as to whom he meant .
NABRE	John	13	23	One of his disciples , the one whom Jesus loved , [ h ] was reclining at Jesus ’ side . ( N )
NABRE	John	13	24	So Simon Peter nodded to him to find out whom he meant .
NABRE	John	13	25	He leaned back against Jesus ’ chest and said to him , “ Master , who is it ? ” ( O )
NABRE	John	13	26	Jesus answered , “ It is the one to whom I hand the morsel [ i ] after I have dipped it. ” So he dipped the morsel and [ took it and ] handed it to Judas , son of Simon the Iscariot .
NABRE	John	13	27	After he took the morsel , Satan entered him . So Jesus said to him , “ What you are going to do , do quickly. ” ( P )
NABRE	John	13	28	[ Now ] none of those reclining at table realized why he said this to him .
NABRE	John	13	29	Some thought that since Judas kept the money bag , Jesus had told him , “ Buy what we need for the feast , ” or to give something to the poor . ( Q )
NABRE	John	13	30	So he took the morsel and left at once . And it was night . The New Commandment .
NABRE	John	13	31	[ j ] When he had left , Jesus said , [ k ] “ Now is the Son of Man glorified , and God is glorified in him .
NABRE	John	13	32	[ If God is glorified in him , ] God will also glorify him in himself , and he will glorify him at once . ( R )
NABRE	John	13	33	My children , I will be with you only a little while longer . You will look for me , and as I told the Jews , ‘ Where I go you can not come , ’ so now I say it to you . ( S )
NABRE	John	13	34	I give you a new commandment : [ l ] love one another . As I have loved you , so you also should love one another . ( T )
NABRE	John	13	35	This is how all will know that you are my disciples , if you have love for one another. ” Peter ’ s Denial Predicted .
NABRE	John	13	36	Simon Peter said to him , “ Master , where are you going ? ” Jesus answered [ him ] , “ Where I am going , you can not follow me now , though you will follow later. ” ( U )
NABRE	John	13	37	Peter said to him , “ Master , why can ’ t I follow you now ? I will lay down my life for you. ”
NABRE	John	13	38	Jesus answered , “ Will you lay down your life for me ? Amen , amen , I say to you , the cock will not crow before you deny me three times. ” ( V ) Footnotes - 13:1–19:42 The Book of Glory . There is a major break here ; the word “ sign ” is used again only in Jn 20:30 . In this phase of Jesus ’ return to the Father , the discourses ( Jn 13–17 ) precede the traditional narrative of the passion ( Jn 18–20 ) to interpret them for the Christian reader . This is the only extended example of esoteric teaching of disciples in John . - 13:1–20 Washing of the disciples ’ feet . This episode occurs in John at the place of the narration of the institution of the Eucharist in the synoptics . It may be a dramatization of Lk 22:27— “ I am your servant. ” It is presented as a “ model ” ( “ pattern ” ) of the crucifixion . It symbolizes cleansing from sin by sacrificial death . - 13:1 Before the feast of Passover : this would be Thursday evening , before the day of preparation ; in the synoptics , the Last Supper is a Passover meal taking place , in John ’ s chronology , on Friday evening . To the end : or , “ completely. ” - 13:2 Induced : literally , “ The devil put into the heart that Judas should hand him over. ” - 13:5 The act of washing another ’ s feet was one that could not be required of the lowliest Jewish slave . It is an allusion to the humiliating death of the crucifixion . - 13:10 Bathed : many have suggested that this passage is a symbolic reference to baptism . The Greek root involved is used in baptismal contexts in

NABRE	John	14	14	If you ask anything of me in my name , I will do it . The Advocate .
NABRE	John	14	1	Jn 2:1 , where Jesus is an advocate in the sense of intercessor in heaven . The Greek term derives from legal terminology for an advocate or defense attorney , and can mean spokesman , mediator , intercessor , comforter , consoler , although no one of these terms encompasses the meaning in John . The Paraclete in John is a teacher , a witness to Jesus , and a prosecutor of the world , who represents the continued presence on earth of the Jesus who has returned to the Father . - 14:17 The Spirit of truth : this term is also used at Qumran , where it is a moral force put into a person by God , as opposed to the spirit of perversity . It is more personal in John ; it will teach the realities of the new order ( Jn 14:26 ) , and testify to the truth ( Jn 14:6 ) . While it has been customary to use masculine personal pronouns in English for the Advocate , the Greek word for “ spirit ” is neuter , and the Greek text and manuscript variants fluctuate between masculine and neuter pronouns . - 14:18 I will come to you : indwelling , not parousia . - 14:22 Judas , not the Iscariot : probably not the brother of Jesus in Mk 6:3 // Mt 13:55 or the apostle named Jude in Lk 6:16 , but Thomas ( see note on Jn 11:16 ) , although other readings have “ Judas the Cananean. ” - 14:27 Peace : the traditional Hebrew salutation šālôm ; but Jesus ’ “ Shalom ” is a gift of salvation , connoting the bounty of messianic blessing . - 14:28 The Father is greater than I : because he sent , gave , etc. , and Jesus is “ a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God ” ( Jn 8:40 ) . - 14:30 The ruler of the world : Satan ; cf .

NABRE	John	14	2	In my Father ’ s house there are many dwelling places . If there were not , would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you ?
NABRE	John	14	3	[ c ] And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come back again and take you to myself , so that where I am you also may be . ( A )
NABRE	John	14	4	Where [ I ] am going you know the way. ” [ d ]
NABRE	John	14	5	Thomas said to him , “ Master , we do not know where you are going ; how can we know the way ? ”
NABRE	John	14	6	Jesus said to him , “ I am the way and the truth [ e ] and the life . No one comes to the Father except through me . ( B )
NABRE	John	14	7	If you know me , then you will also know my Father . [ f ] From now on you do know him and have seen him. ” ( C )
NABRE	John	14	8	Philip said to him , “ Master , show us the Father , [ g ] and that will be enough for us. ” ( D )
NABRE	John	14	9	Jesus said to him , “ Have I been with you for so long a time and you still do not know me , Philip ? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father . How can you say , ‘ Show us the Father ’ ? ( E )
NABRE	John	14	10	Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me ? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on my own . The Father who dwells in me is doing his works . ( F )
NABRE	John	14	11	Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me , or else , believe because of the works themselves . ( G )
NABRE	John	14	12	Amen , amen , I say to you , whoever believes in me will do the works that I do , and will do greater ones than these , because I am going to the Father . ( H )
NABRE	John	14	13	And whatever you ask in my name , I will do , so that the Father may be glorified in the Son . ( I )
NABRE	John	14	15	“ If you love me , you will keep my commandments . ( J )

NABRE	John	14	18	I will not leave you orphans ; I will come to you . [ j ]
NABRE	John	14	19	In a little while the world will no longer see me , but you will see me , because I live and you will live . ( M )
NABRE	John	14	20	On that day you will realize that I am in my Father and you are in me and I in you . ( N )

NABRE	John	14	22	. - 14:6 The truth : in John , the divinely revealed reality of the Father manifested in the person and works of Jesus . The possession of truth confers knowledge and liberation from sin ( Jn 8:32 ) . - 14:7 An alternative reading , “ If you knew me , then you would have known my Father also , ” would be a rebuke , as in Jn 8:19 . - 14:8 Show us the Father : Philip is pictured asking for a theophany like Ex 24:9–10 ; 33:18 . - 14:16 Another Advocate : Jesus is the first advocate ( paraclete ) ; see
NABRE	John	14	23	; 22:4 ; 24:14 ,

NABRE	John	14	27	: “ Do not let your hearts be troubled. ” - 14:1 You have faith : could also be imperative : “ Have faith. ” - 14:3 Come back again : a rare Johannine reference to the parousia ; cf .
NABRE	John	14	28	[ m ] You heard me tell you , ‘ I am going away and I will come back to you. ’ ( T ) If you loved me , you would rejoice that I am going to the Father ; for the Father is greater than I .

NABRE	John	15	15	I no longer call you slaves , because a slave does not know what his master is doing . I have called you friends , [ f ] because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father . ( K )
NABRE	John	15	1	[ a ] “ I am the true vine , [ b ] and my Father is the vine grower . ( A )
NABRE	John	15	2	Chr 20:7 ; cf . Jas 2:23 ) was called a “ friend of God. ” - 15:18–16:4 The hostile reaction of the world . There are synoptic parallels , predicting persecution , especially at Mt 10:17–25 ; 24:9–10 . - 15:20 The word I spoke to you : a reference to Jn 13:16 . - 15:21 On account of my name : the idea of persecution for Jesus ’ name is frequent in the New Testament ( Mt 10:22 ; 24:9 ; Acts 9:14 ) . For John , association with Jesus ’ name implies union with Jesus . - 15:22 ,
NABRE	John	15	3	You are already pruned because of the word that I spoke to you . ( B )
NABRE	John	15	4	Remain in me , as I remain in you . Just as a branch can not bear fruit on its own unless it remains on the vine , so neither can you unless you remain in me .
NABRE	John	15	5	I am the vine , you are the branches . Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit , because without me you can do nothing .
NABRE	John	15	6	[ d ] ( C ) Anyone who does not remain in me will be thrown out like a branch and wither ; people will gather them and throw them into a fire and they will be burned .
NABRE	John	15	7	If you remain in me and my words remain in you , ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you . ( D )
NABRE	John	15	8	By this is my Father glorified , that you bear much fruit and become my disciples . ( E )
NABRE	John	15	9	As the Father loves me , so I also love you . Remain in my love . ( F )
NABRE	John	15	10	If you keep my commandments , you will remain in my love , just as I have kept my Father ’ s commandments and remain in his love . ( G )
NABRE	John	15	11	“ I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and your joy may be complete . ( H )
NABRE	John	15	12	This is my commandment : love one another as I love you . ( I )
NABRE	John	15	13	[ e ] No one has greater love than this , ( J ) to lay down one ’ s life for one ’ s friends .
NABRE	John	15	14	You are my friends if you do what I command you .
NABRE	John	15	16	It was not you who chose me , but I who chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain , so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you . ( L )
NABRE	John	15	17	This I command you : love one another . ( M ) The World ’ s Hatred . [ g ]
NABRE	John	15	18	“ If the world hates you , realize that it hated me first . ( N )
NABRE	John	15	19	If you belonged to the world , the world would love its own ; but because you do not belong to the world , and I have chosen you out of the world , the world hates you . ( O )
NABRE	John	15	20	Remember the word I spoke to you , [ h ] ‘ No slave is greater than his master. ’ If they persecuted me , they will also persecute you . If they kept my word , they will also keep yours . ( P )
NABRE	John	15	21	And they will do all these things to you on account of my name , [ i ] because they do not know the one who sent me . ( Q )
NABRE	John	15	22	If I had not come and spoken [ j ] to them , they would have no sin ; but as it is they have no excuse for their sin . ( R )
NABRE	John	15	23	Whoever hates me also hates my Father . ( S )
NABRE	John	15	24	Jesus ’ words ( spoken ) and deeds ( works ) are the great motives of credibility . They have seen and hated : probably means that they have seen his works and still have hated ; but the Greek can be read : “ have seen both me and my Father and still have hated both me and my Father. ” Works…that no one else ever did : so Yahweh in Dt 4:32–33 . - 15:25 In their law : law is here used as a larger concept than the Pentateuch , for the reference is to Ps 35:19 or Ps 69:5 . See notes on Jn 10:34 ; 12:34 . Their law reflects the argument of the church with the synagogue . - 15:26 Whom I will send : in Jn 14:16 ,
NABRE	John	15	25	But in order that the word written in their law [ k ] might be fulfilled , ‘ They hated me without cause. ’ ( U )
NABRE	John	15	26	, the Paraclete is to be sent by the Father , at the request of Jesus . Here the Spirit comes from both Jesus and the Father in mission ; there is no reference here to the eternal procession of the Spirit .

NABRE	John	15	27	And you also testify , because you have been with me from the beginning . ( W ) Footnotes - 15:1–16:4 Discourse on the union of Jesus with his disciples . His words become a monologue and go beyond the immediate crisis of the departure of Jesus . - 15:1–17 Like Jn 10:1–5 , this passage resembles a parable . Israel is spoken of as a vineyard at Is 5:1–7 ; Mt 21:33–46 and as a vine at Ps 80:9–17 ; Jer 2:21 ; Ez 15:2 ; 17:5–10 ; 19:10 ; Hos 10:1 . The identification of the vine as the Son of Man in Ps 80:15 and Wisdom ’ s description of herself as a vine in Sir 24:17 are further background for portrayal of Jesus by this figure . There may be secondary eucharistic symbolism here ; cf . Mk 14:25 , “ the fruit of the vine. ” - 15:2 Takes away…prunes : in Greek there is a play on two related verbs . - 15:6 Branches were cut off and dried on the wall of the vineyard for later use as fuel . - 15:13 For one ’ s friends : or : “ those whom one loves. ” In Jn 15:9–13a , the words for love are related to the Greek agapaō . In Jn 15:13b–15 , the words for love are related to the Greek phileō . For John , the two roots seem synonymous and mean “ to love ” ; cf . also Jn 21:15–17 . The word philos is used here . - 15:15 Slaves…friends : in the Old Testament , Moses ( Dt 34:5 ) , Joshua ( Jos 24:29 ) , and David ( Ps 89:21 ) were called “ servants ” or “ slaves of Yahweh ” ; only Abraham ( Is 41:8 ;

NABRE	John	16	16	“ A little while and you will no longer see me , and again a little while later and you will see me. ” ( I )
NABRE	John	16	1	“ I have told you this so that you may not fall away .
NABRE	John	16	2	They will expel you from the synagogues ; in fact , the hour [ a ] is coming when everyone who kills you will think he is offering worship to God . ( A )
NABRE	John	16	3	They will do this because they have not known either the Father or me . ( B )
NABRE	John	16	4	I have told you this so that when their hour comes you may remember that I told you . ( C ) Jesus ’ Departure ; Coming of the Advocate . [ b ] “ I did not tell you this from the beginning , because I was with you .
NABRE	John	16	5	But now I am going to the one who sent me , and not one of you asks me , [ c ] ‘ Where are you going ? ’ ( D )
NABRE	John	16	6	But because I told you this , grief has filled your hearts .
NABRE	John	16	7	But I tell you the truth , it is better for you that I go . For if I do not go , the Advocate will not come to you . ( E ) But if I go , I will send him to you .
NABRE	John	16	8	[ d ] And when he comes he will convict the world in regard to sin and righteousness and condemnation :
NABRE	John	16	9	sin , because they do not believe in me ; ( F )
NABRE	John	16	10	righteousness , because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see me ;
NABRE	John	16	11	condemnation , because the ruler of this world has been condemned . ( G )
NABRE	John	16	12	“ I have much more to tell you , but you can not bear it now .
NABRE	John	16	13	[ e ] But when he comes , the Spirit of truth , he will guide you to all truth . ( H ) He will not speak on his own , but he will speak what he hears , and will declare to you the things that are coming .
NABRE	John	16	14	He will glorify me , because he will take from what is mine and declare it to you .
NABRE	John	16	15	Everything that the Father has is mine ; for this reason I told you that he will take from what is mine and declare it to you .
NABRE	John	16	17	So some of his disciples said to one another , “ What does this mean that he is saying to us , ‘ A little while and you will not see me , and again a little while and you will see me , ’ and ‘ Because I am going to the Father ’ ? ”
NABRE	John	16	18	So they said , “ What is this ‘ little while ’ [ of which he speaks ] ? We do not know what he means. ”
NABRE	John	16	19	Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him , so he said to them , “ Are you discussing with one another what I said , ‘ A little while and you will not see me , and again a little while and you will see me ’ ?
NABRE	John	16	20	Amen , amen , I say to you , you will weep and mourn , while the world rejoices ; you will grieve , but your grief will become joy . ( J )
NABRE	John	16	21	When a woman is in labor , she is in anguish because her hour has arrived ; but when she has given birth to a child , she no longer remembers the pain because of her joy that a child has been born into the world . ( K )
NABRE	John	16	22	So you also are now in anguish . But I will see you again , and your hearts will rejoice , and no one will take your joy away from you . ( L )
NABRE	John	16	23	On that day you will not question me about anything . Amen , amen , I say to you , whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you . ( M )
NABRE	John	16	24	Until now you have not asked anything in my name ; ask and you will receive , so that your joy may be complete .
NABRE	John	16	25	[ f ] ( N ) “ I have told you this in figures of speech . The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures but I will tell you clearly about the Father .
NABRE	John	16	26	On that day you will ask in my name , and I do not tell you that I will ask the Father for you . ( O )
NABRE	John	16	27	For the Father himself loves you , because you have loved me and have come to believe that I came from God .
NABRE	John	16	28	I came from the Father and have come into the world . Now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father. ” ( P )
NABRE	John	16	29	His disciples said , “ Now you are talking plainly , and not in any figure of speech .
NABRE	John	16	30	Now we realize that you know everything and that you do not need to have anyone question you . Because of this we believe that you came from God. ” [ g ]
NABRE	John	16	31	Jesus answered them , “ Do you believe now ?
NABRE	John	16	32	Behold , the hour is coming and has arrived when each of you will be scattered [ h ] to his own home and you will leave me alone . But I am not alone , because the Father is with me . ( Q )
NABRE	John	16	33	I have told you this so that you might have peace in me . In the world you will have trouble , but take courage , I have conquered the world. ” ( R ) Footnotes - 16:2 Hour : of persecution , not Jesus ’ “ hour ” ( see note on Jn 2:4 ) . - 16:4b–33 A duplicate of Jn 14:1–31 on departure and return . - 16:5 Not one of you asks me : the difficulty of reconciling this with Simon Peter ’ s question in Jn 13:36 and Thomas ’ words in Jn 14:5 strengthens the supposition that the last discourse has been made up of several collections of Johannine material . - 16:8–11 These verses illustrate the forensic character of the Paraclete ’ s role : in the forum of the disciples ’ conscience he prosecutes the world . He leads believers to see ( a ) that the basic sin was and is refusal to believe in Jesus ; ( b ) that , although Jesus was found guilty and apparently died in disgrace , in reality righteousness has triumphed , for Jesus has returned to his Father ; ( c ) finally , that it is the ruler of this world , Satan , who has been condemned through Jesus ’ death ( Jn 12:32 ) . - 16:13 Declare to you the things that are coming : not a reference to new predictions about the future , but interpretation of what has already occurred or been said . - 16:25 See note on Jn 10:6 . Here , possibly a reference to Jn 15:1–16 or Jn 16:21 . - 16:30 The reference is seemingly to the fact that Jesus could anticipate their question in Jn 16:19 . The disciples naively think they have the full understanding that is the climax of “ the hour ” of Jesus ’ death , resurrection , and ascension ( Jn 16:25 ) , but the only part of the hour that is at hand for them is their share in the passion ( Jn 16:32 ) . - 16:32 You will be scattered : cf . Mk 14:27 and Mt 26:31 , where both cite Zec 13:7 about the sheep being dispersed .

NABRE	John	17	26	I made known to them your name and I will make it known , [ h ] that the love with which you loved me may be in them and I in them. ” Footnotes - 17:1–26 Climax of the last discourse ( s ) . Since the sixteenth century , this chapter has been called the “ high priestly prayer ” of Jesus . He speaks as intercessor , with words addressed directly to the Father and not to the disciples , who supposedly only overhear . Yet the prayer is one of petition , for immediate ( Jn 17:6–19 ) and future ( Jn 17:20–21 ) disciples . Many phrases reminiscent of the Lord ’ s Prayer occur . Although still in the world ( Jn 17:13 ) , Jesus looks on his earthly ministry as a thing of the past ( Jn 17:4 ,
NABRE	John	17	36	) , now he wishes them to be with him in union with the Father ( Jn 17:12–14 ) . - 17:1 The action of looking up to heaven and the address Father are typical of Jesus at prayer ; cf . Jn 11:41 and Lk 11:2 . - 17:2 Another possible interpretation is to treat the first line of the verse as parenthetical and the second as an appositive to the clause that ends v
NABRE	John	17	28	,
NABRE	John	17	58	; 13:19 . - 17:15 Note the resemblance to the petition of the Lord ’ s Prayer , “ deliver us from the evil one. ” Both probably refer to the devil rather than to abstract evil . - 17:24 Where I am : Jesus prays for the believers ultimately to join him in heaven . Then they will not see his glory as in a mirror but clearly (

NABRE	John	18	18	Now the slaves and the guards were standing around a charcoal fire that they had made , because it was cold , and were warming themselves . Peter was also standing there keeping warm . The Inquiry Before Annas . ( I )
NABRE	John	18	1	When he had said this , Jesus went out [ b ] with his disciples across the Kidron valley to where there was a garden , into which he and his disciples entered . ( A )
NABRE	John	18	2	Judas his betrayer also knew the place , because Jesus had often met there with his disciples .
NABRE	John	18	3	to
NABRE	John	18	4	Jesus , knowing everything that was going to happen to him , went out and said to them , “ Whom are you looking for ? ”
NABRE	John	18	5	They answered him , “ Jesus the Nazorean. ” [ d ] He said to them , “ I AM. ” Judas his betrayer was also with them .
NABRE	John	18	6	A.M . The Passover : the synoptic gospels give the impression that the Thursday night supper was the Passover meal ( Mk 14:12 ) ; for John that meal is still to be eaten Friday night . - 18:31 We do not have the right to execute anyone : only John gives this reason for their bringing Jesus to Pilate . Jewish sources are not clear on the competence of the Sanhedrin at this period to sentence and to execute for political crimes . - 18:32 The Jewish punishment for blasphemy was stoning ( Lv 24:16 ) . In coming to the Romans to ensure that Jesus would be crucified , the Jewish authorities fulfilled his prophecy that he would be exalted ( Jn 3:14 ; 12:32–33 ) . There is some historical evidence , however , for Jews crucifying Jews . - 18:37 You say I am a king : see Mt 26:64 for a similar response to the high priest . It is at best a reluctant affirmative . - 18:39 See note on Mt 27:15 . - 18:40 Barabbas : see note on Mt 27:16–17 .

NABRE	John	18	7	So he again asked them , “ Whom are you looking for ? ” They said , “ Jesus the Nazorean. ”
NABRE	John	18	8	Jesus answered , “ I told you that I AM . So if you are looking for me , let these men go. ”
NABRE	John	18	9	[ e ] ( C ) This was to fulfill what he had said , “ I have not lost any of those you gave me. ”
NABRE	John	18	10	Then Simon Peter , who had a sword , drew it , struck the high priest ’ s slave , and cut off his right ear . The slave ’ s name was Malchus . [ f ]
NABRE	John	18	11	Jesus said to Peter , “ Put your sword into its scabbard . Shall I not drink the cup [ g ] that the Father gave me ? ” ( D )
NABRE	John	18	12	( E ) So the band of soldiers , the tribune , and the Jewish guards seized Jesus , bound him ,
NABRE	John	18	13	and brought him to Annas [ h ] first . He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas , who was high priest that year . ( F )
NABRE	John	18	14	It was Caiaphas who had counseled the Jews that it was better that one man should die rather than the people . ( G ) Peter ’ s First Denial . ( H )
NABRE	John	18	15	Simon Peter and another disciple [ i ] followed Jesus . Now the other disciple was known to the high priest , and he entered the courtyard of the high priest with Jesus .
NABRE	John	18	16	But Peter stood at the gate outside . So the other disciple , the acquaintance of the high priest , went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter in .
NABRE	John	18	17	Then the maid who was the gatekeeper said to Peter , “ You are not one of this man ’ s disciples , are you ? ” He said , “ I am not. ”
NABRE	John	18	19	The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his doctrine .
NABRE	John	18	20	Jesus answered him , “ I have spoken publicly to the world . I have always taught in a synagogue or in the temple area [ j ] where all the Jews gather , and in secret I have said nothing . ( J )
NABRE	John	18	21	Why ask me ? Ask those who heard me what I said to them . They know what I said. ”
NABRE	John	18	22	When he had said this , one of the temple guards standing there struck Jesus and said , “ Is this the way you answer the high priest ? ” ( K )
NABRE	John	18	23	Jesus answered him , “ If I have spoken wrongly , testify to the wrong ; but if I have spoken rightly , why do you strike me ? ”
NABRE	John	18	24	Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas [ k ] the high priest . ( L ) Peter Denies Jesus Again . ( M )
NABRE	John	18	25	Now Simon Peter was standing there keeping warm . And they said to him , “ You are not one of his disciples , are you ? ” He denied it and said , “ I am not. ”
NABRE	John	18	26	One of the slaves of the high priest , a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off , said , “ Didn ’ t I see you in the garden with him ? ”
NABRE	John	18	27	Again Peter denied it . And immediately the cock crowed . [ l ] The Trial Before Pilate .
NABRE	John	18	28	( N ) Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium . [ m ] It was morning . And they themselves did not enter the praetorium , in order not to be defiled so that they could eat the Passover .
NABRE	John	18	29	So Pilate came out to them and said , “ What charge do you bring [ against ] this man ? ”
NABRE	John	18	30	They answered and said to him , “ If he were not a criminal , we would not have handed him over to you. ”
NABRE	John	18	31	At this , Pilate said to them , “ Take him yourselves , and judge him according to your law. ” The Jews answered him , “ We do not have the right to execute anyone , ” [ n ]
NABRE	John	18	32	[ o ] in order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled that he said indicating the kind of death ( O ) he would die .
NABRE	John	18	33	So Pilate went back into the praetorium and summoned Jesus and said to him , “ Are you the King of the Jews ? ”
NABRE	John	18	34	Jesus answered , “ Do you say this on your own or have others told you about me ? ”
NABRE	John	18	35	Pilate answered , “ I am not a Jew , am I ? Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me . What have you done ? ” ( P )
NABRE	John	18	36	Jesus answered , “ My kingdom does not belong to this world . If my kingdom did belong to this world , my attendants [ would ] be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews . But as it is , my kingdom is not here. ” ( Q )
NABRE	John	18	37	So Pilate said to him , “ Then you are a king ? ” Jesus answered , “ You say I am a king . [ p ] For this I was born and for this I came into the world , to testify to the truth . Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice. ” ( R )
NABRE	John	18	38	Pilate said to him , “ What is truth ? ” ( S ) When he had said this , he again went out to the Jews and said to them , “ I find no guilt in him .
NABRE	John	18	39	But you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover . [ q ] Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? ”
NABRE	John	18	40	They cried out again , “ Not this one but Barabbas ! ” [ r ] Now Barabbas was a revolutionary . Footnotes - 18:1–14 John does not mention the agony in the garden and the kiss of Judas , nor does he identify the place as Gethsemane or the Mount of Olives . - 18:1 Jesus went out : see Jn 14:31 , where it seems he is leaving the supper room . Kidron valley : literally , “ the winter-flowing Kidron ” ; this wadi has water only during the winter rains . - 18:3 Band of soldiers : seems to refer to Roman troops , either the full cohort of
NABRE	John	18	600	men ( 1/10 of a legion ) , or more likely the maniple of
NABRE	John	18	200	under their tribune ( Jn 18:12 ) . In this case , John is hinting at Roman collusion in the action against Jesus before he was brought to Pilate . The lanterns and torches may be symbolic of the hour of darkness . - 18:5 Nazorean : the form found in Mt 26:71 ( see note on Mt 2:23 ) is here used , not Nazarene of Mark . I AM : or “ I am he , ” but probably intended by the evangelist as an expression of divinity ( cf . their appropriate response in Jn 18:6 ) ; see note on Jn 8:24 . John sets the confusion of the arresting party against the background of Jesus ’ divine majesty . - 18:9 The citation may refer to Jn 6:39 ; 10:28 ; or 17:12 . - 18:10 Only John gives the names of the two antagonists ; both John and Luke mention the right ear . - 18:11 The theme of the cup is found in the synoptic account of the agony ( Mk 14:36 and parallels ) . - 18:13 Annas : only John mentions an inquiry before Annas ; cf . Jn 18:16 , 19–24 ; see note on Lk 3:2 . It is unlikely that this nighttime interrogation before Annas is the same as the trial before Caiaphas placed by Matthew and Mark at night and by Luke in the morning . - 18:15–16 Another disciple…the other disciple : see note on Jn 13:23 . - 18:20 I have always taught…in the temple area : cf . Mk 14:49 for a similar statement . - 18:24 Caiaphas : see Mt 26:3 ,
NABRE	John	18	57	; Lk 3:2 ; and the notes there . John may leave room here for the trial before Caiaphas described in the synoptic gospels . - 18:27 Cockcrow was the third Roman division of the night , lasting from midnight to

NABRE	John	19	19	[ h ] Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross . It read , “ Jesus the Nazorean , the King of the Jews. ”
NABRE	John	19	1	[ a ] ( A ) Then Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged .
NABRE	John	19	2	( the presence of the mother of Jesus , the address woman , and the mention of the hour ) and of the upper room in Jn
NABRE	John	19	3	and they came to him and said , “ Hail , King of the Jews ! ” And they struck him repeatedly .
NABRE	John	19	4	Once more Pilate went out and said to them , “ Look , I am bringing him out to you , so that you may know that I find no guilt in him. ” ( B )
NABRE	John	19	5	So Jesus came out , wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak . And he said to them , “ Behold , the man ! ” ( C )
NABRE	John	19	6	When the chief priests and the guards saw him they cried out , “ Crucify him , crucify him ! ” Pilate said to them , “ Take him yourselves and crucify him . I find no guilt in him. ” ( D )
NABRE	John	19	7	[ b ] The Jews answered , ( E ) “ We have a law , and according to that law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God. ”
NABRE	John	19	8	Now when Pilate heard this statement , he became even more afraid ,
NABRE	John	19	9	a.m. to
NABRE	John	19	10	So Pilate said to him , “ Do you not speak to me ? Do you not know that I have power to release you and I have power to crucify you ? ”
NABRE	John	19	11	Jesus answered [ him ] , “ You would have no power over me if it had not been given to you from above . For this reason the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin. ” ( G )
NABRE	John	19	12	noon , the time when , according to John , Jesus was sentenced to death , was the hour at which the priests began to slaughter Passover lambs in the temple ; see Jn 1:29 . - 19:16 He handed him over to them to be crucified : in context this would seem to mean “ handed him over to the chief priests. ” Lk 23:25 has a similar ambiguity . There is a polemic tendency in the gospels to place the guilt of the crucifixion on the Jewish authorities and to exonerate the Romans from blame . But John later mentions the Roman soldiers ( Jn 19:23 ) , and it was to these soldiers that Pilate handed Jesus over . - 19:17 Carrying the cross himself : a different picture from that of the synoptics , especially Lk 23:26 , where Simon of Cyrene is made to carry the cross , walking behind Jesus . In John ’ s theology , Jesus remained in complete control and master of his destiny ( cf . Jn 10:18 ) . Place of the Skull : the Latin word for skull is Calvaria ; hence “ Calvary. ” Golgotha is actually an Aramaic rather than a Hebrew word . - 19:19 The inscription differs with slightly different words in each of the four gospels . John ’ s form is fullest and gives the equivalent of the Latin INRI = Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum . Only John mentions its polyglot character ( Jn 19:20 ) and Pilate ’ s role in keeping the title unchanged ( Jn 19:21–22 ) . - 19:23–25a While all four gospels describe the soldiers casting lots to divide Jesus ’ garments ( see note on Mt 27:35 ) , only John quotes the underlying passage from Ps 22:19 , and only John sees each line of the poetic parallelism literally carried out in two separate actions ( Jn 19:23–24 ) . - 19:25 It is not clear whether four women are meant , or three ( i.e. , Mary the wife of Cl [ e ] opas [ cf . Lk 24:18 ] is in apposition with his mother ’ s sister ) or two ( his mother and his mother ’ s sister , i.e. , Mary of Cl [ e ] opas and Mary of Magdala ) . Only John mentions the mother of Jesus here . The synoptics have a group of women looking on from a distance at the cross ( Mk 15:40 ) . - 19:26–27 This scene has been interpreted literally , of Jesus ’ concern for his mother ; and symbolically , e.g. , in the light of the Cana story in Jn
NABRE	John	19	13	( the presence of the beloved disciple ; the hour ) . Now that the hour has come ( Jn 19:28 ) , Mary ( a symbol of the church ? ) is given a role as the mother of Christians ( personified by the beloved disciple ) ; or , as a representative of those seeking salvation , she is supported by the disciple who interprets Jesus ’ revelation ; or Jewish and Gentile Christianity ( or Israel and the Christian community ) are reconciled . - 19:28 The scripture…fulfilled : either in the scene of Jn 19:25–27 , or in the I thirst of Jn 19:28 . If the latter , Ps 22:16 ; 69:22 deserve consideration . - 19:29 Wine : John does not mention the drugged wine , a narcotic that Jesus refused as the crucifixion began ( Mk 15:23 ) , but only this final gesture of kindness at the end ( Mk 15:36 ) . Hyssop , a small plant , is scarcely suitable for carrying a sponge ( Mark mentions a reed ) and may be a symbolic reference to the hyssop used to daub the blood of the paschal lamb on the doorpost of the Hebrews ( Ex 12:22 ) . - 19:30 Handed over the spirit : there is a double nuance of dying ( giving up the last breath or spirit ) and that of passing on the holy Spirit ; see Jn 7:39 , which connects the giving of the Spirit with Jesus ’ glorious return to the Father , and Jn 20:22 , where the author portrays the conferral of the Spirit . - 19:34–35 John probably emphasizes these verses to show the reality of Jesus ’ death , against the docetic heretics . In the blood and water there may also be a symbolic reference to the Eucharist and baptism . - 19:35 He knows : it is not certain from the Greek that this he is the eyewitness of the first part of the sentence . May [ come to ] believe : see note on Jn 20:31 . - 19:38–42 In the first three gospels there is no anointing on Friday . In Matthew and Luke the women come to the tomb on Sunday morning precisely to anoint Jesus .

NABRE	John	19	14	It was preparation day for Passover , and it was about noon . [ e ] And he said to the Jews , “ Behold , your king ! ”
NABRE	John	19	15	They cried out , “ Take him away , take him away ! Crucify him ! ” Pilate said to them , “ Shall I crucify your king ? ” The chief priests answered , “ We have no king but Caesar. ”
NABRE	John	19	16	Then he handed him over to them to be crucified . [ f ] The Crucifixion of Jesus . So they took Jesus ,
NABRE	John	19	17	( I ) and carrying the cross himself [ g ] he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull , in Hebrew , Golgotha .
NABRE	John	19	18	There they crucified him , and with him two others , one on either side , with Jesus in the middle .
NABRE	John	19	20	Now many of the Jews read this inscription , because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city ; and it was written in Hebrew , Latin , and Greek .
NABRE	John	19	21	So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate , “ Do not write ‘ The King of the Jews , ’ but that he said , ‘ I am the King of the Jews. ’ ” ( J )
NABRE	John	19	22	Pilate answered , “ What I have written , I have written. ”
NABRE	John	19	23	[ i ] When the soldiers had crucified Jesus , ( K ) they took his clothes and divided them into four shares , a share for each soldier . ( L ) They also took his tunic , but the tunic was seamless , woven in one piece from the top down .
NABRE	John	19	24	So they said to one another , “ Let ’ s not tear it , but cast lots for it to see whose it will be , ” in order that the passage of scripture might be fulfilled [ that says ] : “ They divided my garments among them , and for my vesture they cast lots. ” This is what the soldiers did .
NABRE	John	19	25	[ j ] ( M ) Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother ’ s sister , Mary the wife of Clopas , and Mary of Magdala .
NABRE	John	19	26	When Jesus saw his mother [ k ] and the disciple there whom he loved , he said to his mother , “ Woman , behold , your son. ” ( N )
NABRE	John	19	27	Then he said to the disciple , “ Behold , your mother. ” And from that hour the disciple took her into his home .
NABRE	John	19	28	( O ) After this , aware that everything was now finished , in order that the scripture might be fulfilled , [ l ] Jesus said , “ I thirst. ” ( P )
NABRE	John	19	29	There was a vessel filled with common wine . [ m ] So they put a sponge soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop and put it up to his mouth .
NABRE	John	19	30	[ n ] When Jesus had taken the wine , he said , “ It is finished. ” ( Q ) And bowing his head , he handed over the spirit . The Blood and Water .
NABRE	John	19	31	Now since it was preparation day , in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath , for the sabbath day of that week was a solemn one , the Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken and they be taken down . ( R )
NABRE	John	19	32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus .
NABRE	John	19	33	But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead , they did not break his legs ,
NABRE	John	19	34	[ o ] ( S ) but one soldier thrust his lance into his side , and immediately blood and water flowed out .
NABRE	John	19	35	An eyewitness has testified , and his testimony is true ; he knows [ p ] that he is speaking the truth , so that you also may [ come to ] believe . ( T )
NABRE	John	19	36	For this happened so that the scripture passage might be fulfilled : “ Not a bone of it will be broken. ” ( U )
NABRE	John	19	37	And again another passage says : “ They will look upon him whom they have pierced. ” ( V ) The Burial of Jesus . [ q ]
NABRE	John	19	38	( W ) After this , Joseph of Arimathea , secretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews , asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus . And Pilate permitted it . So he came and took his body .
NABRE	John	19	39	Nicodemus , the one who had first come to him at night , also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about one hundred pounds . ( X )
NABRE	John	19	40	They took the body of Jesus and bound it with burial cloths along with the spices , according to the Jewish burial custom .
NABRE	John	19	41	Now in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden , and in the garden a new tomb , in which no one had yet been buried .
NABRE	John	19	42	So they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day ; for the tomb was close by . Footnotes - 19:1 Luke places the mockery of Jesus at the midpoint in the trial when Jesus was sent to Herod . Mark and Matthew place the scourging and mockery at the end of the trial after the sentence of death . Scourging was an integral part of the crucifixion penalty . - 19:7 Made himself the Son of God : this question was not raised in John ’ s account of the Jewish interrogations of Jesus as it was in the synoptic account . Nevertheless , see Jn 5:18 ; 8:53 ; 10:36 . - 19:12 Friend of Caesar : a Roman honorific title bestowed upon high-ranking officials for merit . - 19:13 Seated him : others translate “ ( Pilate ) sat down. ” In John ’ s thought , Jesus is the real judge of the world , and John may here be portraying him seated on the judgment bench . Stone Pavement : in Greek lithostrotos ; under the fortress Antonia , one of the conjectured locations of the praetorium , a massive stone pavement has been excavated . Gabbatha ( Aramaic rather than Hebrew ) probably means “ ridge , elevation. ” - 19:14 Noon : Mk 15:25 has Jesus crucified “ at the third hour , ” which means either

NABRE	John	20	20	When he had said this , he showed them his hands and his side . [ m ] The disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord . ( K )
NABRE	John	20	1	Cor 15:4 . Some individual Old Testament passages suggested are Ps 16:10 ; Hos 6:2 ; Jon 2:1 ,
NABRE	John	20	2	Kgs 2:9–12 ) . To my Father and your Father , to my God and your God : this echoes Ru 1:16 : “ Your people shall be my people , and your God my God. ” The Father of Jesus will now become the Father of the disciples because , once ascended , Jesus can give them the Spirit that comes from the Father and they can be reborn as God ’ s children ( Jn 3:5 ) . That is why he calls them my brothers . - 20:19–29 The appearances to the disciples , without or with Thomas ( cf . Jn 11:16 ; 14:5 ) , have rough parallels in the other gospels only for Jn 20:19–23 ; cf . Lk 24:36–39 ; Mk 16:14–18 . - 20:19 The disciples : by implication from Jn 20:24 this means ten of the Twelve , presumably in Jerusalem . Peace be with you : although this could be an ordinary greeting , John intends here to echo Jn 14:27 . The theme of rejoicing in Jn 20:20 echoes Jn 16:22 . - 20:20 Hands and…side : Lk 24:39–40 mentions “ hands and feet , ” based on Ps 22:17 . - 20:21 By means of this sending , the Eleven were made apostles , that is , “ those sent ” ( cf . Jn 17:18 ) , though John does not use the noun in reference to them ( see note on Jn 13:16 ) . A solemn mission or “ sending ” is also the subject of the post-resurrection appearances to the Eleven in Mt 28:19 ; Lk 24:47 ; Mk 16:15 . - 20:22 This action recalls Gn 2:7 , where God breathed on the first man and gave him life ; just as Adam ’ s life came from God , so now the disciples ’ new spiritual life comes from Jesus . Cf . also the revivification of the dry bones in Ez
NABRE	John	20	3	[ e ] So Peter and the other disciple went out and came to the tomb .
NABRE	John	20	4	They both ran , but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and arrived at the tomb first ;
NABRE	John	20	5	he bent down and saw the burial cloths there , but did not go in .
NABRE	John	20	6	( C ) When Simon Peter arrived after him , he went into the tomb and saw the burial cloths [ f ] there ,
NABRE	John	20	7	and the cloth that had covered his head , not with the burial cloths but rolled up in a separate place . ( D )
NABRE	John	20	8	Then the other disciple also went in , the one who had arrived at the tomb first , and he saw and believed .
NABRE	John	20	9	[ g ] ( E ) For they did not yet understand the scripture that he had to rise from the dead .
NABRE	John	20	10	. - 20:11–18 This appearance to Mary is found only in John , but cf . Mt 28:8–10 and Mk 16:9–11 . - 20:16 Rabbouni : Hebrew or Aramaic for “ my master. ” - 20:17 Stop holding on to me : see Mt 28:9 , where the women take hold of his feet . I have not yet ascended : for John and many of the New Testament writers , the ascension in the theological sense of going to the Father to be glorified took place with the resurrection as one action . This scene in John dramatizes such an understanding , for by Easter night Jesus is glorified and can give the Spirit . Therefore his ascension takes place immediately after he has talked to Mary . In such a view , the ascension after forty days described in Acts 1:1–11 would be simply a termination of earthly appearances or , perhaps better , an introduction to the conferral of the Spirit upon the early church , modeled on Elisha ’ s being able to have a ( double ) share in the spirit of Elijah if he saw him being taken up ( same verb as ascending ) into heaven (
NABRE	John	20	11	But Mary stayed outside the tomb weeping . ( F ) And as she wept , she bent over into the tomb
NABRE	John	20	12	and saw two angels in white sitting there , one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been .
NABRE	John	20	13	And they said to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? ” She said to them , “ They have taken my Lord , and I don ’ t know where they laid him. ”
NABRE	John	20	14	When she had said this , she turned around and saw Jesus there , but did not know it was Jesus . ( G )
NABRE	John	20	15	Jesus said to her , “ Woman , why are you weeping ? Whom are you looking for ? ” ( H ) She thought it was the gardener and said to him , “ Sir , if you carried him away , tell me where you laid him , and I will take him. ”
NABRE	John	20	16	Jesus said to her , “ Mary ! ” She turned and said to him in Hebrew , “ Rabbouni , ” [ i ] which means Teacher .
NABRE	John	20	17	Jesus said to her , “ Stop holding on to me , [ j ] for I have not yet ascended to the Father . But go to my brothers and tell them , ‘ I am going to my Father and your Father , to my God and your God. ’ ” ( I )
NABRE	John	20	18	Mary of Magdala went and announced to the disciples , “ I have seen the Lord , ” and what he told her . Appearance to the Disciples . [ k ]
NABRE	John	20	19	On the evening of that first day of the week , ( J ) when the doors were locked , where the disciples [ l ] were , for fear of the Jews , Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them , “ Peace be with you. ”
NABRE	John	20	21	[ n ] [ Jesus ] said to them again , ( L ) “ Peace be with you . As the Father has sent me , so I send you. ”
NABRE	John	20	22	[ o ] And when he had said this , he breathed on them and said to them , ( M ) “ Receive the holy Spirit .
NABRE	John	20	23	[ p ] ( N ) Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them , and whose sins you retain are retained. ” Thomas .
NABRE	John	20	24	Thomas , called Didymus , one of the Twelve , was not with them when Jesus came .
NABRE	John	20	25	So the other disciples said to him , “ We have seen the Lord. ” But he said to them , “ Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands and put my finger into the nailmarks and put my hand into his side , I will not believe. ” ( O )
NABRE	John	20	26	Now a week later his disciples were again inside and Thomas was with them . Jesus came , although the doors were locked , and stood in their midst and said , “ Peace be with you. ” ( P )
NABRE	John	20	27	Then he said to Thomas , “ Put your finger here and see my hands , and bring your hand and put it into my side , and do not be unbelieving , but believe. ”
NABRE	John	20	28	[ q ] ( Q ) Thomas answered and said to him , “ My Lord and my God ! ”
NABRE	John	20	29	[ r ] Jesus said to him , “ Have you come to believe because you have seen me ? ( R ) Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed. ” Conclusion . [ s ]
NABRE	John	20	30	Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of [ his ] disciples that are not written in this book . ( S )
NABRE	John	20	31	But these are written that you may [ come to ] believe that Jesus is the Messiah , the Son of God , and that through this belief you may have life in his name . ( T ) Footnotes - 20:1–31 The risen Jesus reveals his glory and confers the Spirit . This story fulfills the basic need for testimony to the resurrection . What we have here is not a record but a series of single stories . - 20:1–10 The story of the empty tomb is found in both the Matthean and the Lucan traditions ; John ’ s version seems to be a fusion of the two . - 20:1 Still dark : according to Mark the sun had risen , Matthew describes it as “ dawning , ” and Luke refers to early dawn . Mary sees the stone removed , not the empty tomb . - 20:2 Mary runs away , not directed by an angel/young man as in the synoptic accounts . The plural “ we ” in the second part of her statement might reflect a tradition of more women going to the tomb . - 20:3–10 The basic narrative is told of Peter alone in Lk 24:12 , a verse missing in important manuscripts and which may be borrowed from tradition similar to John . Cf . also Lk 24:24 . - 20:6–8 Some special feature about the state of the burial cloths caused the beloved disciple to believe . Perhaps the details emphasized that the grave had not been robbed . - 20:9 Probably a general reference to the scriptures is intended , as in Lk 24:26 and
NABRE	John	20	37	. This is the author ’ s version of Pentecost . Cf . also the note on Jn 19:30 . - 20:23 The Council of Trent defined that this power to forgive sins is exercised in the sacrament of penance . See Mt 16:19 ; 18:18 . - 20:28 My Lord and my God : this forms a literary inclusion with the first verse of the gospel : “ and the Word was God. ” - 20:29 This verse is a beatitude on future generations ; faith , not sight , matters . - 20:30–31 These verses are clearly a conclusion to the gospel and express its purpose . While many manuscripts read come to believe , possibly implying a missionary purpose for John ’ s gospel , a small number of quite early ones read “ continue to believe , ” suggesting that the audience consists of Christians whose faith is to be deepened by the book ; cf .

NABRE	John	21	3	[ c ] Simon Peter said to them , “ I am going fishing. ” They said to him , “ We also will come with you. ” So they went out and got into the boat , but that night they caught nothing . ( B )
NABRE	John	21	4	When it was already dawn , Jesus was standing on the shore ; but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus . ( C )
NABRE	John	21	5	Jesus said to them , “ Children , have you caught anything to eat ? ” They answered him , “ No. ” ( D )
NABRE	John	21	6	So he said to them , “ Cast the net over the right side of the boat and you will find something. ” So they cast it , and were not able to pull it in because of the number of fish .
NABRE	John	21	7	So the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter , “ It is the Lord. ” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he tucked in his garment , for he was lightly clad , and jumped into the sea .
NABRE	John	21	8	The other disciples came in the boat , for they were not far from shore , only about a hundred yards , dragging the net with the fish .
NABRE	John	21	9	[ d ] ( E ) When they climbed out on shore , they saw a charcoal fire with fish on it and bread .
NABRE	John	21	10	Jesus said to them , “ Bring some of the fish you just caught. ”
NABRE	John	21	11	So Simon Peter went over and dragged the net ashore full of one hundred fifty-three [ e ] large fish . Even though there were so many , the net was not torn . ( F )
NABRE	John	21	12	Jesus said to them , “ Come , have breakfast. ” And none of the disciples dared to ask him , [ f ] “ Who are you ? ” because they realized it was the Lord .
NABRE	John	21	13	Jesus came over and took the bread and gave it to them , and in like manner the fish . ( G )
NABRE	John	21	14	[ g ] This was now the third time ( H ) Jesus was revealed to his disciples after being raised from the dead . Jesus and Peter . [ h ]
NABRE	John	21	15	When they had finished breakfast , Jesus said to Simon Peter , [ i ] “ Simon , son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” [ j ] He said to him , “ Yes , Lord , you know that I love you. ” He said to him , “ Feed my lambs. ”

NABRE	John	21	18	[ k ] Amen , amen , I say to you , ( J ) when you were younger , you used to dress yourself and go where you wanted ; but when you grow old , you will stretch out your hands , and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go. ”
NABRE	John	21	19	He said this signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God . And when he had said this , he said to him , “ Follow me. ” ( K ) The Beloved Disciple .
NABRE	John	21	20	and
NABRE	John	21	22	Jesus said to him , “ What if I want him to remain until I come ? [ l ] What concern is it of yours ? You follow me. ” ( M )
NABRE	John	21	23	[ m ] So the word spread among the brothers that that disciple would not die . But Jesus had not told him that he would not die , just “ What if I want him to remain until I come ? [ What concern is it of yours ? ] ” Conclusion .
NABRE	John	21	24	It is this disciple who testifies to these things and has written them , [ n ] and we know that his testimony is true . ( N )

NABRE	John	21	153	is the sum of the numbers from
NABRE	John	21	26	. - 21:15–23 This section constitutes Peter ’ s rehabilitation and emphasizes his role in the church . - 21:15–17 In these three verses there is a remarkable variety of synonyms : two different Greek verbs for love ( see note on Jn 15:13 ) ; two verbs for feed/tend ; two nouns for sheep ; two verbs for know . But apparently there is no difference of meaning . The threefold confession of Peter is meant to counteract his earlier threefold denial ( Jn 18:17 ,
NABRE	John	21	27	) . The First Vatican Council cited these verses in defining that Jesus after his resurrection gave Peter the jurisdiction of supreme shepherd and ruler over the whole flock . - 21:15 More than these : probably “ more than these disciples do ” rather than “ more than you love them ” or “ more than you love these things [ fishing , etc . ] . ” - 21:18 Originally probably a proverb about old age , now used as a figurative reference to the crucifixion of Peter . - 21:22 Until I come : a reference to the parousia . - 21:23 This whole scene takes on more significance if the disciple is already dead . The death of the apostolic generation caused problems in the church because of a belief that Jesus was to have returned first . Loss of faith sometimes resulted ; cf .

NABRE	Romans	1	1	Cor 1:23–24 . Paul affirms , however , that it is precisely through the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus that God ’ s saving will and power become manifest . Jew first ( cf . Rom 2:9–10 ) means that Jews especially , in view of the example of Abraham ( Rom
NABRE	Romans	1	2	Corinthians the thanksgiving becomes a blessing , and in Ephesians it is preceded by a lengthy blessing . Sometimes the thanksgiving is blended into the body of the letter , especially in
NABRE	Romans	1	3	[ c ] the gospel about his Son , descended from David according to the flesh , ( C )
NABRE	Romans	1	4	) , ought to be the leaders in the response of faith . - 1:17 In it is revealed the righteousness of God from faith to faith : the gospel centers in Jesus Christ , in whom God ’ s saving presence and righteousness in history have been made known . Faith is affirmation of the basic purpose and meaning of the Old Testament as proclamation of divine promise ( Rom 1:2 ; 4:13 ) and exposure of the inability of humanity to effect its salvation even through covenant law . Faith is the gift of the holy Spirit and denotes acceptance of salvation as God ’ s righteousness , that is , God ’ s gift of a renewed relationship in forgiveness and power for a new life . Faith is response to God ’ s total claim on people and their destiny . The one who is righteous by faith will live : see note on Hb 2:4 . - 1:18–3:20 Paul aims to show that all humanity is in a desperate plight and requires God ’ s special intervention if it is to be saved . - 1:18–32 In this passage Paul uses themes and rhetoric common in Jewish-Hellenistic mission proclamation ( cf . Wis 13:1–14:31 ) to indict especially the non-Jewish world . The close association of idolatry and immorality is basic , but the generalization needs in all fairness to be balanced against the fact that non-Jewish Christian society on many levels displayed moral attitudes and performance whose quality would challenge much of contemporary Christian culture . Romans themselves expressed abhorrence over devotion accorded to animals in Egypt . Paul ’ s main point is that the wrath of God does not await the end of the world but goes into action at each present moment in humanity ’ s history when misdirected piety serves as a facade for self-interest . - 1:18 The wrath of God : God ’ s reaction to human sinfulness , an Old Testament phrase that expresses the irreconcilable opposition between God and evil ( see Is 9:11 ,

NABRE	Romans	1	20	; 10:4 ; 30:27 ) . It is not contrary to God ’ s universal love for his creatures , but condemns Israel ’ s turning aside from the covenant obligations . Hosea depicts Yahweh as suffering intensely at the thought of having to punish Israel ( Hos 11:8–9 ) . God ’ s wrath was to be poured forth especially on the “ Day of Yahweh ” and thus took on an eschatological connotation ( see Zep 1:15 ) . - 1:24 In order to expose the depth of humanity ’ s rebellion against the Creator , God handed them over to impurity through the lusts of their hearts . Instead of curbing people ’ s evil interests , God abandoned them to self-indulgence , thereby removing the facade of apparent conformity to the divine will . Subsequently Paul will show that the Mosaic law produces the same effect ; cf . Rom 5:20 ; 7:13–24 . The divine judgment expressed here is related to the theme of hardness of heart described in Rom 9:17–18 .

NABRE	Romans	1	22	While claiming to be wise , ( T ) they became fools
NABRE	Romans	1	23	and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for the likeness of an image of mortal man or of birds or of four-legged animals or of snakes . ( U )
NABRE	Romans	1	24	Therefore , God handed them over to impurity through the lusts of their hearts [ o ] for the mutual degradation of their bodies . ( V )

NABRE	Romans	1	27	. - 1:16–17 The principal theme of the letter is salvation through faith . I am not ashamed of the gospel : Paul is not ashamed to proclaim the gospel , despite the criticism that Jews and Gentiles leveled against the proclamation of the crucified savior ; cf .
NABRE	Romans	1	28	And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God , God handed them over to their undiscerning mind to do what is improper .
NABRE	Romans	1	29	( Y ) They are filled with every form of wickedness , evil , greed , and malice ; full of envy , murder , rivalry , treachery , and spite . They are gossips

NABRE	Romans	1	31	They are senseless , faithless , heartless , ruthless .
NABRE	Romans	1	32	Although they know the just decree of God that all who practice such things deserve death , they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them . ( Z ) Footnotes - 1:1–7 In Paul ’ s letters the greeting or praescriptio follows a standard form , though with variations . It is based upon the common Greco-Roman epistolary practice , but with the addition of Semitic and specifically Christian elements . The three basic components are : name of sender ; name of addressee ; greeting . In identifying himself , Paul often adds phrases to describe his apostolic mission ; this element is more developed in Romans than in any other letter . Elsewhere he associates co-workers with himself in the greeting : Sosthenes (

NABRE	Romans	2	2	We know that the judgment of God on those who do such things is true .
NABRE	Romans	2	1	[ a ] Therefore , you are without excuse , ( A ) every one of you who passes judgment . [ b ] For by the standard by which you judge another you condemn yourself , since you , the judge , do the very same things .
NABRE	Romans	2	3	Do you suppose , then , you who judge those who engage in such things and yet do them yourself , that you will escape the judgment of God ? ( B )
NABRE	Romans	2	4	Or do you hold his priceless kindness , forbearance , and patience in low esteem , unaware that the kindness of God would lead you to repentance ? ( C )
NABRE	Romans	2	5	By your stubbornness and impenitent heart , ( D ) you are storing up wrath for yourself for the day of wrath and revelation of the just judgment of God ,
NABRE	Romans	2	6	( E ) who will repay everyone according to his works : [ c ]
NABRE	Romans	2	7	eternal life to those who seek glory , honor , and immortality through perseverance in good works ,

NABRE	Romans	2	9	Yes , affliction and distress will come upon every human being who does evil , Jew first and then Greek .
NABRE	Romans	2	10	( G ) But there will be glory , honor , and peace for everyone who does good , Jew first and then Greek .
NABRE	Romans	2	11	[ d ] ( H ) There is no partiality with God . Judgment by the Interior Law . [ e ]
NABRE	Romans	2	12	All who sin outside the law will also perish without reference to it , and all who sin under the law will be judged in accordance with it . ( I )
NABRE	Romans	2	13	For it is not those who hear the law who are just in the sight of God ; rather , those who observe the law will be justified . ( J )
NABRE	Romans	2	14	For when the Gentiles who do not have the law by nature observe the prescriptions of the law , they are a law for themselves even though they do not have the law . ( K )
NABRE	Romans	2	15	They show that the demands of the law are written in their hearts , [ f ] while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even defend them
NABRE	Romans	2	16	on the day when , according to my gospel , God will judge people ’ s hidden works through Christ Jesus . ( L ) Judgment by the Mosaic Law . [ g ]
NABRE	Romans	2	17	Now if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast of God ( M )
NABRE	Romans	2	18	and know his will and are able to discern what is important since you are instructed from the law , ( N )
NABRE	Romans	2	19	and if you are confident that you are a guide for the blind and a light for those in darkness , ( O )
NABRE	Romans	2	20	that you are a trainer of the foolish and teacher of the simple , ( P ) because in the law you have the formulation of knowledge and truth—
NABRE	Romans	2	21	then you who teach another , are you failing to teach yourself ? You who preach against stealing , do you steal ? ( Q )
NABRE	Romans	2	22	You who forbid adultery , do you commit adultery ? You who detest idols , do you rob temples ?
NABRE	Romans	2	23	You who boast of the law , do you dishonor God by breaking the law ?
NABRE	Romans	2	24	( R ) For , as it is written , “ Because of you the name of God is reviled among the Gentiles. ” [ h ]
NABRE	Romans	2	25	( S ) Circumcision , to be sure , has value if you observe the law ; but if you break the law , your circumcision has become uncircumcision . ( T )
NABRE	Romans	2	26	Again , if an uncircumcised man keeps the precepts of the law , will he not be considered circumcised ? ( U )
NABRE	Romans	2	27	Indeed , those who are physically uncircumcised but carry out the law will pass judgment on you , with your written law and circumcision , who break the law .
NABRE	Romans	2	28	One is not a Jew outwardly . True circumcision is not outward , in the flesh . ( V )
NABRE	Romans	2	29	Rather , one is a Jew inwardly , and circumcision is of the heart , in the spirit , not the letter ; his praise is not from human beings but from God . ( W ) Footnotes - 2:1–3:20 After his general indictment of the Gentile , Paul shows that in spite of special revelation Jews enjoy no advantage in moral status before God ( Rom 3:1–8 ) . With the entire human race now declared guilty before God ( Rom 3:9–20 ) , Paul will then be able to display the solution for the total problem : salvation through God ’ s redemptive work that is revealed in Christ Jesus for all who believe ( Rom 3:21–31 ) . - 2:1–11 As a first step in his demonstration that Jews enjoy no real moral supremacy over Gentiles , Paul explains that the final judgment will be a review of performance , not of privilege . From this perspective Gentiles stand on an equal footing with Jews , and Jews can not condemn the sins of Gentiles without condemning themselves . - 2:6 Will repay everyone according to his works : Paul reproduces the Septuagint text of Ps 62:12 and Prv 24:12 . - 2:11 No partiality with God : this sentence is not at variance with the statements in Rom 2:9–10 . Since Jews are the first to go under indictment , it is only fair that they be given first consideration in the distribution of blessings . Basic , of course , is the understanding that God accepts no bribes ( Dt 10:17 ) . - 2:12–16 Jews can not reasonably demand from Gentiles the standard of conduct inculcated in the Old Testament since God did not address its revelation to them . Rather , God made it possible for Gentiles to know instinctively the difference between right and wrong . But , as Paul explained in Rom 1:18–32 , humanity misread the evidence of God ’ s existence , power , and divinity , and “ while claiming to be wise , they became fools ” ( Rom 1:22 ) . - 2:15 Paul expands on the thought of Jer 31:33 ; Wis 17:11 . - 2:17–29 Mere possession of laws is no evidence of virtue . By eliminating circumcision as an elitist moral sign , Paul clears away the last obstacle to his presentation of justification through faith without claims based on the receipt of circumcision and its attendant legal obligations . - 2:24 According to Is 52:5 the suffering of Israel prompts her enemies to revile God . Paul uses the passage in support of his point that the present immorality of Israelites is the cause of such defamation .

Since “ law ” in Greek may also connote “ custom ” or “ principle , ” his readers and hearers would have sensed no contradiction in the use of the term after the negative statement concerning law in Rom 3:20 . - 3:31 We are supporting the law : giving priority to God ’ s intentions . God is the ultimate source of law , and the essence of law is fairness . On the basis of the Mosaic covenant , God ’ s justice is in question if those who sinned against the law are permitted to go free ( see Rom 3:23–26 ) . In order to rescue all humanity rather than condemn it , God thinks of an alternative : the law or “ principle ” of faith ( Rom 3:27 ) . What can be more fair than to admit everyone into the divine presence on the basis of forgiveness grasped by faith ? Indeed , this principle of faith antedates the Mosaic law , as Paul will demonstrate in Rom
NABRE	Romans	3	24	They are justified freely by his grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus , ( Q )
NABRE	Romans	3	25	whom God set forth as an expiation , [ h ] through faith , by his blood , to prove his righteousness because of the forgiveness of sins previously committed , ( R )
NABRE	Romans	3	26	through the forbearance of God—to prove his righteousness in the present time , that he might be righteous and justify the one who has faith in Jesus .
NABRE	Romans	3	27	( S ) What occasion is there then for boasting ? [ i ] It is ruled out . On what principle , that of works ? No , rather on the principle of faith . [ j ]
NABRE	Romans	3	28	For we consider that a person is justified by faith apart from works of the law . ( T )
NABRE	Romans	3	29	Does God belong to Jews alone ? Does he not belong to Gentiles , too ? Yes , also to Gentiles , ( U )
NABRE	Romans	3	30	for God is one and will justify the circumcised on the basis of faith and the uncircumcised through faith . ( V )
NABRE	Romans	3	31	Are we then annulling the law by this faith ? Of course not ! ( W ) On the contrary , we are supporting the law . [ k ] Footnotes - 3:1–4 In keeping with the popular style of diatribe , Paul responds to the objection that his teaching on the sinfulness of all humanity detracts from the religious prerogatives of Israel . He stresses that Jews have remained the vehicle of God ’ s revelation despite their sins , though this depends on the fidelity of God . - 3:4 Though every human being is a liar : these words reproduce the Greek text of Ps 116:11 . The rest of the verse is from Ps 51:6 . - 3:9–20 Well , then , are we better off ? : this phrase can also be translated “ Are we at a disadvantage ? ” but the latter version does not substantially change the overall meaning of the passage . Having explained that Israel ’ s privileged status is guaranteed by God ’ s fidelity , Paul now demonstrates the infidelity of the Jews by a catena of citations from scripture , possibly derived from an existing collection of testimonia . These texts show that all human beings share the common burden of sin . They are linked together by mention of organs of the body : throat , tongue , lips , mouth , feet , eyes . - 3:19 The law : Paul here uses the term in its broadest sense to mean all of the scriptures ; none of the preceding texts is from the Torah or Pentateuch . - 3:20 No human being will be justified in his sight : these words are freely cited from Ps 143:2 . In place of the psalmist ’ s “ no living person , ” Paul substitutes “ no human being ” ( literally “ no flesh , ” a Hebraism ) , and he adds “ by observing the law. ” - 3:21–31 These verses provide a clear statement of Paul ’ s “ gospel , ” i.e. , the principle of justification by faith in Christ . God has found a means of rescuing humanity from its desperate plight : Paul ’ s general term for this divine initiative is the righteousness of God ( Rom 3:21 ) . Divine mercy declares the guilty innocent and makes them so . God does this not as a result of the law but apart from it ( Rom 3:21 ) , and not because of any merit in human beings but through forgiveness of their sins ( Rom 3:24 ) , in virtue of the redemption wrought in Christ Jesus for all who believe ( Rom 3:22 , 24–25 ) . God has manifested his righteousness in the coming of Jesus Christ , whose saving activity inaugurates a new era in human history . - 3:21 But now : Paul adopts a common phrase used by Greek authors to describe movement from disaster to prosperity . The expressions indicate that Rom 3:21–26 are the consolatory answer to Rom 3:9–20 . - 3:25 Expiation : this rendering is preferable to “ propitiation , ” which suggests hostility on the part of God toward sinners . As Paul will be at pains to point out ( Rom 5:8–10 ) , it is humanity that is hostile to God . - 3:27–31 People can not boast of their own holiness , since it is God ’ s free gift ( Rom 3:27 ) , both to the Jew who practices circumcision out of faith and to the Gentile who accepts faith without the Old Testament religious culture symbolized by circumcision ( Rom 3:29–30 ) . - 3:27 Principle of faith : literally , “ law of faith. ” Paul is fond of wordplay involving the term “ law ” ; cf . Rom 7:21 ,

NABRE	Romans	4	4	A worker ’ s wage is credited not as a gift , but as something due . ( C )
NABRE	Romans	4	1	What then can we say that Abraham found , our ancestor according to the flesh ? ( A )
NABRE	Romans	4	2	[ b ] Indeed , if Abraham was justified on the basis of his works , he has reason to boast ; but this was not so in the sight of God .
NABRE	Romans	4	3	( B ) For what does the scripture say ? “ Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness. ” [ c ]
NABRE	Romans	4	5	But when one does not work , yet believes in the one who justifies the ungodly , his faith is credited as righteousness .
NABRE	Romans	4	6	shows how justification through faith introduces one to the gift of a new life in Christ through the power of the holy Spirit . - 4:9 Blessedness : evidence of divine favor . - 4:15 Law has the negative function of bringing the deep-seated rebellion against God to the surface in specific sins ; see note on Rom 1:18–32 . - 4:20 He did not doubt God ’ s promise in unbelief : any doubts Abraham might have had were resolved in commitment to God ’ s promise . Hb 11:8–12 emphasizes the faith of Abraham and Sarah .

NABRE	Romans	4	7	“ Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven ( D ) and whose sins are covered .
NABRE	Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord does not record. ”
NABRE	Romans	4	9	Does this blessedness [ d ] apply only to the circumcised , or to the uncircumcised as well ? Now we assert that “ faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness. ” ( E )
NABRE	Romans	4	10	Under what circumstances was it credited ? Was he circumcised or not ? He was not circumcised , but uncircumcised .
NABRE	Romans	4	11	And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal on the righteousness received through faith while he was uncircumcised . Thus he was to be the father of all the uncircumcised who believe , so that to them [ also ] righteousness might be credited , ( F )
NABRE	Romans	4	12	as well as the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but also follow the path of faith that our father Abraham walked while still uncircumcised . Inheritance Through Faith .
NABRE	Romans	4	13	It was not through the law that the promise was made to Abraham and his descendants that he would inherit the world , but through the righteousness that comes from faith . ( G )
NABRE	Romans	4	14	For if those who adhere to the law are the heirs , faith is null and the promise is void . ( H )
NABRE	Romans	4	15	For the law produces wrath ; ( I ) but where there is no law , neither is there violation . [ e ]
NABRE	Romans	4	16	For this reason , it depends on faith , so that it may be a gift , and the promise may be guaranteed to all his descendants , not to those who only adhere to the law but to those who follow the faith of Abraham , who is the father of all of us , ( J )
NABRE	Romans	4	17	as it is written , “ I have made you father of many nations. ” He is our father in the sight of God , in whom he believed , who gives life to the dead and calls into being what does not exist . ( K )
NABRE	Romans	4	18	He believed , hoping against hope , ( L ) that he would become “ the father of many nations , ” according to what was said , “ Thus shall your descendants be. ”
NABRE	Romans	4	19	( M ) He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body as [ already ] dead ( for he was almost a hundred years old ) and the dead womb of Sarah .
NABRE	Romans	4	20	He did not doubt God ’ s promise in unbelief ; [ f ] rather , he was empowered by faith and gave glory to God
NABRE	Romans	4	21	and was fully convinced that what he had promised he was also able to do . ( N )
NABRE	Romans	4	22	That is why “ it was credited to him as righteousness. ” ( O )
NABRE	Romans	4	23	But it was not for him alone that it was written that “ it was credited to him ” ;
NABRE	Romans	4	24	it was also for us , to whom it will be credited , who believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead , ( P )
NABRE	Romans	4	25	who was handed over for our transgressions and was raised for our justification . ( Q ) Footnotes - 4:1–25 This is an expanded treatment of the significance of Abraham ’ s faith , which Paul discusses in Gal 3:6–18 ; see notes there . - 4:2–5 Rom 4:2 corresponds to Rom 4:4 , and Rom 4:3–5 . The Greek term here rendered credited means “ made an entry. ” The context determines whether it is credit or debit . Rom 4:8 speaks of “ recording sin ” as a debit . Paul ’ s repeated use of accountants ’ terminology in this and other passages can be traced both to the Old Testament texts he quotes and to his business activity as a tentmaker . The commercial term in Gn 15:6 , “ credited it to him , ” reminds Paul in Rom 4:7–8 of Ps 32:2 , in which the same term is used and applied to forgiveness of sins . Thus Paul is able to argue that Abraham ’ s faith involved receipt of forgiveness of sins and that all believers benefit as he did through faith . - 4:3 Jas 2:24 appears to conflict with Paul ’ s statement . However , James combats the error of extremists who used the doctrine of justification through faith as a screen for moral self-determination . Paul discusses the subject of holiness in greater detail than does James and beginning with Rom

NABRE	Romans	5	5	and hope does not disappoint , because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy Spirit that has been given to us . ( D )
NABRE	Romans	5	1	Therefore , since we have been justified by faith , we have peace [ b ] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ , ( A )
NABRE	Romans	5	2	through whom we have gained access [ by faith ] to this grace in which we stand , and we boast in hope of the glory of God . ( B )
NABRE	Romans	5	3	Not only that , but we even boast of our afflictions , knowing that affliction produces endurance ,
NABRE	Romans	5	4	and endurance , proven character , and proven character , hope , ( C )
NABRE	Romans	5	6	For Christ , while we were still helpless , yet died at the appointed time for the ungodly .
NABRE	Romans	5	7	Indeed , only with difficulty does one die for a just person , though perhaps for a good person one might even find courage to die . [ c ]
NABRE	Romans	5	8	But God proves his love for us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us . ( E )
NABRE	Romans	5	9	How much more then , since we are now justified by his blood , will we be saved through him from the wrath . ( F )
NABRE	Romans	5	10	Indeed , if , while we were enemies , we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son , how much more , once reconciled , will we be saved by his life . ( G )
NABRE	Romans	5	11	Not only that , but we also boast of God through our Lord Jesus Christ , through whom we have now received reconciliation . Humanity ’ s Sin Through Adam .
NABRE	Romans	5	12	[ d ] Therefore , just as through one person sin entered the world , ( H ) and through sin , death , and thus death came to all , inasmuch as all sinned [ e ] —
NABRE	Romans	5	13	for up to the time of the law , sin was in the world , though sin is not accounted when there is no law . ( I )
NABRE	Romans	5	14	But death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over those who did not sin after the pattern of the trespass of Adam , who is the type of the one who was to come . ( J ) Grace and Life Through Christ .
NABRE	Romans	5	15	But the gift is not like the transgression . For if by that one person ’ s transgression the many died , how much more did the grace of God and the gracious gift of the one person Jesus Christ overflow for the many .
NABRE	Romans	5	16	And the gift is not like the result of the one person ’ s sinning . For after one sin there was the judgment that brought condemnation ; but the gift , after many transgressions , brought acquittal .
NABRE	Romans	5	17	For if , by the transgression of one person , death came to reign through that one , how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of justification come to reign in life through the one person Jesus Christ .
NABRE	Romans	5	18	In conclusion , just as through one transgression condemnation came upon all , so through one righteous act acquittal and life came to all . ( K )
NABRE	Romans	5	19	For just as through the disobedience of one person the many were made sinners , so through the obedience of one the many will be made righteous . ( L )
NABRE	Romans	5	20	The law entered in [ f ] so that transgression might increase but , where sin increased , grace overflowed all the more , ( M )
NABRE	Romans	5	21	so that , as sin reigned in death , grace also might reign through justification for eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord . ( N ) Footnotes - 5:1–11 Popular piety frequently construed reverses and troubles as punishment for sin ; cf . Jn 9:2 . Paul therefore assures believers that God ’ s justifying action in Jesus Christ is a declaration of peace . The crucifixion of Jesus Christ displays God ’ s initiative in certifying humanity for unimpeded access into the divine presence . Reconciliation is God ’ s gift of pardon to the entire human race . Through faith one benefits personally from this pardon or , in Paul ’ s term , is justified . The ultimate aim of God is to liberate believers from the pre-Christian self as described in Rom 1–3 . Since this liberation will first find completion in the believer ’ s resurrection , salvation is described as future in Rom 5:10 . Because this fullness of salvation belongs to the future it is called the Christian hope . Paul ’ s Greek term for hope does not , however , suggest a note of uncertainty , to the effect : “ I wonder whether God really means it. ” Rather , God ’ s promise in the gospel fills believers with expectation and anticipation for the climactic gift of unalloyed commitment in the holy Spirit to the performance of the will of God . The persecutions that attend Christian commitment are to teach believers patience and to strengthen this hope , which will not disappoint them because the holy Spirit dwells in their hearts and imbues them with God ’ s love ( Rom 5:5 ) . - 5:1 We have peace : a number of manuscripts , versions , and church Fathers read “ Let us have peace ” ; cf . Rom 14:19 . - 5:7 In the world of Paul ’ s time the good person is especially one who is magnanimous to others . - 5:12–21 Paul reflects on the sin of Adam ( Gn 3:1–13 ) in the light of the redemptive mystery of Christ . Sin , as used in the singular by Paul , refers to the dreadful power that has gripped humanity , which is now in revolt against the Creator and engaged in the exaltation of its own desires and interests . But no one has a right to say , “ Adam made me do it , ” for all are culpable ( Rom 5:12 ) : Gentiles under the demands of the law written in their hearts ( Rom 2:14–15 ) , and Jews under the Mosaic covenant . Through the Old Testament law , the sinfulness of humanity that was operative from the beginning ( Rom 5:13 ) found further stimulation , with the result that sins were generated in even greater abundance . According to Rom 5:15–21 , God ’ s act in Christ is in total contrast to the disastrous effects of the virus of sin that invaded humanity through Adam ’ s crime . - 5:12 Inasmuch as all sinned : others translate “ because all sinned , ” and understand Rom 5:13 as a parenthetical remark . Unlike Wis 2:24 , Paul does not ascribe the entry of death to the devil . - 5:20 The law entered in : sin had made its entrance ( Rom 5:12 ) ; now the law comes in alongside sin . See notes on Rom 1:18–32 ; 5:12–21 . Where sin increased , grace overflowed all the more : Paul declares that grace outmatches the productivity of sin .

NABRE	Romans	6	6	We know that our old self was crucified with him , so that our sinful body might be done away with , that we might no longer be in slavery to sin . ( F )
NABRE	Romans	6	1	[ a ] What then shall we say ? Shall we persist in sin that grace may abound ? Of course not ! ( A )
NABRE	Romans	6	2	How can we who died to sin yet live in it ? ( B )
NABRE	Romans	6	3	Or are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death ? ( C )
NABRE	Romans	6	4	We were indeed buried with him through baptism into death , so that , just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father , we too might live in newness of life . ( D )
NABRE	Romans	6	5	For if we have grown into union with him through a death like his , we shall also be united with him in the resurrection . ( E )
NABRE	Romans	6	7	For a dead person has been absolved from sin .
NABRE	Romans	6	8	If , then , we have died with Christ , we believe that we shall also live with him . ( G )
NABRE	Romans	6	9	We know that Christ , raised from the dead , dies no more ; death no longer has power over him . ( H )
NABRE	Romans	6	10	As to his death , he died to sin once and for all ; as to his life , he lives for God . ( I )
NABRE	Romans	6	11	Consequently , you too must think of yourselves as [ being ] dead to sin and living for God in Christ Jesus . ( J )
NABRE	Romans	6	12	[ b ] Therefore , sin must not reign over your mortal bodies so that you obey their desires . ( K )
NABRE	Romans	6	13	And do not present the parts of your bodies to sin as weapons for wickedness , but present yourselves to God as raised from the dead to life and the parts of your bodies to God as weapons for righteousness . ( L )
NABRE	Romans	6	14	For sin is not to have any power over you , since you are not under the law but under grace . ( M )
NABRE	Romans	6	15	What then ? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace ? Of course not ! ( N )
NABRE	Romans	6	16	Do you not know that if you present yourselves to someone as obedient slaves , ( O ) you are slaves of the one you obey , either of sin , which leads to death , or of obedience , which leads to righteousness ? ( P )
NABRE	Romans	6	17	But thanks be to God that , although you were once slaves of sin , you have become obedient from the heart to the pattern of teaching to which you were entrusted . [ c ]
NABRE	Romans	6	18	Freed from sin , you have become slaves of righteousness .
NABRE	Romans	6	19	I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your nature . For just as you presented the parts of your bodies as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness for lawlessness , so now present them as slaves to righteousness for sanctification .
NABRE	Romans	6	20	( Q ) For when you were slaves of sin , you were free from righteousness . [ d ]
NABRE	Romans	6	21	But what profit did you get then from the things of which you are now ashamed ? For the end of those things is death . ( R )
NABRE	Romans	6	22	But now that you have been freed from sin and have become slaves of God , the benefit that you have leads to sanctification , [ e ] and its end is eternal life . ( S )
NABRE	Romans	6	23	For the wages of sin is death , but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord . ( T ) Footnotes - 6:1–11 To defend the gospel against the charge that it promotes moral laxity ( cf . Rom 3:5–8 ) , Paul expresses himself in the typical style of spirited diatribe . God ’ s display of generosity or grace is not evoked by sin but , as stated in Rom 5:8 is the expression of God ’ s love , and this love pledges eternal life to all believers ( Rom 5:21 ) . Paul views the present conduct of the believers from the perspective of God ’ s completed salvation when the body is resurrected and directed totally by the holy Spirit . Through baptism believers share the death of Christ and thereby escape from the grip of sin . Through the resurrection of Christ the power to live anew becomes reality for them , but the fullness of participation in Christ ’ s resurrection still lies in the future . But life that is lived in dedication to God now is part and parcel of that future . Hence anyone who sincerely claims to be interested in that future will scarcely be able to say , “ Let us sin so that grace may prosper ” ( cf . Rom 6:1 ) . - 6:12–19 Christians have been released from the grip of sin , but sin endeavors to reclaim its victims . The antidote is constant remembrance that divine grace has claimed them and identifies them as people who are alive only for God ’ s interests . - 6:17 In contrast to humanity , which was handed over to self-indulgence ( Rom 1:24–32 ) , believers are entrusted ( “ handed over ” ) to God ’ s pattern of teaching , that is , the new life God aims to develop in Christians through the productivity of the holy Spirit . Throughout this passage Paul uses the slave-master model in order to emphasize the fact that one can not give allegiance to both God and sin . - 6:20 You were free from righteousness : expressed ironically , for such freedom is really tyranny . The commercial metaphors in Rom 6:21–23 add up only one way : sin is a bad bargain . - 6:22 Sanctification : or holiness .

NABRE	Romans	7	7	[ b ] What then can we say ? That the law is sin ? Of course not ! [ c ] Yet I did not know sin except through the law , and I did not know what it is to covet except that the law said , “ You shall not covet. ” ( D )
NABRE	Romans	7	1	Are you unaware , brothers ( for I am speaking to people who know the law ) , that the law has jurisdiction over one as long as one lives ?
NABRE	Romans	7	2	Thus a married woman is bound by law to her living husband ; but if her husband dies , she is released from the law in respect to her husband . ( A )
NABRE	Romans	7	3	Consequently , while her husband is alive she will be called an adulteress if she consorts with another man . But if her husband dies she is free from that law , and she is not an adulteress if she consorts with another man .
NABRE	Romans	7	4	In the same way , my brothers , you also were put to death to the law through the body of Christ , so that you might belong to another , to the one who was raised from the dead in order that we might bear fruit for God .
NABRE	Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh , our sinful passions , awakened by the law , worked in our members to bear fruit for death . ( B )
NABRE	Romans	7	6	But now we are released from the law , dead to what held us captive , so that we may serve in the newness of the spirit and not under the obsolete letter . ( C ) Acquaintance with Sin Through the Law .
NABRE	Romans	7	8	But sin , finding an opportunity in the commandment , produced in me every kind of covetousness . Apart from the law sin is dead . ( E )
NABRE	Romans	7	9	I once lived outside the law , but when the commandment came , sin became alive ;
NABRE	Romans	7	10	then I died , and the commandment that was for life turned out to be death for me . ( F )
NABRE	Romans	7	11	For sin , seizing an opportunity in the commandment , deceived me and through it put me to death . ( G )
NABRE	Romans	7	12	So then the law is holy , and the commandment is holy and righteous and good . ( H ) Sin and Death . [ d ]
NABRE	Romans	7	13	Did the good , then , become death for me ? Of course not ! Sin , in order that it might be shown to be sin , worked death in me through the good , so that sin might become sinful beyond measure through the commandment . ( I )
NABRE	Romans	7	14	We know that the law is spiritual ; but I am carnal , sold into slavery to sin . ( J )
NABRE	Romans	7	15	What I do , I do not understand . For I do not do what I want , but I do what I hate .
NABRE	Romans	7	16	Now if I do what I do not want , I concur that the law is good .
NABRE	Romans	7	17	So now it is no longer I who do it , but sin that dwells in me .
NABRE	Romans	7	18	For I know that good does not dwell in me , that is , in my flesh . The willing is ready at hand , but doing the good is not . ( K )
NABRE	Romans	7	19	For I do not do the good I want , but I do the evil I do not want .
NABRE	Romans	7	20	Now if [ I ] do what I do not want , it is no longer I who do it , but sin that dwells in me .
NABRE	Romans	7	21	So , then , I discover the principle that when I want to do right , evil is at hand .
NABRE	Romans	7	22	For I take delight in the law of God , in my inner self ,
NABRE	Romans	7	23	( L ) but I see in my members another principle at war with the law of my mind , taking me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members . [ e ]
NABRE	Romans	7	24	Miserable one that I am ! Who will deliver me from this mortal body ?
NABRE	Romans	7	25	Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord . Therefore , I myself , with my mind , serve the law of God but , with my flesh , the law of sin . ( M ) Footnotes - 7:1–6 Paul reflects on the fact that Christians have a different understanding of the law because of their faith in Christ . Law binds the living , not the dead , as exemplified in marriage , which binds in life but is dissolved through death . Similarly , Christians who through baptism have died with Christ to sin ( cf . Rom 6:2–4 ) are freed from the law that occasioned transgressions , which in turn were productive of death . Now that Christians are joined to Christ , the power of Christ ’ s resurrection makes it possible for them to bear the fruit of newness of life for God . - 7:7–25 In this passage Paul uses the first person singular in the style of diatribe for the sake of argument . He aims to depict the disastrous consequences when a Christian reintroduces the law as a means to attain the objective of holiness pronounced in Rom 6:22 . - 7:7–12 The apostle defends himself against the charge of identifying the law with sin . Sin does not exist in law but in human beings , whose sinful inclinations are not overcome by the proclamation of law . - 7:13–25 Far from improving the sinner , law encourages sin to expose itself in transgressions or violations of specific commandments ( see Rom 1:24 ; 5:20 ) . Thus persons who do not experience the justifying grace of God , and Christians who revert to dependence on law as the criterion for their relationship with God , will recognize a rift between their reasoned desire for the goodness of the law and their actual performance that is contrary to the law . Unable to free themselves from the slavery of sin and the power of death , they can only be rescued from defeat in the conflict by the power of God ’ s grace working through Jesus Christ . - 7:23 As in Rom 3:27 , Paul plays on the term law , which in Greek can connote custom , system , or principle .

NABRE	Romans	8	8	and those who are in the flesh can not please God . ( F )
NABRE	Romans	8	1	Hence , now there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus .

NABRE	Romans	8	3	For what the law , weakened by the flesh , was powerless to do , this God has done : by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for the sake of sin , he condemned sin in the flesh , ( B )
NABRE	Romans	8	4	so that the righteous decree of the law might be fulfilled in us , who live not according to the flesh but according to the spirit . ( C )
NABRE	Romans	8	5	For those who live according to the flesh are concerned with the things of the flesh , but those who live according to the spirit with the things of the spirit .
NABRE	Romans	8	6	The concern of the flesh is death , but the concern of the spirit is life and peace . ( D )
NABRE	Romans	8	7	against the wrong route to fulfillment of the objective of holiness expressed in Rom 6:22 , Paul points his addressees to the correct way . Through the redemptive work of Christ , Christians have been liberated from the terrible forces of sin and death . Holiness was impossible so long as the flesh ( or our “ old self ” ) , that is , self-interested hostility toward God ( Rom 8:7 ) , frustrated the divine objectives expressed in the law . What is worse , sin used the law to break forth into all manner of lawlessness ( Rom 8:8 ) . All this is now changed . At the cross God broke the power of sin and pronounced sentence on it ( Rom 8:3 ) . Christians still retain the flesh , but it is alien to their new being , which is life in the spirit , namely the new self , governed by the holy Spirit . Under the direction of the holy Spirit Christians are able to fulfill the divine will that formerly found expression in the law ( Rom 8:4 ) . The same Spirit who enlivens Christians for holiness will also resurrect their bodies at the last day ( Rom 8:11 ) . Christian life is therefore the experience of a constant challenge to put to death the evil deeds of the body through life of the spirit ( Rom 8:13 ) . - 8:14–17 Christians , by reason of the Spirit ’ s presence within them , enjoy not only new life but also a new relationship to God , that of adopted children and heirs through Christ , whose sufferings and glory they share . - 8:15 Abba : see note on Mk 14:36 . - 8:18–27 The glory that believers are destined to share with Christ far exceeds the sufferings of the present life . Paul considers the destiny of the created world to be linked with the future that belongs to the believers . As it shares in the penalty of corruption brought about by sin , so also will it share in the benefits of redemption and future glory that comprise the ultimate liberation of God ’ s people ( Rom 8:19–22 ) . After patient endurance in steadfast expectation , the full harvest of the Spirit ’ s presence will be realized . On earth believers enjoy the firstfruits , i.e. , the Spirit , as a guarantee of the total liberation of their bodies from the influence of the rebellious old self ( Rom 8:23 ) . - 8:28–30 These verses outline the Christian vocation as it was designed by God : to be conformed to the image of his Son , who is to be the firstborn among many brothers ( Rom 8:29 ) . God ’ s redemptive action on behalf of the believers has been in process before the beginning of the world . Those whom God chooses are those he foreknew ( Rom 8:29 ) or elected . Those who are called ( Rom 8:30 ) are predestined or predetermined . These expressions do not mean that God is arbitrary . Rather , Paul uses them to emphasize the thought and care that God has taken for the Christian ’ s salvation . - 8:28 We know that all things work for good for those who love God : a few ancient authorities have God as the subject of the verb , and some translators render : “ We know that God makes everything work for good for those who love God…. ” - 8:29 Image : while man and woman were originally created in God ’ s image ( Gn 1:26–27 ) , it is through baptism into Christ , the image of God (
NABRE	Romans	8	9	But you are not in the flesh ; on the contrary , you are in the spirit , if only the Spirit of God dwells in you . Whoever does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him . ( G )
NABRE	Romans	8	10	But if Christ is in you , although the body is dead because of sin , the spirit is alive because of righteousness . ( H )
NABRE	Romans	8	11	If the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you , the one who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also , through his Spirit that dwells in you .
NABRE	Romans	8	12	Consequently , brothers , we are not debtors to the flesh , to live according to the flesh .
NABRE	Romans	8	13	For if you live according to the flesh , you will die , but if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body , you will live . ( I ) Children of God Through Adoption . [ b ]
NABRE	Romans	8	14	For those who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God . ( J )
NABRE	Romans	8	15	For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear , but you received a spirit of adoption , through which we cry , “ Abba , [ c ] Father ! ” ( K )
NABRE	Romans	8	16	The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God , ( L )
NABRE	Romans	8	17	and if children , then heirs , heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ , if only we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified with him . ( M ) Destiny of Glory . [ d ]
NABRE	Romans	8	18	I consider that the sufferings of this present time are as nothing compared with the glory to be revealed for us . ( N )
NABRE	Romans	8	19	For creation awaits with eager expectation the revelation of the children of God ;
NABRE	Romans	8	20	for creation was made subject to futility , not of its own accord but because of the one who subjected it , ( O ) in hope
NABRE	Romans	8	21	that creation itself would be set free from slavery to corruption and share in the glorious freedom of the children of God . ( P )
NABRE	Romans	8	22	We know that all creation is groaning in labor pains even until now ; ( Q )
NABRE	Romans	8	23	and not only that , but we ourselves , who have the firstfruits of the Spirit , we also groan within ourselves as we wait for adoption , the redemption of our bodies . ( R )
NABRE	Romans	8	24	For in hope we were saved . Now hope that sees for itself is not hope . For who hopes for what one sees ? ( S )
NABRE	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for what we do not see , we wait with endurance .
NABRE	Romans	8	26	In the same way , the Spirit too comes to the aid of our weakness ; for we do not know how to pray as we ought , but the Spirit itself intercedes with inexpressible groanings .
NABRE	Romans	8	27	And the one who searches hearts knows what is the intention of the Spirit , because it intercedes for the holy ones according to God ’ s will . ( T ) God ’ s Indomitable Love in Christ .
NABRE	Romans	8	28	[ e ] We know that all things work for good for those who love God , [ f ] who are called according to his purpose . ( U )
NABRE	Romans	8	29	[ g ] For those he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son , so that he might be the firstborn among many brothers . ( V )
NABRE	Romans	8	30	And those he predestined he also called ; and those he called he also justified ; and those he justified he also glorified . ( W )
NABRE	Romans	8	31	[ h ] What then shall we say to this ? If God is for us , who can be against us ? ( X )
NABRE	Romans	8	32	He who did not spare his own Son but handed him over for us all , how will he not also give us everything else along with him ? ( Y )
NABRE	Romans	8	33	Who will bring a charge against God ’ s chosen ones ? It is God who acquits us . ( Z )
NABRE	Romans	8	34	Who will condemn ? It is Christ [ Jesus ] who died , rather , was raised , who also is at the right hand of God , who indeed intercedes for us . ( AA )
NABRE	Romans	8	35	What will separate us from the love of Christ ? Will anguish , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or the sword ?
NABRE	Romans	8	36	As it is written : ( AB ) “ For your sake we are being slain all the day ; we are looked upon as sheep to be slaughtered. ”
NABRE	Romans	8	37	No , in all these things we conquer overwhelmingly through him who loved us . ( AC )
NABRE	Romans	8	38	For I am convinced that neither death , nor life , nor angels , nor principalities , nor present things , [ i ] nor future things , nor powers , ( AD )
NABRE	Romans	8	39	nor height , nor depth , [ j ] nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord . Footnotes - 8:1–13 After his warning in Rom

NABRE	Romans	9	9	For this is the wording of the promise , “ About this time I shall return and Sarah will have a son. ” ( H )
NABRE	Romans	9	1	I speak the truth in Christ , I do not lie ; my conscience joins with the holy Spirit in bearing me witness ( A )
NABRE	Romans	9	2	that I have great sorrow and constant anguish in my heart .
NABRE	Romans	9	3	For I could wish that I myself were accursed and separated from Christ for the sake of my brothers , my kin according to the flesh . ( B )
NABRE	Romans	9	4	They are Israelites ; theirs the adoption , the glory , the covenants , the giving of the law , the worship , and the promises ; ( C )
NABRE	Romans	9	5	theirs the patriarchs , and from them , according to the flesh , is the Messiah . God who is over all [ c ] be blessed forever . Amen . ( D ) God ’ s Free Choice .
NABRE	Romans	9	6	But it is not that the word of God has failed . For not all who are of Israel are Israel , ( E )
NABRE	Romans	9	7	nor are they all children of Abraham because they are his descendants ; but “ It is through Isaac that descendants shall bear your name. ” ( F )
NABRE	Romans	9	8	This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God , but the children of the promise are counted as descendants . ( G )
NABRE	Romans	9	10	And not only that , ( I ) but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one husband , our father Isaac [ d ] —
NABRE	Romans	9	11	before they had yet been born or had done anything , good or bad , in order that God ’ s elective plan might continue ,
NABRE	Romans	9	12	not by works but by his call—she was told , “ The older shall serve the younger. ” ( J )
NABRE	Romans	9	13	As it is written : ( K ) “ I loved Jacob but hated Esau. ” [ e ]
NABRE	Romans	9	14	[ f ] What then are we to say ? Is there injustice on the part of God ? Of course not ! ( L )
NABRE	Romans	9	15	For he says to Moses : “ I will show mercy to whom I will , I will take pity on whom I will. ” ( M )
NABRE	Romans	9	16	So it depends not upon a person ’ s will or exertion , but upon God , who shows mercy . ( N )
NABRE	Romans	9	17	For the scripture says to Pharaoh , “ This is why I have raised you up , to show my power through you that my name may be proclaimed throughout the earth. ” ( O )
NABRE	Romans	9	18	Consequently , he has mercy upon whom he wills , ( P ) and he hardens whom he wills . [ g ]
NABRE	Romans	9	19	[ h ] You will say to me then , “ Why [ then ] does he still find fault ? For who can oppose his will ? ” ( Q )
NABRE	Romans	9	20	But who indeed are you , a human being , to talk back to God ? ( R ) Will what is made say to its maker , “ Why have you created me so ? ”
NABRE	Romans	9	21	Or does not the potter have a right over the clay , to make out of the same lump one vessel for a noble purpose and another for an ignoble one ?
NABRE	Romans	9	22	What if God , wishing to show his wrath and make known his power , has endured with much patience the vessels of wrath made for destruction ? ( S )
NABRE	Romans	9	23	This was to make known the riches of his glory to the vessels of mercy , which he has prepared previously for glory ,
NABRE	Romans	9	24	namely , us whom he has called , not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles . Witness of the Prophets .
NABRE	Romans	9	25	As indeed he says in Hosea : “ Those who were not my people I will call ‘ my people , ’ and her who was not beloved [ i ] I will call ‘ beloved. ’ ( T )
NABRE	Romans	9	26	And in the very place where it was said to them , ‘ You are not my people , ’ there they shall be called children of the living God. ” ( U )
NABRE	Romans	9	27	( V ) And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel , “ Though the number of the Israelites were like the sand of the sea , only a remnant will be saved ;
NABRE	Romans	9	28	for decisively and quickly will the Lord execute sentence upon the earth. ”
NABRE	Romans	9	29	And as Isaiah predicted : “ Unless the Lord of hosts had left us descendants , we would have become like Sodom and have been made like Gomorrah. ” ( W ) Righteousness Based on Faith . [ j ]
NABRE	Romans	9	30	What then shall we say ? That Gentiles , who did not pursue righteousness , have achieved it , that is , righteousness that comes from faith ; ( X )
NABRE	Romans	9	31	but that Israel , who pursued the law of righteousness , did not attain to that law ? ( Y )
NABRE	Romans	9	32	Why not ? Because they did it not by faith , but as if it could be done by works . ( Z ) They stumbled over the stone that causes stumbling , [ k ]
NABRE	Romans	9	33	as it is written : “ Behold , I am laying a stone in Zion that will make people stumble and a rock that will make them fall , and whoever believes in him shall not be put to shame. ” ( AA ) Footnotes - 9:1–11:36 Israel ’ s unbelief and its rejection of Jesus as savior astonished and puzzled Christians . It constituted a serious problem for them in view of God ’ s specific preparation of Israel for the advent of the Messiah . Paul addresses himself here to the essential question of how the divine plan could be frustrated by Israel ’ s unbelief . At the same time , he discourages both complacency and anxiety on the part of Gentiles . To those who might boast of their superior advantage over Jews , he warns that their enjoyment of the blessings assigned to Israel can be terminated . To those who might anxiously ask , “ How can we be sure that Israel ’ s fate will not be ours ? ” he replies that only unbelief can deprive one of salvation . - 9:1–5 The apostle speaks in strong terms of the depth of his grief over the unbelief of his own people . He would willingly undergo a curse himself for the sake of their coming to the knowledge of Christ ( Rom 9:3 ; cf . Lv 27:28–29 ) . His love for them derives from God ’ s continuing choice of them and from the spiritual benefits that God bestows on them and through them on all of humanity ( Rom 9:4–5 ) . - 9:5 Some editors punctuate this verse differently and prefer the translation , “ Of whom is Christ according to the flesh , who is God over all. ” However , Paul ’ s point is that God who is over all aimed to use Israel , which had been entrusted with every privilege , in outreach to the entire world through the Messiah . - 9:10 Children by one husband , our father Isaac : Abraham had two children , Ishmael and Isaac , by two wives , Hagar and Sarah , respectively . In that instance Isaac , although born later than Ishmael , became the bearer of the messianic promise . In the case of twins born to Rebecca , God ’ s elective procedure is seen even more dramatically , and again the younger , contrary to Semitic custom , is given the preference . - 9:13 The literal rendering , “ Jacob I loved , but Esau I hated , ” suggests an attitude of divine hostility that is not implied in Paul ’ s statement . In Semitic usage “ hate ” means to love less ; cf . Lk 14:26 with Mt 10:37 . Israel ’ s unbelief reflects the mystery of the divine election that is always operative within it . Mere natural descent from Abraham does not ensure the full possession of the divine gifts ; it is God ’ s sovereign prerogative to bestow this fullness upon , or to withhold it from , whomsoever he wishes ; cf . Mt 3:9 ; Jn 8:39 . The choice of Jacob over Esau is a case in point . - 9:14–18 The principle of divine election does not invite Christians to theoretical inquiry concerning the nonelected , nor does this principle mean that God is unfair in his dealings with humanity . The instruction concerning divine election is a part of the gospel and reveals that the gift of faith is the enactment of God ’ s mercy ( Rom 9:16 ) . God raised up Moses to display that mercy , and Pharaoh to display divine severity in punishing those who obstinately oppose their Creator . - 9:18 The basic biblical principle is : those who will not see or hear shall not see or hear . On the other hand , the same God who thus makes stubborn or hardens the heart can reconstruct it through the work of the holy Spirit . - 9:19–29 The apostle responds to the objection that if God rules over faith through the principle of divine election , God can not then accuse unbelievers of sin ( Rom 9:19 ) . For Paul , this objection is in the last analysis a manifestation of human insolence , and his “ answer ” is less an explanation of God ’ s ways than the rejection of an argument that places humanity on a level with God . At the same time , Paul shows that God is far less arbitrary than appearances suggest , for God endures with much patience ( Rom 9:22 ) a person like the Pharaoh of the Exodus . - 9:25 Beloved : in Semitic discourse means “ preferred ” or “ favorite ” ( cf . Rom 9:13 ) . See Hos 2:1 . - 9:30–33 In the conversion of the Gentiles and , by contrast , of relatively few Jews , the Old Testament prophecies are seen to be fulfilled ; cf . Rom 9:25–29 . Israel feared that the doctrine of justification through faith would jeopardize the validity of the Mosaic law , and so they never reached their goal of righteousness that they had sought to attain through meticulous observance of the law ( Rom 9:31 ) . Since Gentiles , including especially Greeks and Romans , had a great regard for righteousness , Paul ’ s statement concerning Gentiles in Rom 9:30 is to be understood from a Jewish perspective : quite evidently they had not been interested in “ God ’ s ” righteousness , for it had not been revealed to them ; but now in response to the proclamation of the gospel they respond in faith . - 9:32 Paul discusses Israel as a whole from the perspective of contemporary Jewish rejection of Jesus as Messiah . The Old Testament and much of Jewish noncanonical literature in fact reflect a fervent faith in divine mercy .

NABRE	Romans	10	2	I testify with regard to them that they have zeal for God , but it is not discerning . ( B )
NABRE	Romans	10	3	For , in their unawareness of the righteousness that comes from God and their attempt to establish their own [ righteousness ] , they did not submit to the righteousness of God . ( C )
NABRE	Romans	10	4	For Christ is the end [ b ] of the law for the justification of everyone who has faith . ( D )
NABRE	Romans	10	5	[ c ] Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from [ the ] law , “ The one who does these things will live by them. ” ( E )
NABRE	Romans	10	6	derive from Moses , but Paul wishes to contrast the language of law and the language of faith . - 10:7 Here Paul blends Dt 30:13 and Ps 107:26 . - 10:9–11 To confess Jesus as Lord was frequently quite hazardous in the first century ( cf . Mt 10:18 ;
NABRE	Romans	10	7	[ d ] or ‘ Who will go down into the abyss ? ’ ( that is , to bring Christ up from the dead ) . ” ( G )
NABRE	Romans	10	8	But what does it say ? “ The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart ” ( H ) ( that is , the word of faith that we preach ) ,
NABRE	Romans	10	9	for , if you confess [ e ] with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved . ( I )
NABRE	Romans	10	11	For the scripture says , “ No one who believes in him will be put to shame. ” ( J )
NABRE	Romans	10	12	For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek ; the same Lord is Lord of all , enriching all who call upon him . ( K )
NABRE	Romans	10	13	For “ everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. ” ( L )
NABRE	Romans	10	14	[ f ] But how can they call on him in whom they have not believed ? And how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? And how can they hear without someone to preach ? ( M )
NABRE	Romans	10	15	And how can people preach unless they are sent ? As it is written , ( N ) “ How beautiful are the feet of those who bring [ the ] good news ! ” [ g ]
NABRE	Romans	10	16	But not everyone has heeded the good news ; for Isaiah says , “ Lord , who has believed what was heard from us ? ” ( O )
NABRE	Romans	10	17	Thus faith comes from what is heard , and what is heard comes through the word of Christ . ( P )
NABRE	Romans	10	18	But I ask , did they not hear ? Certainly they did ; for “ Their voice has gone forth to all the earth , and their words to the ends of the world. ” ( Q )
NABRE	Romans	10	19	But I ask , did not Israel understand ? ( R ) First Moses says : “ I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation ; with a senseless nation I will make you angry. ”
NABRE	Romans	10	20	( S ) Then Isaiah speaks boldly and says : “ I was found [ by ] those who were not seeking me ; I revealed myself to those who were not asking for me. ”
NABRE	Romans	10	21	But regarding Israel he says , “ All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contentious people. ” Footnotes - 10:1–13 Despite Israel ’ s lack of faith in God ’ s act in Christ , Paul does not abandon hope for her salvation ( Rom 10:1 ) . However , Israel must recognize that the Messiah ’ s arrival in the person of Jesus Christ means the termination of the Mosaic law as the criterion for understanding oneself in a valid relationship to God . Faith in God ’ s saving action in Jesus Christ takes precedence over any such legal claim ( Rom 10:6 ) . - 10:4 The Mosaic legislation has been superseded by God ’ s action in Jesus Christ . Others understand end here in the sense that Christ is the goal of the law , i.e. , the true meaning of the Mosaic law , which can not be correctly understood apart from him . Still others believe that both meanings are intended . - 10:5–6 The subject of the verb says ( Rom 10:6 ) is righteousness personified . Both of the statements in Rom 10:5 ,

The conclusion of Rom 11:32 repeats the thought of Rom 5:20 , “ Where sin increased , grace overflowed all the more. ” - 11:33–36 This final reflection celebrates the wisdom of God ’ s plan of salvation . As Paul has indicated throughout these chapters , both Jew and Gentile , despite the religious recalcitrance of each , have received the gift of faith . The methods used by God in making this outreach to the world stagger human comprehension but are at the same time a dazzling invitation to abiding faith . - 11:34 The citation is from the Greek text of Is 40:13 . Paul does not explicitly mention Isaiah in this verse , nor Job in Rom 11:35 . - 11:35 Paul quotes from an old Greek version of Jb 41:3a , which differs from the Hebrew text ( Jb 41:11a ) .

NABRE	Romans	11	2	God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew . Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah , how he pleads with God against Israel ?
NABRE	Romans	11	3	“ Lord , they have killed your prophets , they have torn down your altars , and I alone am left , and they are seeking my life. ” ( C )
NABRE	Romans	11	4	But what is God ’ s response to him ? “ I have left for myself seven thousand men who have not knelt to Baal. ” ( D )
NABRE	Romans	11	5	So also at the present time there is a remnant , chosen by grace . ( E )
NABRE	Romans	11	6	But if by grace , it is no longer because of works ; otherwise grace would no longer be grace . ( F )
NABRE	Romans	11	7	What then ? What Israel was seeking it did not attain , but the elect attained it ; the rest were hardened , ( G )
NABRE	Romans	11	8	as it is written : “ God gave them a spirit of deep sleep , eyes that should not see and ears that should not hear , down to this very day. ” ( H )
NABRE	Romans	11	9	And David says : ( I ) “ Let their table become a snare and a trap , a stumbling block and a retribution for them ;
NABRE	Romans	11	10	let their eyes grow dim so that they may not see , and keep their backs bent forever. ” The Gentiles ’ Salvation .
NABRE	Romans	11	12	Now if their transgression is enrichment for the world , and if their diminished number is enrichment for the Gentiles , how much more their full number .
NABRE	Romans	11	13	Now I am speaking to you Gentiles . Inasmuch then as I am the apostle to the Gentiles , I glory in my ministry ( K )
NABRE	Romans	11	14	in order to make my race jealous and thus save some of them .
NABRE	Romans	11	15	For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world , what will their acceptance be but life from the dead ?
NABRE	Romans	11	16	[ c ] If the firstfruits are holy , so is the whole batch of dough ; and if the root is holy , so are the branches . ( L )
NABRE	Romans	11	17	But if some of the branches were broken off , and you , a wild olive shoot , were grafted in their place and have come to share in the rich root of the olive tree , ( M )
NABRE	Romans	11	18	do not boast against the branches . If you do boast , consider that you do not support the root ; the root supports you . ( N )
NABRE	Romans	11	19	Indeed you will say , “ Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in. ”
NABRE	Romans	11	20	That is so . They were broken off because of unbelief , but you are there because of faith . So do not become haughty , but stand in awe . ( O )
NABRE	Romans	11	21	For if God did not spare the natural branches , [ perhaps ] he will not spare you either . ( P )
NABRE	Romans	11	22	See , then , the kindness and severity of God : severity toward those who fell , but God ’ s kindness to you , provided you remain in his kindness ; otherwise you too will be cut off . ( Q )
NABRE	Romans	11	23	And they also , if they do not remain in unbelief , will be grafted in , for God is able to graft them in again . ( R )
NABRE	Romans	11	24	For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree , and grafted , contrary to nature , into a cultivated one , how much more will they who belong to it by nature be grafted back into their own olive tree . God ’ s Irrevocable Call . [ d ]
NABRE	Romans	11	25	I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery , brothers , so that you will not become wise [ in ] your own estimation : a hardening has come upon Israel in part , until the full number of the Gentiles comes in , ( S )
NABRE	Romans	11	26	and thus all Israel will be saved , ( T ) as it is written : ( U ) “ The deliverer will come out of Zion , he will turn away godlessness from Jacob ;
NABRE	Romans	11	27	and this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins. ” ( V )
NABRE	Romans	11	28	In respect to the gospel , they are enemies on your account ; but in respect to election , they are beloved because of the patriarchs . ( W )
NABRE	Romans	11	29	For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable . ( X ) Triumph of God ’ s Mercy .
NABRE	Romans	11	30	[ e ] Just as you once disobeyed God but have now received mercy because of their disobedience ,
NABRE	Romans	11	31	so they have now disobeyed in order that , by virtue of the mercy shown to you , they too may [ now ] receive mercy .
NABRE	Romans	11	32	For God delivered all to disobedience , that he might have mercy upon all . ( Y )
NABRE	Romans	11	33	[ f ] Oh , the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God ! How inscrutable are his judgments and how unsearchable his ways ! ( Z )
NABRE	Romans	11	34	“ For who has known the mind of the Lord [ g ] or who has been his counselor ? ” ( AA )
NABRE	Romans	11	35	[ h ] “ Or who has given him anything ( AB ) that he may be repaid ? ”
NABRE	Romans	11	36	For from him and through him and for him are all things . To him be glory forever . Amen . ( AC ) Footnotes - 11:1–10 Although Israel has been unfaithful to the prophetic message of the gospel ( Rom 10:14–21 ) , God remains faithful to Israel . Proof of the divine fidelity lies in the existence of Jewish Christians like Paul himself . The unbelieving Jews , says Paul , have been blinded by the Christian teaching concerning the Messiah . - 11:11–15 The unbelief of the Jews has paved the way for the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles and for their easier acceptance of it outside the context of Jewish culture . Through his mission to the Gentiles Paul also hopes to fill his fellow Jews with jealousy . Hence he hastens to fill the entire Mediterranean world with the gospel . Once all the Gentile nations have heard the gospel , Israel as a whole is expected to embrace it . This will be tantamount to resurrection of the dead , that is , the reappearance of Jesus Christ with all the believers at the end of time . - 11:16–24 Israel remains holy in the eyes of God and stands as a witness to the faith described in the Old Testament because of the firstfruits ( or the first piece baked ) ( Rom 11:16 ) , that is , the converted remnant , and the root that is holy , that is , the patriarchs ( Rom 11:16 ) . The Jews ’ failure to believe in Christ is a warning to Gentile Christians to be on guard against any semblance of anti-Jewish arrogance , that is , failure to recognize their total dependence on divine grace . - 11:25–29 In God ’ s design , Israel ’ s unbelief is being used to grant the light of faith to the Gentiles . Meanwhile , Israel remains dear to God ( cf . Rom 9:13 ) , still the object of special providence , the mystery of which will one day be revealed . - 11:30–32 Israel , together with the Gentiles who have been handed over to all manner of vices ( Rom

NABRE	Romans	12	12	Rejoice in hope , endure in affliction , persevere in prayer . ( I )
NABRE	Romans	12	1	Cor 12:12–27 . - 12:6 Everyone has some gift that can be used for the benefit of the community . When the instruction on justification through faith is correctly grasped , the possessor of a gift will understand that it is not an instrument of self-aggrandizement . Possession of a gift is not an index to quality of faith . Rather , the gift is a challenge to faithful use . - 12:8 Over others : usually taken to mean “ rule over ” but possibly “ serve as a patron. ” Wealthier members in Greco-Roman communities were frequently asked to assist in public service projects . In view of the references to contributing in generosity and to acts of mercy , Paul may have in mind people like Phoebe ( Rom 16:1–2 ) , who is called a benefactor ( or “ patron ” ) because of the services she rendered to many Christians , including Paul . - 12:14–21 Since God has justified the believers , it is not necessary for them to take justice into their own hands by taking vengeance . God will ultimately deal justly with all , including those who inflict injury on the believers . This question of personal rights as a matter of justice prepares the way for more detailed consideration of the state as adjudicator .

NABRE	Romans	12	2	Do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the renewal of your mind , that you may discern what is the will of God , what is good and pleasing and perfect . ( B ) Many Parts in One Body .
NABRE	Romans	12	3	( C ) For by the grace given to me I tell everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than one ought to think , but to think soberly , each according to the measure of faith that God has apportioned .
NABRE	Romans	12	4	( D ) For as in one body we have many parts , and all the parts do not have the same function ,
NABRE	Romans	12	5	so we , though many , are one body in Christ [ c ] and individually parts of one another .
NABRE	Romans	12	6	( E ) Since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us , let us exercise them : [ d ] if prophecy , in proportion to the faith ;
NABRE	Romans	12	7	if ministry , in ministering ; if one is a teacher , in teaching ;
NABRE	Romans	12	8	if one exhorts , in exhortation ; if one contributes , in generosity ; if one is over others , [ e ] with diligence ; if one does acts of mercy , with cheerfulness . Mutual Love .
NABRE	Romans	12	9	Let love be sincere ; hate what is evil , hold on to what is good ; ( F )
NABRE	Romans	12	10	love one another with mutual affection ; anticipate one another in showing honor . ( G )
NABRE	Romans	12	11	Do not grow slack in zeal , be fervent in spirit , serve the Lord . ( H )
NABRE	Romans	12	13	Contribute to the needs of the holy ones , ( J ) exercise hospitality .
NABRE	Romans	12	14	[ f ] Bless those who persecute [ you ] , ( K ) bless and do not curse them . ( L )
NABRE	Romans	12	15	Rejoice with those who rejoice , weep with those who weep . ( M )
NABRE	Romans	12	16	Have the same regard for one another ; do not be haughty but associate with the lowly ; do not be wise in your own estimation . ( N )
NABRE	Romans	12	17	Do not repay anyone evil for evil ; be concerned for what is noble in the sight of all . ( O )
NABRE	Romans	12	18	If possible , on your part , live at peace with all . ( P )
NABRE	Romans	12	19	Beloved , do not look for revenge but leave room for the wrath ; for it is written , “ Vengeance is mine , I will repay , says the Lord. ” ( Q )
NABRE	Romans	12	20	Rather , “ if your enemy is hungry , feed him ; if he is thirsty , give him something to drink ; for by so doing you will heap burning coals upon his head. ” ( R )
NABRE	Romans	12	21	Do not be conquered by evil but conquer evil with good . Footnotes - 12:1–13:14 Since Christ marks the termination of the Mosaic law as the primary source of guidance for God ’ s people ( Rom 10:4 ) , the apostle explains how Christians can function , in the light of the gift of justification through faith , in their relation to one another and the state . - 12:1–8 The Mosaic code included elaborate directions on sacrifices and other cultic observances . The gospel , however , invites believers to present their bodies as a living sacrifice ( Rom 12:1 ) . Instead of being limited by specific legal maxims , Christians are liberated for the exercise of good judgment as they are confronted with the many and varied decisions required in the course of daily life . To assist them , God distributes a variety of gifts to the fellowship of believers , including those of prophecy , teaching , and exhortation ( Rom 12:6–8 ) . Prophets assist the community to understand the will of God as it applies to the present situation ( Rom 12:6 ) . Teachers help people to understand themselves and their responsibilities in relation to others ( Rom 12:7 ) . One who exhorts offers encouragement to the community to exercise their faith in the performance of all that is pleasing to God ( Rom 12:8 ) . Indeed , this very section , beginning with Rom 12:1 , is a specimen of Paul ’ s own style of exhortation . - 12:5 One body in Christ : on the church as the body of Christ , see

NABRE	Romans	13	13	let us conduct ourselves properly as in the day , [ d ] not in orgies and drunkenness , not in promiscuity and licentiousness , not in rivalry and jealousy . ( K )
NABRE	Romans	13	1	Let every person be subordinate to the higher authorities , for there is no authority except from God , and those that exist have been established by God . ( A )
NABRE	Romans	13	2	Therefore , whoever resists authority opposes what God has appointed , and those who oppose it will bring judgment upon themselves .
NABRE	Romans	13	3	For rulers are not a cause of fear to good conduct , but to evil . ( B ) Do you wish to have no fear of authority ? Then do what is good and you will receive approval from it ,
NABRE	Romans	13	4	for it is a servant of God for your good . But if you do evil , be afraid , for it does not bear the sword without purpose ; it is the servant of God to inflict wrath on the evildoer . ( C )
NABRE	Romans	13	5	Therefore , it is necessary to be subject not only because of the wrath but also because of conscience . ( D )
NABRE	Romans	13	6	This is why you also pay taxes , for the authorities are ministers of God , devoting themselves to this very thing .
NABRE	Romans	13	7	Pay to all their dues , taxes to whom taxes are due , toll to whom toll is due , respect to whom respect is due , honor to whom honor is due . ( E ) Love Fulfills the Law . [ b ]
NABRE	Romans	13	8	Owe nothing to anyone , except to love one another ; for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law . ( F )
NABRE	Romans	13	9	The commandments , “ You shall not commit adultery ; you shall not kill ; you shall not steal ; you shall not covet , ” and whatever other commandment there may be , are summed up in this saying , [ namely ] “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ” ( G )
NABRE	Romans	13	10	Love does no evil to the neighbor ; hence , love is the fulfillment of the law . ( H ) Awareness of the End of Time . [ c ]
NABRE	Romans	13	11	And do this because you know the time ; it is the hour now for you to awake from sleep . For our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed ; ( I )
NABRE	Romans	13	12	the night is advanced , the day is at hand . Let us then throw off the works of darkness [ and ] put on the armor of light ; ( J )
NABRE	Romans	13	14	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make no provision for the desires of the flesh . ( L ) Footnotes - 13:1–7 Paul must come to grips with the problem raised by a message that declares people free from the law . How are they to relate to Roman authority ? The problem was exacerbated by the fact that imperial protocol was interwoven with devotion to various deities . Paul builds on the traditional instruction exhibited in Wis 6:1–3 , according to which kings and magistrates rule by consent of God . From this perspective , then , believers who render obedience to the governing authorities are obeying the one who is highest in command . At the same time , it is recognized that Caesar has the responsibility to make just ordinances and to commend uprightness ; cf . Wis 6:4–21 . That Caesar is not entitled to obedience when such obedience would nullify God ’ s prior claim to the believers ’ moral decision becomes clear in the light of the following verses . - 13:8–10 When love directs the Christian ’ s moral decisions , the interest of law in basic concerns , such as familial relationships , sanctity of life , and security of property , is safeguarded ( Rom 13:9 ) . Indeed , says Paul , the same applies to any other commandment ( Rom 13:9 ) , whether one in the Mosaic code or one drawn up by local magistrates under imperial authority . Love anticipates the purpose of public legislation , namely , to secure the best interests of the citizenry . Since Caesar ’ s obligation is to punish the wrongdoer ( Rom 13:4 ) , the Christian who acts in love is free from all legitimate indictment . - 13:11–14 These verses provide the motivation for the love that is encouraged in Rom 13:8–10 . - 13:13 Let us conduct ourselves properly as in the day : the behavior described in Rom 1:29–30 is now to be reversed . Secular moralists were fond of making references to people who could not wait for nightfall to do their carousing . Paul says that Christians claim to be people of the new day that will dawn with the return of Christ . Instead of planning for nighttime behavior they should be concentrating on conduct that is consonant with avowed interest in the Lord ’ s return .

NABRE	Romans	14	2	One person believes that one may eat anything , while the weak person eats only vegetables . ( C )

NABRE	Romans	14	6	Whoever observes the day , observes it for the Lord . Also whoever eats , eats for the Lord , since he gives thanks to God ; while whoever abstains , abstains for the Lord and gives thanks to God .

NABRE	Romans	14	10	. - 14:5 Since the problem to be overcome was humanity ’ s perverted mind or judgment ( Rom 1:28 ) , Paul indicates that the mind of the Christian is now able to function with appropriate discrimination ( cf . Rom 12:2 ) . - 14:8 The Lord : Jesus , our Master . The same Greek word , kyrios , was applied to both rulers and holders of slaves . Throughout the Letter to the Romans Paul emphasizes God ’ s total claim on the believer ; see note on Rom 1:1 . - 14:19 Some manuscripts , versions , and church Fathers read , “ We then pursue… ” ; cf . Rom 5:1 . - 14:23 Whatever is not from faith is sin : Paul does not mean that all the actions of unbelievers are sinful . He addresses himself to the question of intracommunity living . Sin in the singular is the dreadful power described in Rom 5:12–14 .

NABRE	Romans	14	13	Then let us no longer judge one another , but rather resolve never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother . ( L )
NABRE	Romans	14	15	If your brother is being hurt by what you eat , your conduct is no longer in accord with love . Do not because of your food destroy him for whom Christ died . ( N )
NABRE	Romans	14	16	So do not let your good be reviled . ( O )
NABRE	Romans	14	17	For the kingdom of God is not a matter of food and drink , but of righteousness , peace , and joy in the holy Spirit ; ( P )
NABRE	Romans	14	18	whoever serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by others .
NABRE	Romans	14	19	Let us [ d ] then pursue what leads to peace and to building up one another . ( Q )
NABRE	Romans	14	20	For the sake of food , do not destroy the work of God . ( R ) Everything is indeed clean , but it is wrong for anyone to become a stumbling block by eating ;
NABRE	Romans	14	21	it is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble .
NABRE	Romans	14	22	Keep the faith [ that ] you have to yourself in the presence of God ; blessed is the one who does not condemn himself for what he approves .
NABRE	Romans	14	23	( S ) But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats , because this is not from faith ; for whatever is not from faith is sin . [ e ] Footnotes - 14:1–15:6 Since Christ spells termination of the law , which included observance of specific days and festivals as well as dietary instruction , the jettisoning of long-practiced customs was traumatic for many Christians brought up under the Mosaic code . Although Paul acknowledges that in principle no food is a source of moral contamination ( Rom 14:14 ) , he recommends that the consciences of Christians who are scrupulous in this regard be respected by other Christians ( Rom 14:21 ) . On the other hand , those who have scruples are not to sit in judgment on those who know that the gospel has liberated them from such ordinances ( Rom 14:10 ) . See

NABRE	Romans	15	7	Welcome one another , then , as Christ welcomed you , for the glory of God . ( F )
NABRE	Romans	15	8	For I say that Christ became a minister of the circumcised to show God ’ s truthfulness , to confirm the promises to the patriarchs , ( G )

NABRE	Romans	15	14	[ e ] I myself am convinced about you , my brothers , that you yourselves are full of goodness , [ f ] filled with all knowledge , and able to admonish one another .
NABRE	Romans	15	16	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in performing the priestly service of the gospel of God , so that the offering up of the Gentiles may be acceptable , sanctified by the holy Spirit . ( N )
NABRE	Romans	15	17	In Christ Jesus , then , I have reason to boast in what pertains to God .
NABRE	Romans	15	18	For I will not dare to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to lead the Gentiles to obedience by word and deed , ( O )
NABRE	Romans	15	19	by the power of signs and wonders , by the power of the Spirit [ of God ] , so that from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum [ g ] I have finished preaching the gospel of Christ .
NABRE	Romans	15	20	Thus I aspire [ h ] to proclaim the gospel not where Christ has already been named , so that I do not build on another ’ s foundation , ( P )
NABRE	Romans	15	21	but as it is written : ( Q ) “ Those who have never been told of him shall see , and those who have never heard of him shall understand. ” [ i ] Paul ’ s Plans ; Need for Prayers .
NABRE	Romans	15	22	That is why I have so often been prevented from coming to you .
NABRE	Romans	15	23	But now , since I no longer have any opportunity in these regions and since I have desired to come to you for many years , ( R )
NABRE	Romans	15	24	I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain and to be sent on my way there by you , after I have enjoyed being with you for a time . ( S )
NABRE	Romans	15	25	[ j ] Now , however , I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the holy ones . ( T )
NABRE	Romans	15	26	For Macedonia and Achaia [ k ] have decided to make some contribution for the poor among the holy ones in Jerusalem ; ( U )
NABRE	Romans	15	27	they decided to do it , and in fact they are indebted to them , for if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings , they ought also to serve them in material blessings . ( V )
NABRE	Romans	15	28	So when I have completed this and safely handed over this contribution to them , I shall set out by way of you to Spain ;
NABRE	Romans	15	29	and I know that in coming to you I shall come in the fullness of Christ ’ s blessing .
NABRE	Romans	15	30	I urge you , [ brothers , ] by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit , to join me in the struggle by your prayers to God on my behalf , ( W )
NABRE	Romans	15	31	that I may be delivered from the disobedient in Judea , and that my ministry for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the holy ones ,
NABRE	Romans	15	32	so that I may come to you with joy by the will of God and be refreshed together with you .
NABRE	Romans	15	33	The God of peace be with all of you . Amen . ( X ) Footnotes - 15:3 Liberation from the law of Moses does not make the scriptures of the old covenant irrelevant . Much consolation and motivation for Christian living can be derived from the Old Testament , as in the citation from Ps 69:10 . Because this psalm is quoted several times in the New Testament , it has been called indirectly messianic . - 15:5 Think in harmony : a Greco-Roman ideal . Not rigid uniformity of thought and expression but thoughtful consideration of other people ’ s views finds expression here . - 15:7–13 True oneness of mind is found in pondering the ultimate mission of the church : to bring it about that God ’ s name be glorified throughout the world and that Jesus Christ be universally recognized as God ’ s gift to all humanity . Paul here prepares his addressees for the climactic appeal he is about to make . - 15:10 Paul ’ s citation of Dt 32:43 follows the Greek version . - 15:14–33 Paul sees himself as apostle and benefactor in the priestly service of the gospel and so sketches plans for a mission in Spain , supported by those in Rome . - 15:14 Full of goodness : the opposite of what humanity was filled with according to Rom 1:29–30 . - 15:19 Illyricum : Roman province northwest of Greece on the eastern shore of the Adriatic . - 15:20 I aspire : Paul uses terminology customarily applied to philanthropists . Unlike some philanthropists of his time , Paul does not engage in cheap competition for public acclaim . This explanation of his missionary policy is to assure the Christians in Rome that he is also not planning to remain in that city and build on other people ’ s foundations ( cf .

Compare his advice to the Philippians to work out their salvation with “ fear and trembling ” ( Phil 2:12 ) , because God is at work in them just as his exalting power was paradoxically at work in the emptying , humiliation , and obedience of Jesus to death on the cross ( Phil 2:6–11 ) . - 2:4 Among many manuscript readings here the best is either “ not with the persuasion of wisdom ” or “ not with persuasive words of wisdom , ” which differ only by a nuance . Whichever reading is accepted , the inefficacy of human wisdom for salvation is contrasted with the power of the cross . - 2:6–3:4 Paul now asserts paradoxically what he has previously been denying .

NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	7	Indeed , I wish everyone to be as I am , but each has a particular gift from God , [ e ] one of one kind and one of another . ( A )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	2	but because of cases of immorality every man should have his own wife , and every woman her own husband .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	3	The husband should fulfill his duty toward his wife , and likewise the wife toward her husband .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	4	A wife does not have authority over her own body , but rather her husband , and similarly a husband does not have authority over his own body , but rather his wife .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Do not deprive each other , except perhaps by mutual consent for a time , to be free for prayer , but then return to one another , so that Satan may not tempt you through your lack of self-control .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	6	This I say by way of concession , [ d ] however , not as a command .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	8	[ f ] ( B ) Now to the unmarried and to widows I say : it is a good thing for them to remain as they are , as I do ,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	9	but if they can not exercise self-control they should marry , for it is better to marry than to be on fire .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	10	( C ) To the married , however , I give this instruction ( not I , but the Lord ) : [ g ] A wife should not separate from her husband
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	11	—and if she does separate she must either remain single or become reconciled to her husband—and a husband should not divorce his wife .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	12	To the rest [ h ] I say ( not the Lord ) : if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever , and she is willing to go on living with him , he should not divorce her ;
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	13	and if any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever , and he is willing to go on living with her , she should not divorce her husband .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is made holy through his wife , and the unbelieving wife is made holy through the brother . Otherwise your children would be unclean , whereas in fact they are holy . ( D )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	15	If the unbeliever separates , [ i ] however , let him separate . The brother or sister is not bound in such cases ; God has called you to peace .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	16	For how do you know , wife , whether you will save your husband ; or how do you know , husband , whether you will save your wife ? The Life That the Lord Has Assigned . [ j ]
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	17	Only , everyone should live as the Lord has assigned , just as God called each one . I give this order in all the churches .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Was someone called after he had been circumcised ? He should not try to undo his circumcision . Was an uncircumcised person called ? He should not be circumcised . ( E )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision means nothing , and uncircumcision means nothing ; what matters is keeping God ’ s commandments . ( F )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Everyone should remain in the state in which he was called .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Were you a slave when you were called ? Do not be concerned but , even if you can gain your freedom , make the most of it .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For the slave called in the Lord is a freed person in the Lord , just as the free person who has been called is a slave of Christ . ( G )

NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	25	Now in regard to virgins I have no commandment from the Lord , [ k ] but I give my opinion as one who by the Lord ’ s mercy is trustworthy .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	26	So this is what I think best because of the present distress : that it is a good thing for a person to remain as he is . ( I )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Are you bound to a wife ? Do not seek a separation . Are you free of a wife ? Then do not look for a wife .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	28	If you marry , however , you do not sin , nor does an unmarried woman sin if she marries ; but such people will experience affliction in their earthly life , and I would like to spare you that .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	29	[ l ] I tell you , brothers , the time is running out . From now on , let those having wives act as not having them , ( J )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	30	those weeping as not weeping , those rejoicing as not rejoicing , those buying as not owning ,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	31	those using the world as not using it fully . For the world in its present form is passing away .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	32	I should like you to be free of anxieties . An unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord , how he may please the Lord .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But a married man is anxious about the things of the world , how he may please his wife , ( K )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	34	and he is divided . An unmarried woman or a virgin is anxious about the things of the Lord , so that she may be holy in both body and spirit . A married woman , on the other hand , is anxious about the things of the world , how she may please her husband . ( L )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	35	I am telling you this for your own benefit , not to impose a restraint upon you , but for the sake of propriety and adherence to the Lord without distraction . ( M )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	36	[ m ] If anyone thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin , and if a critical moment has come [ n ] and so it has to be , let him do as he wishes . He is committing no sin ; let them get married .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	37	The one who stands firm in his resolve , however , who is not under compulsion but has power over his own will , and has made up his mind to keep his virgin , will be doing well .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So then , the one who marries his virgin does well ; the one who does not marry her will do better .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	7	39	[ o ] A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives . But if her husband dies , she is free to be married to whomever she wishes , provided that it be in the Lord . ( N )

NABRE	1%20Corinthians	8	2	Cor 6:3 ; Rom 14:13 , 20–1 ) . This is a basic moral imperative for Paul , a counterpart to the positive imperative to “ build one another up ” ; compare the expression “ giving offense ” as opposed to “ pleasing ” in

NABRE	1%20Corinthians	8	7	But not all have this knowledge . There are some who have been so used to idolatry up until now that , when they eat meat sacrificed to idols , their conscience , which is weak , is defiled . ( E )

NABRE	1%20Corinthians	8	10	If someone sees you , with your knowledge , reclining at table in the temple of an idol , may not his conscience too , weak as it is , be “ built up ” to eat the meat sacrificed to idols ?
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	8	11	Thus through your knowledge , the weak person is brought to destruction , the brother for whom Christ died . ( H )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	8	12	When you sin in this way against your brothers and wound their consciences , weak as they are , you are sinning against Christ .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	8	13	[ e ] ( I ) Therefore , if food causes my brother to sin , I will never eat meat again , so that I may not cause my brother to sin . Footnotes - 8:1–11:1 The Corinthians ’ second question concerns meat that has been sacrificed to idols ; in this area they were exhibiting a disordered sense of liberation that Paul here tries to rectify . These chapters contain a sustained and unified argument that illustrates Paul ’ s method of theological reflection on a moral dilemma . Although the problem with which he is dealing is dated , the guidelines for moral decisions that he offers are of lasting validity . Essentially Paul urges them to take a communitarian rather than an individualistic view of their Christian freedom . Many decisions that they consider pertinent only to their private relationship with God have , in fact , social consequences . Nor can moral decisions be determined by merely theoretical considerations ; they must be based on concrete circumstances , specifically on the value and needs of other individuals and on mutual responsibility within the community . Paul here introduces the theme of “ building up ” ( oikodomē ) , i.e. , of contributing by individual action to the welfare and growth of the community . This theme will be further developed in

NABRE	1%20Corinthians	11	18	First of all , I hear that when you meet as a church there are divisions among you , and to a degree I believe it ; ( I )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	11	19	there have to be factions among you in order that [ also ] those who are approved among you may become known . [ j ]
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	11	20	When you meet in one place , then , it is not to eat the Lord ’ s supper ,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	11	21	for in eating , each one goes ahead with his own supper , and one goes hungry while another gets drunk .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	11	22	Do you not have houses in which you can eat and drink ? Or do you show contempt for the church of God and make those who have nothing feel ashamed ? What can I say to you ? Shall I praise you ? In this matter I do not praise you . ( J ) Tradition of the Institution .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	11	23	[ k ] For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you , ( K ) that the Lord Jesus , on the night he was handed over , took bread ,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	11	24	and , after he had given thanks , broke it and said , “ This is my body that is for you . Do this in remembrance of me. ”
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	11	25	In the same way also the cup , after supper , saying , “ This cup is the new covenant in my blood . Do this , as often as you drink it , in remembrance of me. ” ( L )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup , you proclaim the death of the Lord until he comes .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	11	27	Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will have to answer for the body and blood of the Lord . [ l ]
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	11	28	A person should examine himself , [ m ] and so eat the bread and drink the cup .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	11	29	For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body , eats and drinks judgment [ n ] on himself .

NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	12	As a body is one though it has many parts , and all the parts of the body , though many , are one body , so also Christ . ( G )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	2	Cor 2:14–6:13 ; 10:1–13:30 , esp .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	3	Therefore , I tell you that nobody speaking by the spirit of God says , “ Jesus be accursed. ” And no one can say , “ Jesus is Lord , ” except by the holy Spirit . ( B )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	4	[ c ] There are different kinds of spiritual gifts but the same Spirit ; ( C )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	5	there are different forms of service but the same Lord ;
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	6	there are different workings but the same God who produces all of them in everyone .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	7	To each individual the manifestation of the Spirit is given for some benefit .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	8	To one is given through the Spirit the expression of wisdom ; to another the expression of knowledge according to the same Spirit ; ( D )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	9	to another faith by the same Spirit ; to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit ;
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	10	to another mighty deeds ; to another prophecy ; to another discernment of spirits ; to another varieties of tongues ; to another interpretation of tongues . ( E )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	11	But one and the same Spirit produces all of these , distributing them individually to each person as he wishes . ( F ) One Body , Many Parts . [ d ]
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body , whether Jews or Greeks , slaves or free persons , and we were all given to drink of one Spirit . ( H )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	14	Now the body is not a single part , but many .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	15	If a foot should say , “ Because I am not a hand I do not belong to the body , ” it does not for this reason belong any less to the body .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	16	Or if an ear should say , “ Because I am not an eye I do not belong to the body , ” it does not for this reason belong any less to the body .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , where would the hearing be ? If the whole body were hearing , where would the sense of smell be ?
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But as it is , God placed the parts , each one of them , in the body as he intended .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	19	If they were all one part , where would the body be ?
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	20	But as it is , there are many parts , yet one body .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	21	The eye can not say to the hand , “ I do not need you , ” nor again the head to the feet , “ I do not need you. ”
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	22	Indeed , the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are all the more necessary ,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	23	and those parts of the body that we consider less honorable we surround with greater honor , and our less presentable parts are treated with greater propriety ,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	24	whereas our more presentable parts do not need this . But God has so constructed the body as to give greater honor to a part that is without it ,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	25	so that there may be no division in the body , but that the parts may have the same concern for one another .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	12	26	If [ one ] part suffers , all the parts suffer with it ; if one part is honored , all the parts share its joy . Application to Christ . [ e ]

Footnotes - 12:1–14:40 Ecstatic and charismatic activity were common in early Christian experience , as they were in other ancient religions . But the Corinthians seem to have developed a disproportionate esteem for certain phenomena , especially tongues , to the detriment of order in the liturgy . Paul ’ s response to this development provides us with the fullest exposition we have of his theology of the charisms . - 12:2–3 There is an experience of the Spirit and an understanding of ecstatic phenomena that are specifically Christian and that differ , despite apparent similarities , from those of the pagans . It is necessary to discern which spirit is leading one ; ecstatic phenomena must be judged by their effect (

NABRE	1%20Corinthians	13	13	within the discussion of spiritual gifts is to relativize all the charisms by contrasting them with the more basic , pervasive , and enduring value that gives them their purpose and their effectiveness . The rhetoric of this chapter is striking . - 13:1–3 An inventory of gifts , arranged in careful gradation : neither tongues ( on the lowest rung ) , nor prophecy , knowledge , or faith , nor even self-sacrifice has value unless informed by love . - 13:4–7 This paragraph is developed by personification and enumeration , defining love by what it does or does not do . The Greek contains fifteen verbs ; it is natural to translate many of them by adjectives in English . - 13:8–13 The final paragraph announces its topic , Love never fails (
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	13	2	And if I have the gift of prophecy and comprehend all mysteries and all knowledge ; if I have all faith so as to move mountains but do not have love , I am nothing . ( B )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	13	3	If I give away everything I own , and if I hand my body over so that I may boast but do not have love , I gain nothing . ( C )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	13	4	[ c ] Love is patient , love is kind . It is not jealous , [ love ] is not pompous , it is not inflated , ( D )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	13	5	it is not rude , it does not seek its own interests , it is not quick-tempered , it does not brood over injury , ( E )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	13	6	it does not rejoice over wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	13	7	It bears all things , believes all things , hopes all things , endures all things . ( F )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	13	8	[ d ] Love never fails . If there are prophecies , they will be brought to nothing ; if tongues , they will cease ; if knowledge , it will be brought to nothing .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	13	9	For we know partially and we prophesy partially ,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	13	10	but when the perfect comes , the partial will pass away .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	13	11	When I was a child , I used to talk as a child , think as a child , reason as a child ; when I became a man , I put aside childish things .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	13	12	At present we see indistinctly , as in a mirror , but then face to face . At present I know partially ; then I shall know fully , as I am fully known . ( G )

NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	1	Cor 11:5 ,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	14	[ For ] if I pray in a tongue , my spirit [ f ] is at prayer but my mind is unproductive .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	2	[ b ] For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to human beings but to God , for no one listens ; he utters mysteries in spirit .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	3	On the other hand , one who prophesies does speak to human beings , for their building up , [ c ] encouragement , and solace . ( B )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	4	,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	5	,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	6	[ d ] Now , brothers , if I should come to you speaking in tongues , what good will I do you if I do not speak to you by way of revelation , or knowledge , or prophecy , or instruction ?
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	7	Likewise , if inanimate things that produce sound , such as flute or harp , do not give out the tones distinctly , how will what is being played on flute or harp be recognized ?
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	8	And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound , who will get ready for battle ?
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	9	Similarly , if you , because of speaking in tongues , do not utter intelligible speech , how will anyone know what is being said ? For you will be talking to the air .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	10	It happens that there are many different languages in the world , and none is meaningless ;
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	11	which appears to take it for granted that women do pray and prophesy aloud in the assembly ( cf .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	12	. - 14:13–19 The charism of interpretation lifts tongues to the level of intelligibility , enabling them to produce the same effect as prophecy ( cf .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	13	) . Hence the verses are often considered an interpolation , reflecting the discipline of later churches ; such an interpolation would have to have antedated our manuscripts , all of which contain them , though some transpose them to the very end of the chapter . Scripture texts , prefaces , introductions , footnotes and cross references used in this work are taken from the New American Bible , revised edition ©
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	15	So what is to be done ? I will pray with the spirit , but I will also pray with the mind . I will sing praise with the spirit , but I will also sing praise with the mind . ( C )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	16	Otherwise , if you pronounce a blessing [ with ] the spirit , how shall one who holds the place of the uninstructed say the “ Amen ” to your thanksgiving , since he does not know what you are saying ?
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	17	) . It has been anticipated at
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I give thanks to God that I speak in tongues more than any of you ,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	19	,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	20	[ g ] Brothers , stop being childish in your thinking . In respect to evil be like infants , but in your thinking be mature . ( D )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	21	It is written in the law : “ By people speaking strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people , and even so they will not listen to me , ( E ) says the Lord. ”
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	22	Thus , tongues are a sign not for those who believe but for unbelievers , whereas prophecy is not for unbelievers but for those who believe .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	23	[ h ] So if the whole church meets in one place and everyone speaks in tongues , and then uninstructed people or unbelievers should come in , will they not say that you are out of your minds ? ( F )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if everyone is prophesying , and an unbeliever or uninstructed person should come in , he will be convinced by everyone and judged by everyone ,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	25	and the secrets of his heart will be disclosed , and so he will fall down and worship God , declaring , “ God is really in your midst. ” ( G ) Rules of Order .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	26	enunciates the basic criterion in the use of any gift : it must contribute to “ building up. ” - 14:33b–36 Verse 33b may belong with what precedes , so that the new paragraph would begin only with
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	27	If anyone speaks in a tongue , let it be two or at most three , and each in turn , and one should interpret .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	28	But if there is no interpreter , the person should keep silent in the church and speak to himself and to God .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	29	Two or three prophets should speak , and the others discern .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	30	But if a revelation is given to another person sitting there , the first one should be silent .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	31	) and the scene describing the ideal exercise of prophecy (
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	32	Indeed , the spirits of prophets are under the prophets ’ control ,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	33	since he is not the God of disorder but of peace . As in all the churches of the holy ones , [ j ]
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	34	women should keep silent in the churches , for they are not allowed to speak , but should be subordinate , as even the law says . ( I )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	35	But if they want to learn anything , they should ask their husbands at home . For it is improper for a woman to speak in the church .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	36	Did the word of God go forth from you ? Or has it come to you alone ?
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	37	If anyone thinks that he is a prophet or a spiritual person , he should recognize that what I am writing to you is a commandment of the Lord .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	38	If anyone does not acknowledge this , he is not acknowledged .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	39	So , [ my ] brothers , strive eagerly to prophesy , and do not forbid speaking in tongues ,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	14	40	but everything must be done properly and in order . Footnotes - 14:1–5

NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	1	Cor 2:1 , 7–10a . The final trumpet and the awakening of the dead are stock details of the apocalyptic scenario . We shall not all fall asleep : Paul expected that some of his contemporaries might still be alive at Christ ’ s return ; after the death of Paul and his whole generation , copyists altered this statement in various ways . We will all be changed : the statement extends to all Christians , for Paul is not directly speaking about anyone else . Whether they have died before the end or happen still to be alive , all must be transformed . - 15:54–55 Death is swallowed up in victory : scripture itself predicts death ’ s overthrow . O death : in his prophetic vision Paul may be making Hosea ’ s words his own , or imagining this cry of triumph on the lips of the risen church . - 15:56 The sting of death is sin : an explanation of Hosea ’ s metaphor . Death , scorpion-like , is equipped with a sting , sin , by which it injects its poison . Christ defeats sin , the cause of death ( Gn 3:19 ; Rom 5:12 ) .

NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	15	Then we are also false witnesses to God , because we testified against God that he raised Christ , whom he did not raise if in fact the dead are not raised . ( G )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	2	Corinthians , would be pointless without the prospect of resurrection ; a life of pleasure , such as that expressed in the Epicurean slogan of
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	3	[ c ] For I handed on to you as of first importance what I also received : that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures ; ( A )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	4	that he was buried ; that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures ; ( B )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	5	that he appeared to Cephas , then to the Twelve . ( C )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	6	After that , he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once , most of whom are still living , though some have fallen asleep .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	7	After that he appeared to James , then to all the apostles .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	8	Last of all , as to one born abnormally , he appeared to me . ( D )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least [ d ] of the apostles , not fit to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God . ( E )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God I am what I am , and his grace to me has not been ineffective . Indeed , I have toiled harder than all of them ; not I , however , but the grace of God [ that is ] with me .

NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	12	But if Christ is preached as raised from the dead , how can some among you say there is no resurrection of the dead ?
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	13	If there is no resurrection of the dead , then neither has Christ been raised . ( F )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ has not been raised , then empty [ too ] is our preaching ; empty , too , your faith .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	16	) , is that if there is no such thing as ( bodily ) resurrection , then it has not taken place even in Christ ’ s case . - 15:17–18 The consequences for the Corinthians are grave : both forgiveness of sins and salvation are an illusion , despite their strong convictions about both . Unless Christ is risen , their faith does not save . - 15:20–28 After a triumphant assertion of the reality of Christ ’ s resurrection (
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	17	and if Christ has not been raised , [ f ] your faith is vain ; you are still in your sins .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	18	Then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If for this life only we have hoped in Christ , we are the most pitiable people of all . Christ the Firstfruits . [ g ]
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	20	( H ) But now Christ has been raised from the dead , the firstfruits [ h ] of those who have fallen asleep .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	21	[ i ] For since death came through a human being , the resurrection of the dead came also through a human being .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For just as in Adam all die , so too in Christ shall all be brought to life , ( I )

NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	26	[ k ] The last enemy ( M ) to be destroyed is death ,
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	27	[ l ] for “ he subjected everything under his feet. ” ( N ) But when it says that everything has been subjected , it is clear that it excludes the one who subjected everything to him .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	28	) . That God may be all in all : his reign is a dynamic exercise of creative power , an outpouring of life and energy through the universe , with no further resistance . This is the supremely positive meaning of “ subjection ” : that God may fully be God . - 15:29–34 Paul concludes his treatment of logical inconsistencies with a listing of miscellaneous Christian practices that would be meaningless if the resurrection were not a fact . - 15:29 Baptized for the dead : this practice is not further explained here , nor is it necessarily mentioned with approval , but Paul cites it as something in their experience that attests in one more way to belief in the resurrection . - 15:30–34 A life of sacrifice , such as Paul describes in
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Otherwise , what will people accomplish by having themselves baptized for the dead ? [ n ] If the dead are not raised at all , then why are they having themselves baptized for them ?
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	30	[ o ] Moreover , why are we endangering ourselves all the time ? ( P )

NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	32	, 44–46 . Application of some Old Testament texts ( Ps 2:7 ; 16:8–11 ) to his resurrection is illustrated by Acts 2:27–31 ; 13:29–39 ; and Is 52:13–53:12 and Hos 6:2 may also have been envisaged . - 15:9–11 A persecutor may have appeared disqualified ( ouk…hikanos ) from apostleship , but in fact God ’ s grace has qualified him . Cf . the remarks in
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Do not be led astray : “ Bad company corrupts good morals. ”
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Become sober as you ought and stop sinning . For some have no knowledge of God ; I say this to your shame . ( S ) C. The Manner of the Resurrection [ p ]
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	35	[ q ] But someone may say , “ How are the dead raised ? With what kind of body will they come back ? ” The Resurrection Body .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	36	[ r ] You fool ! What you sow is not brought to life unless it dies . ( T )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	37	And what you sow is not the body that is to be but a bare kernel of wheat , perhaps , or of some other kind ;
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	38	( U ) but God gives it a body as he chooses , and to each of the seeds its own body .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	39	[ s ] Not all flesh is the same , but there is one kind for human beings , another kind of flesh for animals , another kind of flesh for birds , and another for fish .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	40	There are both heavenly bodies and earthly bodies , but the brightness of the heavenly is one kind and that of the earthly another .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	41	The brightness of the sun is one kind , the brightness of the moon another , and the brightness of the stars another . For star differs from star in brightness .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	42	[ t ] So also is the resurrection of the dead . It is sown corruptible ; it is raised incorruptible .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	43	It is sown dishonorable ; it is raised glorious . It is sown weak ; it is raised powerful . ( V )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body . If there is a natural body , there is also a spiritual one .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	45	So , too , it is written , “ The first man , Adam , [ u ] became a living being , ” the last Adam a life-giving spirit . ( W )
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	46	But the spiritual was not first ; rather the natural and then the spiritual .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man was from the earth , earthly ; the second man , from heaven .
NABRE	1%20Corinthians	15	48	As was the earthly one , so also are the earthly , and as is the heavenly one , so also are the heavenly .

Seven is the number usually mentioned , but the Testament of Levi ( 2:7–10 ; 3:1–4 ) speaks of three ; God himself dwelt in the third of these . Without giving us any clear picture of the cosmos , Paul indicates a mental journey to a nonearthly space , set apart by God , in which secrets were revealed to him . Ineffable things : i.e. , privileged knowledge , which it was not possible or permitted to divulge . - 12:5–7 This person : the indirect way of referring to himself has the effect of emphasizing the distance between that experience and his everyday life , just as the indirect someone in Christ (

Acts 9:23–31 and the note on Acts 12:25 ) . He is quite explicit about contacts there , testifying under oath ( Gal 1:20 ) . On returning to Syria ( perhaps specifically Damascus , cf . Gal 1:17 ) and Cilicia ( including his home town Tarsus , cf . Acts 9:30 ; 22:3 ) , Paul most likely engaged in missionary work . He underscores the fact that Christians in Judea knew of him only by reputation . - 1:18 After three years : two years and more , since Paul ’ s call . To confer with Cephas may mean simply “ pay a visit ” or more specifically “ get information from ” him about Jesus , over a two-week period . Cephas : Aramaic name of Simon ( Peter ) ; cf .

The specific facts that he takes up here to show that his gospel is not a human invention ( Gal 1:11 ) but came through a revelation of Jesus Christ ( Gal 1:12 ) deal with his own calling as a Christian missionary ( Gal 1:13–17 ) , his initial relations with the apostles in Jerusalem ( Gal 1:18–24 ) , a later journey to Jerusalem ( Gal 2:1–10 ) , and an incident in Antioch involving Cephas and persons from James ( Gal 2:11–14 ) . The content of Paul ’ s revealed gospel is then set forth in the heart of the letter ( Gal 2:15–21 ) . - 1:12 Although Paul received his gospel through a revelation from Christ , this did not exclude his use of early Christian confessional formulations . See note on Gal 1:4 . - 1:13–17 Along with Phil 3:4–11 , which also moves from autobiography to its climax in a discussion on justification by faith ( cf . Gal 2:15–21 ) , this passage is Paul ’ s chief account of the change from his former way of life ( Gal 1:13 ) to service as a Christian missionary ( Gal 1:16 ) ; cf . Acts 9:1–22 ; 22:4–16 ; 26:9–18 . Paul himself does not use the term “ conversion ” but stresses revelation ( Gal 1:12 ,

NABRE	Galatians	1	11	( H ) Now I want you to know , brothers , that the gospel preached by me is not of human origin .
NABRE	Galatians	1	12	For I did not receive it from a human being , nor was I taught it , but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ . [ j ]
NABRE	Galatians	1	13	[ k ] For you heard of my former way of life in Judaism , how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it , ( I )

NABRE	Galatians	2	2	Cor 8–9 ) . - 2:11–14 The decision reached in Jerusalem ( Gal 2:3–7 ) recognized the freedom of Gentile Christians from the Jewish law . But the problem of table fellowship between Jewish Christians , who possibly still kept kosher food regulations , and Gentile believers was not yet settled . When Cephas first came to the racially mixed community of Jewish and Gentile Christians in Antioch ( Gal 2:12 ) , he ate with non-Jews . Pressure from persons arriving later from Jerusalem caused him and Barnabas to draw back . Paul therefore publicly rebuked Peter ’ s inconsistency toward the gospel ( Gal 2:14 ) . Some think that what Paul said on that occasion extends through Gal 2:16 ,

NABRE	Galatians	2	3	Moreover , not even [ d ] Titus , who was with me , although he was a Greek , was compelled to be circumcised , ( C )
NABRE	Galatians	2	4	but because of the false brothers [ e ] secretly brought in , who slipped in to spy on our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus , ( D ) that they might enslave us—

The circumcised : presumably Jewish Christians , not Jews . - 2:13 The Jews : Jewish Christians , like Barnabas . Hypocrisy : literally , “ pretense , ” “ play-acting ” ; moral insincerity . - 2:14 Compel the Gentiles to live like Jews : that is , conform to Jewish practices , such as circumcision ( Gal 2:3–5 ) or regulations about food ( Gal 2:12 ) . - 2:15–21 Following on the series of incidents cited above , Paul ’ s argument , whether spoken to Cephas at Antioch or only now articulated , is pertinent to the Galatian situation , where believers were having themselves circumcised ( Gal 6:12–13 ) and obeying other aspects of Jewish law ( Gal 4:9–10 ; 5:1–4 ) . He insists that salvation is by faith in Christ , not by works of the law . His teaching on the gospel concerns justification by faith ( Gal 2:16 ) in relation to sin ( Gal 2:17 ) , law ( Gal 2:19 ) , life in Christ ( Gal 2:19–20 ) , and grace ( Gal 2:21 ) . - 2:16 No one will be justified : Ps 143:2 is reflected . - 2:17 A minister of sin : literally , “ a servant of sin ” ( cf . Rom 15:8 ) , an agent of sin , one who promotes it . This is possibly a claim by opponents that justification on the basis of faith in Christ makes Christ an abettor of sin when Christians are found to be sinners . Paul denies the conclusion ( cf . Rom 6:1–4 ) . - 2:18 To return to observance of the law as the means to salvation would entangle one not only in inevitable transgressions of it but also in the admission that it was wrong to have abandoned the law in the first place . - 2:19 Through the law I died to the law : this is variously explained : the law revealed sin ( Rom 7:7–9 ) and led to death and then to belief in Christ ; or , the law itself brought the insight that law can not justify ( Gal 2:16 ; Ps 143:2 ) ; or , the “ law of Christ ” ( Gal 6:2 ) led to abandoning the Mosaic law ; or , the law put Christ to death ( cf . Gal 3:13 ) and so provided a way to our salvation , through baptism into Christ , through which we die ( crucified with Christ ; see Rom 6:6 ) .

Run , in vain : while Paul presents a positive picture in what follows , his missionary work in Galatia would have been to no purpose if his opponents were correct that circumcision is needed for complete faith in Christ . - 2:3 Not even a Gentile Christian like Titus was compelled to receive the rite of circumcision . The Greek text could be interpreted that he voluntarily accepted circumcision , but this is unlikely in the overall argument . - 2:4 False brothers : Jewish Christians who took the position that Gentile Christians must first become Jews through circumcision and observance of the Mosaic law in order to become Christians ; cf . Acts 15:1 . - 2:5 The truth of the gospel : the true gospel , in contrast to the false one of the opponents ( Gal 1:6–9 ) ; the gospel of grace , used as a norm ( Gal 2:14 ) . - 2:7–9 Some think that actual “ minutes ” of the meeting are here quoted . Paul ’ s apostleship to the Gentiles ( Gal 1:16 ) is recognized alongside that of Peter to the Jews . Moreover , the right to proclaim the gospel without requiring circumcision and the Jewish law is sealed by a handshake . That Paul and colleagues should go to the Gentiles did not exclude his preaching to the Jews as well ( Rom 1:13–16 ) or Cephas to Gentile areas . - 2:9 James and Cephas and John : see notes on Gal 1:18 ,

Usually , Gal 1:1–10 is equated with the “ Council of Jerusalem , ” as it is called , described in Acts
NABRE	Galatians	2	12	. Paul emphasizes it was God ’ s will , not Jerusalem authority , that led to the journey . Acts 15:2 states that the church in Antioch appointed Paul and Barnabas for the task .

NABRE	Galatians	3	3	Are you so stupid ? ( C ) After beginning with the Spirit , are you now ending with the flesh ? [ d ]
NABRE	Galatians	3	1	O stupid [ b ] Galatians ! Who has bewitched you , before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified ? ( A )
NABRE	Galatians	3	2	I want to learn only this from you : ( B ) did you receive the Spirit from works of the law , or from faith in what you heard ? [ c ]
NABRE	Galatians	3	4	Did you experience so many things [ e ] in vain ? —if indeed it was in vain .
NABRE	Galatians	3	5	Does , then , the one who supplies the Spirit to you and works mighty deeds among you do so from works of the law or from faith in what you heard ? ( D )
NABRE	Galatians	3	6	Thus Abraham “ believed God , ( E ) and it was credited to him as righteousness. ” [ f ]
NABRE	Galatians	3	7	; 13:15 ; 17:7–8 ; 22:16–18 ; 24:7 ) is not superseded by the law , which came much later , in the time of Moses . The inheritance ( of the Spirit and the blessings ) is by promise , not by law ( Gal 3:18 ) . Paul ’ s argument hinges on the fact that the same Greek word , diathēkē , can be rendered as will or testament ( Gal 3:15 ) and as covenant ( Gal 3:17 ) . - 3:16 Descendant : literally , “ and to his seed. ” The Hebrew , as in Gn 12:7 ; 15:18 ; 22:17–18 , is a collective singular , traditionally rendered as a plural , descendants , but taken by Paul in its literal number to refer to Christ as descendant of Abraham . - 3:17 Four hundred and thirty years afterward : follows Ex 12:40 in the Greek ( Septuagint ) version , in contrast to Gn 15:13 and Acts 7:6 , for chronology . - 3:18 This refutes the opponents ’ contention that the promises of God are fulfilled only as a reward for human observance of the law . - 3:19–22 A digression : if the Mosaic law , then , does not save or bring life , why was it given ? Elsewhere , Paul says the law served to show what sin is ( Rom 3:20 ; 7:7–8 ) . Here the further implication is that the law in effect served to produce transgressions . Moreover , it was received at second hand by angels , through a mediator , not directly from God ( Gal 3:19 ) . The law does not , however , oppose God ’ s purposes , for it carries out its function ( Gal 3:22 ) , so that righteousness comes by faith and promise , not by human works of the law . - 3:19 The descendant : Christ ( Gal 3:16 ) . By angels : Dt 33:2–4 stressed their presence as enhancing the importance of the law ; Paul uses their role to diminish its significance ( cf . Acts 7:38 ,
NABRE	Galatians	3	8	Scripture , which saw in advance that God would justify the Gentiles by faith , foretold the good news to Abraham , saying , “ Through you shall all the nations be blessed. ” ( G )
NABRE	Galatians	3	9	Consequently , those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham who had faith . ( H )
NABRE	Galatians	3	10	[ h ] For all who depend on works of the law are under a curse ; for it is written , “ Cursed be everyone who does not persevere in doing all the things written in the book of the law. ” ( I )
NABRE	Galatians	3	11	And that no one is justified before God by the law is clear , for “ the one who is righteous by faith will live. ” ( J )
NABRE	Galatians	3	12	But the law does not depend on faith ; rather , “ the one who does these things will live by them. ” ( K )
NABRE	Galatians	3	13	Christ ransomed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us , for it is written , “ Cursed be everyone who hangs on a tree , ” ( L )
NABRE	Galatians	3	14	, 16–18 ,
NABRE	Galatians	3	15	[ i ] Brothers , in human terms I say that no one can annul or amend even a human will once ratified . ( N )
NABRE	Galatians	3	16	Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his descendant . [ j ] It does not say , “ And to descendants , ” as referring to many , but as referring to one , “ And to your descendant , ” who is Christ . ( O )
NABRE	Galatians	3	17	This is what I mean : the law , which came four hundred and thirty years afterward , [ k ] does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God , so as to cancel the promise . ( P )
NABRE	Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance comes from the law , ( Q ) it is no longer from a promise ; but God bestowed it on Abraham through a promise . [ l ]
NABRE	Galatians	3	19	[ m ] Why , then , the law ? It was added for transgressions , until the descendant [ n ] came to whom the promise had been made ; it was promulgated by angels at the hand of a mediator . ( R )
NABRE	Galatians	3	20	Now there is no mediator when only one party is involved , and God is one . ( S )
NABRE	Galatians	3	21	) is supported by appeals to Christian experience ( Gal 3:1–5 ) and to scripture ( Gal 3:6–14 ) . The gift of God ’ s Spirit to the Galatians came from the gospel received in faith , not from doing what the law enjoins . The story of Abraham shows that faith in God brings righteousness ( Gal 3:6 ; Gn 15:6 ) . The promise to Abraham ( Gal 3:8 ; Gn 12:3 ) extends to the Gentiles ( Gal 3:14 ) . - 3:1 Stupid : not just senseless , for they were in danger of deserting their salvation . - 3:2 Faith in what you heard : Paul ’ s message received with faith . The Greek can also mean “ the proclamation of the faith ” or “ a hearing that comes from faith. ” - 3:3 On the contrast of Spirit and flesh , cf . Rom 8:1–11 . Having received the Spirit , they need not be circumcised now . - 3:4 Experience so many things : probably the mighty deeds of Gal 1:5 but possibly the experience of sufferings . - 3:6 Abraham…righteousness : see Gn 15:6 ; Rom 4:3 . The Galatians like Abraham heard with faith and experienced justification . This first argument forms the basis for the further scriptural evidence that follows . - 3:7–9 Faith is what matters , for Abraham and the children of Abraham , in contrast to the claims of the opponents that circumcision and observance of the law are needed to bring the promised blessing of Gn 12:3 ; cf . Gn 18:18 ; Sir 44:21 ; Acts 3:25 . - 3:10–14 Those who depend not on promise and faith but on works of the law are under a curse because they do not persevere in doing all the things written in the book of the law ( Gal 3:10 ; Dt 27:26 ) in order to gain life ( Gal 3:12 ; Lv 18:5 ; cf . Rom 10:5 ) . But scripture teaches that no one is justified before God by the law ( Gal 3:11 ; Hb 2:4 , adapted from the Greek version of Habakkuk ; cf . Rom 1:17 ; Hb 10:38 ) . Salvation , then , depends on faith in Christ who died on the cross ( Gal 3:13 ) , taking upon himself a curse found in Dt 21:23 ( about executed criminals hanged in public view ) , to free us from the curse of the law ( Gal 3:13 ) . That the Gentile Galatians have received the promised Spirit ( Gal 3:14 ) by faith and in no other way returns the argument to the experience cited in Gal 3:1–5 . - 3:15–18 A third argument to support Paul ’ s position that salvation is not through the law but by promise ( Gal 3:1–14 ) comes from legal practice and scriptural history . A legal agreement or human will , duly ratified , is unalterable ( Gal 3:15 ) . God ’ s covenant with Abraham and its repeated promises ( Gn 12:2–3 ,
NABRE	Galatians	3	22	But scripture confined all things under the power of sin , that through faith in Jesus Christ the promise might be given to those who believe . ( U ) What Faith Has Brought Us . [ o ]
NABRE	Galatians	3	23	Before faith came , we were held in custody under law , confined for the faith that was to be revealed . ( V )
NABRE	Galatians	3	24	Consequently , the law was our disciplinarian [ p ] for Christ , that we might be justified by faith . ( W )
NABRE	Galatians	3	25	But now that faith has come , we are no longer under a disciplinarian . ( X )
NABRE	Galatians	3	26	For through faith you are all children of God [ q ] in Christ Jesus . ( Y )

The teaching in Gal 3:23–25 , that since faith ( Christianity ) has come , we are no longer under the law , could be taken with the previous paragraph on the role of the Mosaic law , but it also fits here as a contrast between the situation before faith ( Gal 3:23 ) and the results after faith has come ( Gal 3:25–29 ) . - 3:24–25 Disciplinarian : the Greek paidagōgos referred to a slave who escorted a child to school but did not teach or tutor ; hence , a guardian or monitor . Applying this to the law fits the role of the law described in Gal 3:19–25 . - 3:26 Children of God : literally “ sons , ” in contrast to the young child under the disciplinarian in Gal 3:24–25 . The term includes males and females ( Gal 3:28 ) . - 3:27–28 Likely a formula used at baptism that expresses racial , social-economic , and sexual equality in Christ ( cf .

Acts 16:6 ; 18:23 . - 4:15 That blessedness of yours : possibly a reference to the Galatians ’ initial happy reception of Paul ( Gal 4:14 ) and of his gospel ( Gal 1:6 ; 3:1–4 ) and their felicitation at such blessedness , but the phrase could also refer ironically to earlier praise by Paul of the Galatians , no longer possible when they turn from the gospel to the claims of the opponents ( Gal 4:17–18 ; 1:7 ) . If the word is a more literal reference to a beatitude , Gal 3:26–28 may be in view . - 4:17 Isolate you : that is , from the blessings of the gospel and/or from Paul . - 4:21–31 Paul supports his appeal for the gospel ( Gal 4:9 ; 1:6–9 ; 2:16 ; 3:2 ) by a further argument from scripture ( cf . Gal 3:6–18 ) . It involves the relationship of Abraham ( Gal 3:6–16 ) to his wife , Sarah , the freeborn woman , and to Hagar , the slave woman , and the contrast between the sons born to each , Isaac , child of promise , and Ishmael , son of Hagar ( Gn
NABRE	Galatians	4	3	) . Abba : cf . Mk 14:36 and the note ; Rom 8:15 . - 4:8–11 On the basis of the arguments advanced from Gal 3:1 through Gal 4:7 , Paul now launches his appeal to the Galatians with the question , how can you turn back to the slavery of the law ( Gal 4:9 ) ? The question is posed with reference to bondage to the elemental powers ( see note on Gal 4:3 ) because the Galatians had originally been converted to Christianity from paganism , not Judaism ( Gal 4:8 ) . The use of the direct question is like Gal 3:3–5 . - 4:8 Things that by nature are not gods : or “ gods that by nature do not exist. ” - 4:10 This is likely a reference to ritual observances from the Old Testament , promoted by opponents : sabbaths or Yom Kippur , new moon , Passover or Pentecost , sabbatical years . - 4:11 Cf . Gal 2:2 . If the Galatians become slaves…all over again to the law ( Gal 4:9 ) , Paul will have worked in vain among them . - 4:12–20 A strongly personal section . Paul appeals to past ties between the Galatians and himself . He speaks sharply of the opponents ( Gal 4:17–18 ) and pastorally to the Galatians ( Gal 4:19–20 ) . - 4:12 Because I have also become as you are : a terse phrase in Greek , meaning “ Be as I , Paul , am , ” i.e. , living by faith , independent of the law , for , in spite of my background in Judaism ( Gal 1:13 ) , I have become as you Galatians are now , a brother in Christ . - 4:13 Physical illness : because its nature is not described , some assume an eye disease ( Gal 4:15 ) ; others , epilepsy ; some relate it to

NABRE	Galatians	4	21	) . Only through Isaac is the promise of God preserved . This allegory ( Gal 4:24 ) , with its equation of the Sinai covenant and Mosaic law with slavery and of the promise of God with freedom , Paul uses only in light of previous arguments . His quotation of Gn 21:10 at Gal 4:30 suggests on a scriptural basis that the Galatians should expel those who are troubling them ( Gal 1:7 ) . - 4:25 Hagar represents Sinai… : some manuscripts have what seems a geographical note , “ For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia. ” - 4:27 Is 54:1 in the Septuagint translation is applied to Sarah as the barren one ( in Gn
NABRE	Galatians	4	22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons , one by the slave woman and the other by the freeborn woman . ( L )
NABRE	Galatians	4	23	The son of the slave woman was born naturally , the son of the freeborn through a promise . ( M )
NABRE	Galatians	4	24	Now this is an allegory . These women represent two covenants . One was from Mount Sinai , bearing children for slavery ; this is Hagar . ( N )
NABRE	Galatians	4	25	Hagar represents Sinai , [ o ] a mountain in Arabia ; it corresponds to the present Jerusalem , for she is in slavery along with her children .
NABRE	Galatians	4	26	But the Jerusalem above is freeborn , and she is our mother . ( O )

NABRE	Ephesians	1	2	Cor 1:22 . - 1:15–23 See note on Rom 1:8 for the thanksgiving form in a letter . Much of the content parallels thoughts in Col 1:3–20 . The prayer moves from God and Christ ( Eph 1:17 , 20–21 ) to the Ephesians ( Eph 1:17–19 ) and the church ( Eph 1:22–23 ) . Paul asks that the blessing imparted by God the Father ( Eph 1:3 ) to the Ephesians will be strengthened in them through the message of the gospel ( Eph 1:13 , 17–19 ) . Those blessings are seen in the context of God ’ s might in establishing the sovereignty of Christ over all other creatures ( Eph 1:19–21 ) and in appointing him head of the church ( Eph 1:22–23 ) . For the allusion to angelic spirits in Eph 1:21 , see Rom 8:38 and Col 1:16 . Here , as in

Both Jew and Gentile have experienced , through Christ , God ’ s free gift of salvation that already marks them for a future heavenly destiny ( Eph 2:3–7 ) . The language dead , raised us up , and seated us…in the heavens closely parallels Jesus ’ own passion and Easter experience . The terms in Eph 2:8–9 describe salvation in the way Paul elsewhere speaks of justification : by grace , through faith , the gift of God , not from works ; cf . Gal 2:16–21 ; Rom 3:24–28 . Christians are a newly created people in Christ , fashioned by God for a life of goodness ( Eph 2:10 ) . - 2:1–7 These verses comprise one long sentence in Greek , the main verb coming in Eph 2:5 , God brought us to life , the object you/us dead in…transgressions being repeated in Eph 2:1 ,

NABRE	Ephesians	3	1	Because of this , ( A ) I , Paul , a prisoner of Christ [ b ] [ Jesus ] for you Gentiles—
NABRE	Ephesians	3	2	if , as I suppose , you have heard of the stewardship [ c ] of God ’ s grace that was given to me for your benefit , ( B )
NABRE	Ephesians	3	4	When you read this you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ ,
NABRE	Ephesians	3	5	which was not made known to human beings in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit , ( D )
NABRE	Ephesians	3	6	that the Gentiles are coheirs , members of the same body , and copartners in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel . ( E )
NABRE	Ephesians	3	7	Of this I became a minister by the gift of God ’ s grace that was granted me in accord with the exercise of his power . ( F )
NABRE	Ephesians	3	8	To me , the very least of all the holy ones , this grace was given , to preach to the Gentiles the inscrutable riches of Christ , ( G )
NABRE	Ephesians	3	9	and to bring to light [ for all ] [ e ] what is the plan of the mystery hidden from ages past in God who created all things , ( H )
NABRE	Ephesians	3	10	so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the principalities and authorities [ f ] in the heavens . ( I )
NABRE	Ephesians	3	11	This was according to the eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord ,

NABRE	Ephesians	3	14	For this reason I kneel before the Father ,
NABRE	Ephesians	3	15	from whom every family [ h ] in heaven and on earth is named ,
NABRE	Ephesians	3	16	that he may grant you in accord with the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner self , ( L )

NABRE	Ephesians	3	18	may have strength to comprehend with all the holy ones what is the breadth and length and height and depth , ( N )
NABRE	Ephesians	3	19	and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge , so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God . ( O )
NABRE	Ephesians	3	20	Now to him who is able to accomplish far more than all we ask or imagine , by the power at work within us , ( P )
NABRE	Ephesians	3	21	to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations , forever and ever . Amen . Footnotes - 3:1–13 Paul reflects on his mission to the Gentiles . He alludes to his call and appointment to the apostolic office ( Eph 3:2–3 ) and how his insight through revelation , as well as that of the other apostles and charismatic prophets in the church ( Eph 3:4–5 ) , has deepened understanding of God ’ s plan of salvation in Christ . Paul is the special herald ( Eph 3:7 ) of a new promise to the Gentiles ( Eph 3:6 ) : that the divine plan includes them in the spiritual benefits promised to Israel . Not only is this unique apostolic role his ; Paul also has been given the task of explaining to all the divine plan of salvation ( Eph 3:8–9 ) , once hidden . Through the church , God ’ s plan to save through Christ is becoming manifest to angelic beings ( Eph 3:10 ; cf . Eph 1:21 ) , in accord with God ’ s purpose ( Eph 3:11 ) . The fulfillment of the plan in Christ gives the whole church more confidence through faith in God ( Eph 3:12 ) . The readers of this letter are also thereby encouraged to greater confidence despite Paul ’ s imprisonment ( Eph 3:13 ) . - 3:1 A prisoner of Christ : see Introduction . Paul abruptly departs from his train of thought at the end of Eph 3:1 , leaving an incomplete sentence . - 3:2 Stewardship : the Greek is the same term employed at Eph 1:10 for the plan that God administers ( Col 1:25 ) and in which Paul plays a key role . - 3:3–4 The mystery : God ’ s resolve to deliver Gentiles along with Israel through Christ ; cf . notes on Eph 1:10 ; 3:9 . - 3:9 [ For all ] : while some think this phrase was added so as to yield the sense “ to enlighten all about the plan… , ” it is more likely that some manuscripts and Fathers omitted it accidentally or to avoid the idea that all conflicted with Paul ’ s assignment to preach to the Gentiles ( Eph 3:8 ) specifically . - 3:10 Principalities and authorities : see note on Eph 1:15–23 regarding Eph 3:21 . - 3:14–21 The apostle prays that those he is addressing may , like the rest of the church , deepen their understanding of God ’ s plan of salvation in Christ . It is a plan that affects the whole universe ( Eph 3:15 ) with the breadth and length and height and depth of God ’ s love in Christ ( Eph 3:18 ) or possibly the universe in all its dimensions . The apostle prays that they may perceive the redemptive love of Christ for them and be completely immersed in the fullness of God ( Eph 3:19 ) . The prayer concludes with a doxology to God ( Eph 3:20–21 ) . - 3:14–15 Every family : in the Greek there is wordplay on the word for the Father ( patria , patēr ) . The phrase could also mean “ God ’ s whole family ” ( cf . Eph 2:21 ) .

NABRE	Ephesians	4	12	; cf . Eph 4:16 ) , belonging to a single Lord ( in contrast to the many gods of the pagan world ) , and by one way of salvation through faith , brought out especially by the significance of baptism ( Eph 4:1–6 ; cf . Rom 6:1–11 ) . But Christian unity is more than adherence to a common belief . It is manifested in the exalted Christ ’ s gifts to individuals to serve so as to make the community more Christlike ( Eph 4:11–16 ) . This teaching on Christ as the source of the gifts is introduced in Eph 4:8 by a citation of Ps 68:18 , which depicts Yahweh triumphantly leading Israel to salvation in Jerusalem . It is here understood of Christ , ascending above all the heavens , the head of the church ; through his redemptive death , resurrection , and ascension he has become the source of the church ’ s spiritual gifts . The “ descent ” of Christ ( Eph 4:9–10 ) refers more probably to the incarnation ( cf . Phil 2:6–8 ) than to Christ ’ s presence after his death in the world of the dead ( cf .
NABRE	Ephesians	4	13	until we all attain to the unity of faith and knowledge of the Son of God , to mature manhood , [ f ] to the extent of the full stature of Christ , ( J )

NABRE	Ephesians	5	5	Be sure of this , that no immoral or impure or greedy person , that is , an idolater , has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God . ( E ) Duty to Live in the Light .
NABRE	Ephesians	5	1	Pt 2:18–3:7 for a similar listing of household duties where the inferior is admonished first ( wives , Eph 5:22 ; children , Eph 6:1 ; slaves , Eph 6:5 ) , then the superior ( husbands , Eph 5:25 ; fathers , Eph 6:4 ; masters , Eph 6:9 ) . Paul varies this pattern by an emphasis on mutuality ( see Eph 5:20 ) ; use of Old Testament material about father and mother in Eph 6:2 ; the judgment to come for slave-owners ( you have a Master in heaven , Eph 6:9 ) ; and above all the initial principle of subordination to one another under Christ , thus effectively undermining exclusive claims to domination by one party . Into the section on wives and husbands an elaborate teaching on Christ and the church has been woven ( Eph 5:22–33 ) . - 5:21–33 The apostle exhorts married Christians to a strong mutual love . Holding with Gn 2:24 that marriage is a divine institution ( Eph 5:31 ) , Paul sees Christian marriage as taking on a new meaning symbolic of the intimate relationship of love between Christ and the church . The wife should serve her husband in the same spirit as that of the church ’ s service to Christ ( Eph 5:22 ,
NABRE	Ephesians	5	2	and live in love , as Christ loved us and handed himself over for us as a sacrificial offering to God for a fragrant aroma . ( B )

NABRE	Ephesians	5	11	Take no part in the fruitless works of darkness ; rather expose them , ( J )
NABRE	Ephesians	5	12	for it is shameful even to mention the things done by them in secret ;
NABRE	Ephesians	5	13	but everything exposed by the light becomes visible , ( K )
NABRE	Ephesians	5	14	for everything that becomes visible is light . Therefore , it says : ( L ) “ Awake , O sleeper , and arise from the dead , and Christ will give you light. ” [ c ]

NABRE	Ephesians	5	24	) , and the husband should care for his wife with the devotion of Christ to the church ( Eph 5:25–30 ) . Paul gives to the Genesis passage its highest meaning in the light of the union of Christ and the church , of which Christlike loyalty and devotion in Christian marriage are a clear reflection ( Eph 5:31–33 ) .

Drawing upon the imagery and ideas of Is 11:5 ; 59:16–17 ; and Wis 5:17–23 , Paul describes the Christian in terms of the dress and equipment of Roman soldiers . He observes , however , that the Christian ’ s readiness for combat is not directed against human beings but against the spiritual powers of evil ( Eph 6:10–17 ; cf . Eph 1:21 ; 2:2 ; 3:10 ) . Unique importance is placed upon prayer ( Eph 6:18–20 ) . - 6:21–24 Tychicus : the bearer of the letter ; see note on Col 4:7 . Eph 6:21–22 parallel Col 4:7–8 , often word for word .

The diakonoi at Philippi seem to represent an earlier stage of development of the office ; we are uncertain about their precise functions . Hence the term is here translated as ministers . See Rom 16:1 , where Phoebe is described as a diakonos ( minister ) of the church of Cenchreae . - 1:2 The gifts come from Christ the Lord , not simply through him from the Father ; compare the christology in Phil 2:6–11 . - 1:3–11 As in Rom 1:8–15 and all the Pauline letters except Galatians , a thanksgiving follows , including a direct prayer for the Philippians ( Phil 1:9–11 ) ; see note on Rom 1:8 .

NABRE	Philippians	1	15	Of course , some preach Christ from envy and rivalry , others from good will .
NABRE	Philippians	1	16	The latter act out of love , aware that I am here for the defense of the gospel ;
NABRE	Philippians	1	17	the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition , not from pure motives , thinking that they will cause me trouble in my imprisonment .
NABRE	Philippians	1	18	What difference does it make , as long as in every way , whether in pretense or in truth , Christ is being proclaimed ? ( K ) And in that I rejoice . [ i ] Indeed I shall continue to rejoice ,
NABRE	Philippians	1	19	[ j ] for I know that this will result in deliverance for me [ k ] through your prayers and support from the Spirit of Jesus Christ . ( L )
NABRE	Philippians	1	20	My eager expectation and hope is that I shall not be put to shame in any way , but that with all boldness , now as always , Christ will be magnified in my body , whether by life or by death . ( M )
NABRE	Philippians	1	21	For to me life is Christ , and death is gain . ( N )
NABRE	Philippians	1	22	If I go on living in the flesh , that means fruitful labor for me . And I do not know which I shall choose . ( O )
NABRE	Philippians	1	23	I am caught between the two . I long to depart this life and be with Christ , [ for ] that is far better . ( P )

The opponents ( Phil 1:28 ) are those in Philippi , probably pagans , who oppose the gospel cause . This is proof . ..

NABRE	Philippians	1	28	not intimidated in any way by your opponents . This is proof to them of destruction , but of your salvation . And this is God ’ s doing .

[ m ] Footnotes - 1:1–2 See note on Rom 1:1–7 , concerning the greeting . - 1:1 Slaves : Paul usually refers to himself at the start of a letter as an apostle . Here he substitutes a term suggesting the unconditional obligation of himself and Timothy to the service of Christ , probably because , in view of the good relationship with the Philippians , he wishes to stress his status as a co-servant rather than emphasize his apostolic authority . Reference to Timothy is a courtesy : Paul alone writes the letter , as the singular verb throughout shows ( Phil 1:3–26 ) , and the reference ( Phil 2:19–24 ) to Timothy in the third person . Overseers : the Greek term episkopos literally means “ one who oversees ” or “ one who supervises , ” but since the second century it has come to designate the “ bishop , ” the official who heads a local church . In New Testament times this office had not yet developed into the form that it later assumed , though it seems to be well on the way to such development in the Pastorals ; see

NABRE	Philippians	2	7	as dealing with Christ ’ s preexistence and Phil 2:8 with his incarnate life , so that lines Phil 2:7b , 7c are parallel , it is also possible to interpret so as to exclude any reference to preexistence ( see note on Phil 2:6 ) and to take Phil 2:6–8 as presenting two parallel stanzas about Jesus ’ human state ( Phil 2:6–7b ; 7cd–8 ) ; in the latter alternative , coming in human likeness begins the second stanza and parallels 6a to some extent . - 2:8 There may be reflected here language about the servant of the Lord , Is 52:13–53:12 especially Is 53:12 . - 2:9 The name : “ Lord ” ( Phil 2:11 ) , revealing the true nature of the one who is named . - 2:10–11 Every knee should bend…every tongue confess : into this language of Is 45:23 there has been inserted a reference to the three levels in the universe , according to ancient thought , heaven , earth , under the earth . - 2:11 Jesus Christ is Lord : a common early Christian acclamation ; cf .

Many see an allusion to the Genesis story : unlike Adam , Jesus , though…in the form of God ( Gn 1:26–27 ) , did not reach out for equality with God , in contrast with the first Adam in Gn 3:5–6 . - 2:7 Taking the form of a slave , coming in human likeness : or “ …taking the form of a slave .

NABRE	Philippians	2	26	For he has been longing for all of you and was distressed because you heard that he was ill.
NABRE	Philippians	2	27	He was indeed ill , close to death ; but God had mercy on him , not just on him but also on me , so that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow .
NABRE	Philippians	2	28	I send him therefore with the greater eagerness , so that , on seeing him , you may rejoice again , and I may have less anxiety .

Footnotes - 2:1–11 The admonition to likemindedness and unity ( Phil 2:2–5 ) is based on the believers ’ threefold experience with Christ , God ’ s love , and the Spirit . The appeal to humility ( Phil 2:3 ) and to obedience ( Phil 2:12 ) is rooted in christology , specifically in a statement about Christ Jesus ( Phil 2:6–11 ) and his humbling of self and obedience to the point of death ( Phil 2:8 ) . - 2:5 Have…the same attitude that is also yours in Christ Jesus : or , “ that also Christ Jesus had. ” While it is often held that Christ here functions as a model for moral imitation , it is not the historical Jesus but the entire Christ event that Phil 2:6–11 depict . Therefore , the appeal is to have in relations among yourselves that same relationship you have in Jesus Christ , i.e. , serving one another as you serve Christ ( Phil 2:4 ) . - 2:6–11 Perhaps an early Christian hymn quoted here by Paul . The short rhythmic lines fall into two parts , Phil 2:6–8 where the subject of every verb is Christ , and Phil 2:9–11 where the subject is God . The general pattern is thus of Christ ’ s humiliation and then exaltation . More precise analyses propose a division into six three-line stanzas ( Phil 2:6 ; 7abc , 7d–8 ,

He presents his own experience in coming to know Christ Jesus in terms of righteousness or justification ( cf . Rom 1:16–17 ; 3:21–5:11 ; Gal 2:5–11 ) , contrasting the righteousness from God through faith and that of one ’ s own based on the law as two exclusive ways of pleasing God . - 3:2 Beware of the mutilation : literally , “ incision , ” an ironic wordplay on “ circumcision ” ; cf .

The chapter describes these teachers in strong terms as dogs . The persons meant are evidently different from the rival preachers of Phil 1:14–18 and the opponents of Phil 1:28 . Since Phil 3:2–4 emphasize Jewish terms like circumcision ( Phil 3:2–3 ,

His reevaluation indicates the profound and lasting effect of his experience of the meaning of Christ on the way to Damascus some twenty years before ( Gal 1:15–16 ; Acts 9:1–22 ) . - 3:12–16 To be taken possession of by Christ does not mean that one has already arrived at perfect spiritual maturity . Paul and the Philippians instead press on , trusting in God . - 3:12 Attained perfect maturity : possibly an echo of the concept in the mystery religions of being an initiate , admitted to divine secrets . - 3:16 Some manuscripts add , probably to explain Paul ’ s cryptic phrase , “ thinking alike. ” - 3:17–21 Paul and those who live a life centered in Christ , envisaging both his suffering and resurrection , provide a model that is the opposite of opponents who reject Christ ’ s cross ( cf .

The apostle , recalling his own prayers for them and the good report about them he has received ( Col 1:3–4 ) , congratulates the Colossians upon their acceptance of Christ and their faithful efforts to live the gospel ( Col 3:6–8 ) . To encourage them he mentions the success of the gospel elsewhere ( Col 1:6 ) and assures them that his knowledge of their community is accurate , since he has been in personal contact with Epaphras ( Col 1:7–8 ) , who likely had evangelized Colossae and other cities in the Lycus Valley of Asia Minor ( cf .

NABRE	Colossians	2	1	For I want you to know how great a struggle I am having for you and for those in Laodicea [ a ] and all who have not seen me face to face ,
NABRE	Colossians	2	3	in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge . ( B ) III . Warnings Against False Teachers [ b ] A General Admonition .
NABRE	Colossians	2	4	I say this so that no one may deceive you by specious arguments . ( C )
NABRE	Colossians	2	5	For even if I am absent in the flesh , yet I am with you in spirit , rejoicing as I observe your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ . ( D )
NABRE	Colossians	2	6	So , as you received Christ Jesus the Lord , walk in him ,
NABRE	Colossians	2	7	rooted in him and built upon him and established in the faith as you were taught , abounding in thanksgiving . ( E )
NABRE	Colossians	2	8	See to it that no one captivate you with an empty , seductive philosophy according to human tradition , according to the elemental powers of the world [ c ] and not according to Christ . ( F ) Sovereign Role of Christ .
NABRE	Colossians	2	9	( G ) For in him dwells the whole fullness of the deity [ d ] bodily ,
NABRE	Colossians	2	10	and you share in this fullness in him , who is the head of every principality and power .
NABRE	Colossians	2	11	( H ) In him [ e ] you were also circumcised with a circumcision not administered by hand , by stripping off the carnal body , with the circumcision of Christ .
NABRE	Colossians	2	12	You were buried with him in baptism , in which you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God , who raised him from the dead . ( I )
NABRE	Colossians	2	13	( J ) And even when you were dead [ in ] transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh , he brought you to life along with him , having forgiven us all our transgressions ;
NABRE	Colossians	2	14	[ f ] obliterating the bond against us , with its legal claims , which was opposed to us , he also removed it from our midst , nailing it to the cross ; ( K )
NABRE	Colossians	2	15	despoiling the principalities and the powers , he made a public spectacle of them , ( L ) leading them away in triumph by it . [ g ] Practices Contrary to Faith .
NABRE	Colossians	2	16	; Rev 3:14–22 . - 2:4–23 In face of the threat posed by false teachers ( Col 2:4 ) , the Colossians are admonished to adhere to the gospel as it was first preached to them ( Col 2:6 ) , steeping themselves in it with grateful hearts ( Col 2:7 ) . They must reject religious teachings originating in any source except the gospel ( Col 2:8 ) because in Christ alone will they have access to God , the deity ( Col 2:9 ) . So fully has Christ enlightened them that they need no other source of religious knowledge or virtue ( Col 2:10 ) . They do not require circumcision ( Col 2:11 ) , for in baptism their whole being has been affected by Christ ( Col 2:12 ) through forgiveness of sin and resurrection to a new life ( Col 2:13 ; cf . Col 3:1 and Rom 6:1–11 ) . On the cross Christ canceled the record of the debt that stood against us with all its claims ( Col 2:14 ) , i.e. , he eliminated the law ( cf . Eph 2:15 ) that human beings could not observe—and that could not save them . He forgave sins against the law ( Col 2:14 ) and exposed as false and misleading ( Col 2:15 ) all other powers ( cf . Col 1:16 ) that purport to offer salvation . Therefore , the Colossians are not to accept judgments from such teachers on food and drink or to keep certain religious festivals or engage in certain cultic practices ( Col 2:16 ) , for the Colossians would thereby risk severing themselves from Christ ( Col 2:19 ) . If , when they accepted the gospel , they believed in Christ as their savior , they must be convinced that their salvation can not be achieved by appeasing ruling spirits through dietary practices or through a wisdom gained simply by means of harsh asceticism ( Col 2:20–23 ) . - 2:8 Elemental powers of the world : see note on Gal 4:3 . - 2:9 Fullness of the deity : the divine nature , not just attributes ; see note on Col 1:19 . - 2:11 A description of baptism ( Col 2:12 ) in symbolic terms of the Old Testament rite for entry into the community . The false teachers may have demanded physical circumcision of the Colossians . - 2:14 The elaborate metaphor here about how God canceled the legal claims against us through Christ ’ s cross depicts not Christ being nailed to the cross by men but the bond…with its legal claims being nailed to the cross by God . - 2:15 The picture derives from the public spectacle and triumph of a Roman emperor ’ s victory parade , where captives marched in subjection . The principalities and the powers are here conquered , not reconciled ( cf . Col 1:16 ,
NABRE	Colossians	2	17	These are shadows of things to come ; the reality belongs to Christ . ( N )
NABRE	Colossians	2	18	Let no one disqualify you , delighting in self-abasement and worship of angels , taking his stand on visions , [ i ] inflated without reason by his fleshly mind , ( O )

Col 2:8 ) . - 2:18 Ascetic practices encouraged by the false teachers included subjection of self humbly to their rules , worship of angels , and cultivation of visions , though exact details are unclear .

See note on Eph 5:21–6:9 . - 3:22–25 Slaves : within this table of duties in family and societal relations , involving wives and husbands , children and parents ( Col 3:18–21 ) , such as also appears in Eph 5:22–6:9 , slaves here receive special attention because of the case of Onesimus the slave returning to his master ( Col 4:9 ; Phlm 10–12 ) .

Eph 6:1–9 ; Col 3:18–4:1 . - 2:11–15 Underlying the admonitions for moral improvement in Ti 2:1–10 as the moving force is the constant appeal to God ’ s revelation of salvation in Christ , with its demand for transformation of life . - 2:13 The blessed hope , the appearance : literally , “ the blessed hope and appearance , ” but the use of a single article in Greek strongly suggests an epexegetical , i.e. , explanatory sense .

NABRE	Hebrews	1	1	In times past , God spoke in partial and various ways to our ancestors through the prophets ;
NABRE	Hebrews	1	2	in these last days , he spoke to us through a son , whom he made heir of all things and through whom he created the universe , ( A )
NABRE	Hebrews	1	3	who is the refulgence of his glory , the very imprint of his being , and who sustains all things by his mighty word . When he had accomplished purification from sins , he took his seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high , ( B )

NABRE	Hebrews	1	5	For to which of the angels did God ever say : “ You are my son ; this day I have begotten you ” ? ( D ) Or again : “ I will be a father to him , and he shall be a son to me ” ?
NABRE	Hebrews	1	6	And again , when he leads [ c ] the first-born into the world , he says : “ Let all the angels of God worship him. ” ( E )
NABRE	Hebrews	1	7	Of the angels he says : “ He makes his angels winds and his ministers a fiery flame ” ; ( F )
NABRE	Hebrews	1	8	but of the Son : “ Your throne , O God , [ d ] stands forever and ever ; and a righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom . ( G )
NABRE	Hebrews	1	9	You loved justice and hated wickedness ; therefore God , your God , anointed you with the oil of gladness above your companions ” ;
NABRE	Hebrews	1	10	and : “ At the beginning , O Lord , you established the earth , ( H ) and the heavens are the works of your hands .
NABRE	Hebrews	1	11	They will perish , but you remain ; and they will all grow old like a garment .
NABRE	Hebrews	1	12	You will roll them up like a cloak , and like a garment they will be changed . But you are the same , and your years will have no end. ”
NABRE	Hebrews	1	13	were traditionally used of Jesus ’ messianic sonship ( cf . Acts 13:33 ) through his resurrection and exaltation ( cf . Acts 2:33–35 ) ; those in Hb 1:8 , 10–12 are concerned with his divine kingship and his creative function . The central quotation in Hb 1:7 serves to contrast the angels with the Son . The author quotes it according to the Septuagint translation , which is quite different in meaning from that of the Hebrew ( “ You make the winds your messengers , and flaming fire your ministers ” ) . The angels are only sent to serve…those who are to inherit salvation ( Hb 1:14 ) . - 1:6 And again , when he leads : the Greek could also be translated “ And when he again leads ” in reference to the parousia . - 1:8–12 O God : the application of the name “ God ” to the Son derives from the preexistence mentioned in Hb 1:2–3 ; the psalmist had already used it of the Hebrew king in the court style of the original . See note on Ps 45:7 . It is also important for the author ’ s christology that in Hb 1:10–12 an Old Testament passage addressed to God is redirected to Jesus . Scripture texts , prefaces , introductions , footnotes and cross references used in this work are taken from the New American Bible , revised edition ©
NABRE	Hebrews	1	14	Are they not all ministering spirits sent to serve , for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation ? ( J ) Footnotes - 1:1–4 The letter opens with an introduction consisting of a reflection on the climax of God ’ s revelation to the human race in his Son . The divine communication was initiated and maintained during Old Testament times in fragmentary and varied ways through the prophets ( Hb 1:1 ) , including Abraham , Moses , and all through whom God spoke . But now in these last days ( Hb 1:2 ) the final age , God ’ s revelation of his saving purpose is achieved through a son , i.e. , one who is Son , whose role is redeemer and mediator of creation . He was made heir of all things through his death and exaltation to glory , yet he existed before he appeared as man ; through him God created the universe . Hb 1:3–4 , which may be based upon a liturgical hymn , assimilate the Son to the personified Wisdom of the Old Testament as refulgence of God ’ s glory and imprint of his being ( Hb 1:3 ; cf . Wis 7:26 ) . These same terms are used of the Logos in Philo . The author now turns from the cosmological role of the preexistent Son to the redemptive work of Jesus : he brought about purification from sins and has been exalted to the right hand of God ( see Ps 110:1 ) . The once-humiliated and crucified Jesus has been declared God ’ s Son , and this name shows his superiority to the angels . The reason for the author ’ s insistence on that superiority is , among other things , that in some Jewish traditions angels were mediators of the old covenant ( see Acts 7:53 ; Gal 3:19 ) . Finally , Jesus ’ superiority to the angels emphasizes the superiority of the new covenant to the old because of the heavenly priesthood of Jesus . - 1:5–14 Jesus ’ superiority to the angels is now demonstrated by a series of seven Old Testament texts . Some scholars see in the stages of Jesus ’ exaltation an order corresponding to that of enthronement ceremonies in the ancient Near East , especially in Egypt , namely , elevation to divine status ( Hb 1:5–6 ) ; presentation to the angels and proclamation of everlasting lordship ( Hb 1:7–12 ) ; enthronement and conferral of royal power ( Hb 1:13 ) . The citations from the Psalms in Hb 1:5 ,

NABRE	Hebrews	2	2	For if the word announced through angels proved firm , and every transgression and disobedience received its just recompense , ( A )
NABRE	Hebrews	2	1	Pt 3:22 . This christological interpretation , therefore , probably reflects a common early Christian tradition , which may have originated in the expression the son of man ( Hb 2:6 ) . The psalm contrasts God ’ s greatness with man ’ s relative insignificance but also stresses the superiority of man to the rest of creation , of which he is lord . Hebrews applies this christologically : Jesus lived a truly human existence , lower than the angels , in the days of his earthly life , particularly in his suffering and death ; now , crowned with glory and honor , he is raised above all creation . The author considers all things as already subject to him because of his exaltation ( Hb 2:8–9 ) , though we do not see this yet . The reference to Jesus as leader ( Hb 2:10 ) sounds the first note of an important leitmotif in Hebrews : the journey of the people of God to the sabbath rest ( Hb 4:9 ) , the heavenly sanctuary , following Jesus , their “ forerunner ” ( Hb 6:20 ) . It was fitting that God should make him perfect through suffering , consecrated by obedient suffering . Because he is perfected as high priest , Jesus is then able to consecrate his people ( Hb 2:11 ) ; access to God is made possible by each of these two consecrations . If Jesus is able to help human beings , it is because he has become one of us ; we are his “ brothers. ” The author then cites three Old Testament texts as proofs of this unity between ourselves and the Son . Ps 22:23 is interpreted so as to make Jesus the singer of this lament , which ends with joyful praise of the Lord in the assembly of “ brothers. ” The other two texts are from Is 8:17 ,
NABRE	Hebrews	2	3	how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation ? Announced originally through the Lord , it was confirmed for us by those who had heard . ( B )
NABRE	Hebrews	2	4	God added his testimony by signs , wonders , various acts of power , and distribution of the gifts of the holy Spirit according to his will . ( C ) Exaltation Through Abasement . [ b ]
NABRE	Hebrews	2	5	For it was not to angels that he subjected the world to come , of which we are speaking .
NABRE	Hebrews	2	6	Instead , someone has testified somewhere : “ What is man that you are mindful of him , or the son of man that you care for him ? ( D )
NABRE	Hebrews	2	7	You made him for a little while lower than the angels ; you crowned him with glory and honor ,
NABRE	Hebrews	2	8	subjecting all things under his feet. ” In “ subjecting ” all things [ to him ] , he left nothing not “ subject to him. ” Yet at present we do not see “ all things subject to him , ” ( E )
NABRE	Hebrews	2	9	but we do see Jesus “ crowned with glory and honor ” because he suffered death , he who “ for a little while ” was made “ lower than the angels , ” that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone . ( F )
NABRE	Hebrews	2	10	For it was fitting that he , for whom and through whom all things exist , in bringing many children to glory , should make the leader to their salvation perfect through suffering . ( G )
NABRE	Hebrews	2	11	He who consecrates and those who are being consecrated all have one origin . Therefore , he is not ashamed to call them “ brothers , ”
NABRE	Hebrews	2	12	saying : “ I will proclaim your name to my brothers , in the midst of the assembly I will praise you ” ; ( H )
NABRE	Hebrews	2	13	and again : “ I will put my trust in him ” ; and again : “ Behold , I and the children God has given me. ” ( I )
NABRE	Hebrews	2	14	Now since the children share in blood and flesh , he likewise shared in them , that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death , that is , the devil , ( J )
NABRE	Hebrews	2	15	and free those who through fear of death had been subject to slavery all their life .
NABRE	Hebrews	2	16	Surely he did not help angels but rather the descendants of Abraham ;
NABRE	Hebrews	2	17	therefore , he had to become like his brothers in every way , that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest before God to expiate the sins of the people . ( K )
NABRE	Hebrews	2	18	. The first of these seems intended to display in Jesus an example of the trust in God that his followers should emulate . The second curiously calls these followers “ children ” ; probably this is to be understood to mean children of Adam , but the point is our solidarity with Jesus . By sharing human nature , including the ban of death , Jesus broke the power of the devil over death ( Hb 2:14 ) ; the author shares the view of Hellenistic Judaism that death was not intended by God and that it had been introduced into the world by the devil . The fear of death ( Hb 2:15 ) is a religious fear based on the false conception that death marks the end of a person ’ s relations with God ( cf . Ps 115:17–18 ; Is 38:18 ) . Jesus deliberately allied himself with the descendants of Abraham ( Hb 2:16 ) in order to be a merciful and faithful high priest . This is the first appearance of the central theme of Hebrews , Jesus the great high priest expiating the sins of the people ( Hb 2:17 ) , as one who experienced the same tests as they ( Hb 2:18 ) .

NABRE	Hebrews	3	1	Cor 10:1–4 ) . The author cites Ps 95:7–11 , a salutary example of hardness of heart , as a warning against the danger of growing weary and giving up the journey . To call God living ( Hb 3:12 ) means that he reveals himself in his works ( cf . Jos 3:10 ; Jer 10:11 ) . The rest ( Hb 3:11 ) into which Israel was to enter was only a foreshadowing of that rest to which Christians are called . They are to remember the example of Israel ’ s revolt in the desert that cost a whole generation the loss of the promised land ( Hb 3:15–19 ; cf . Nm 14:20–29 ) . In Hb 4:1–11 , the symbol of rest is seen in deeper dimension : because the promise to the ancient Hebrews foreshadowed that given to Christians , it is good news ; and because the promised land was the place of rest that God provided for his people , it was a share in his own rest , which he enjoyed after he had finished his creative work ( Hb 3:3–4 ; cf . Gn 2:2 ) . The author attempts to read this meaning of God ’ s rest into Ps 95:7–11 ( Hb 3:6–9 ) . The Greek form of the name of Joshua , who led Israel into the promised land , is Jesus ( Hb 3:8 ) . The author plays upon the name but stresses the superiority of Jesus , who leads his followers into heavenly rest . Hb 3:12 ,
NABRE	Hebrews	3	2	who was faithful to the one who appointed him , just as Moses was “ faithful in [ all ] his house. ” ( A )
NABRE	Hebrews	3	4	Every house is founded by someone , but the founder of all is God .
NABRE	Hebrews	3	5	,
NABRE	Hebrews	3	6	) means God ’ s house , not that of Moses or Christ ; in the case of Christ , compare Hb 3:6 with Hb 10:21 . The house of Hb 3:6 is the Christian community ; the author suggests its continuity with Israel by speaking not of two houses but of only one . Hb 3:6 brings out the reason why Jesus is superior to Moses : the latter was the faithful servant laboring in the house founded by God , but Jesus is God ’ s son , placed over the house . - 3:6 The majority of manuscripts add “ firm to the end , ” but these words are not found in the three earliest and best witnesses and are probably an interpolation derived from Hb 3:14 . - 3:7–4:13 The author appeals for steadfastness of faith in Jesus , basing his warning on the experience of Israel during the Exodus . In the Old Testament the Exodus had been invoked as a symbol of the return of Israel from the Babylonian exile ( Is 42:9 ; 43:16–21 ; 51:9–11 ) . In the New Testament the redemption was similarly understood as a new exodus , both in the experience of Jesus himself ( Lk 9:31 ) and in that of his followers (
NABRE	Hebrews	3	7	[ c ] Therefore , as the holy Spirit says : “ Oh , that today you would hear his voice , ( D )
NABRE	Hebrews	3	8	‘ Harden not your hearts as at the rebellion in the day of testing in the desert ,
NABRE	Hebrews	3	9	where your ancestors tested and tried me and saw my works ( E )
NABRE	Hebrews	3	10	for forty years . Because of this I was provoked with that generation and I said , “ They have always been of erring heart , and they do not know my ways. ”
NABRE	Hebrews	3	11	As I swore in my wrath , “ They shall not enter into my rest. ” ’ ”
NABRE	Hebrews	3	12	Take care , brothers , that none of you may have an evil and unfaithful heart , so as to forsake the living God .
NABRE	Hebrews	3	13	are meant as a continuation of the warning , for the word of God brings judgment as well as salvation . Some would capitalize the word of God and see it as a personal title of Jesus , comparable to that of Jn 1:1–18 .

NABRE	Hebrews	3	14	We have become partners of Christ if only we hold the beginning of the reality firm until the end , ( F )
NABRE	Hebrews	3	15	for it is said : “ Oh , that today you would hear his voice : ‘ Harden not your hearts as at the rebellion. ’ ” ( G )
NABRE	Hebrews	3	16	( H ) Who were those who rebelled when they heard ? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt under Moses ?
NABRE	Hebrews	3	17	With whom was he “ provoked for forty years ” ? Was it not those who had sinned , whose corpses fell in the desert ? ( I )
NABRE	Hebrews	3	18	And to whom did he “ swear that they should not enter into his rest , ” if not to those who were disobedient ? ( J )
NABRE	Hebrews	3	19	And we see that they could not enter for lack of faith . Footnotes - 3:1–6 The author now takes up the two qualities of Jesus mentioned in Hb 2:17 , but in inverse order : faithfulness ( Hb 3:1–4:13 ) and mercy ( Hb 4:14–5:10 ) . Christians are called holy “ brothers ” because of their common relation to him ( Hb 2:11 ) , the apostle , a designation for Jesus used only here in the New Testament ( cf . Jn 13:16 ; 17:3 ) , meaning one sent as God ’ s final word to us ( Hb 1:2 ) . He is compared with Moses probably because he is seen as mediator of the new covenant ( Hb 9:15 ) just as Moses was of the old ( Hb 9:19–22 , including his sacrifice ) . But when the author of Hebrews speaks of Jesus ’ sacrifice , he does not consider Moses as the Old Testament antitype , but rather the high priest on the Day of Atonement ( Hb 9:6–15 ) . Moses ’ faithfulness “ in [ all ] his house ” refers back to Nm 12:7 , on which this section is a midrashic commentary . In Hb 3:3–6 , the author does not indicate that he thinks of either Moses or Christ as the founder of the household . His house ( Hb 3:2 ,

NABRE	Hebrews	4	4	For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this manner , “ And God rested on the seventh day from all his works ” ; ( B )
NABRE	Hebrews	4	1	Therefore , let us be on our guard while the promise of entering into his rest remains , that none of you seem to have failed .
NABRE	Hebrews	4	2	For in fact we have received the good news just as they did . But the word that they heard did not profit them , for they were not united in faith with those who listened .
NABRE	Hebrews	4	3	For we who believed enter into [ that ] rest , just as he has said : ( A ) “ As I swore in my wrath , ‘ They shall not enter into my rest , ’ ” and yet his works were accomplished at the foundation of the world .
NABRE	Hebrews	4	5	and again , in the previously mentioned place , “ They shall not enter into my rest. ” ( C )
NABRE	Hebrews	4	6	Therefore , since it remains that some will enter into it , and those who formerly received the good news did not enter because of disobedience ,
NABRE	Hebrews	4	7	he once more set a day , “ today , ” when long afterwards he spoke through David , as already quoted : ( D ) “ Oh , that today you would hear his voice : ‘ Harden not your hearts. ’ ”
NABRE	Hebrews	4	8	Now if Joshua had given them rest , he would not have spoken afterwards of another day . ( E )
NABRE	Hebrews	4	9	Therefore , a sabbath rest still remains for the people of God .
NABRE	Hebrews	4	10	And whoever enters into God ’ s rest , rests from his own works as God did from his .
NABRE	Hebrews	4	11	Therefore , let us strive to enter into that rest , so that no one may fall after the same example of disobedience .
NABRE	Hebrews	4	12	Indeed , the word of God is living and effective , sharper than any two-edged sword , penetrating even between soul and spirit , joints and marrow , and able to discern reflections and thoughts of the heart . ( F )
NABRE	Hebrews	4	13	No creature is concealed from him , but everything is naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must render an account . ( G ) Jesus , Compassionate High Priest .
NABRE	Hebrews	4	14	[ a ] Therefore , since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens , Jesus , the Son of God , let us hold fast to our confession . ( H )
NABRE	Hebrews	4	15	For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses , but one who has similarly been tested in every way , yet without sin . ( I )
NABRE	Hebrews	4	16	So let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help . ( J ) Footnotes - 4:14–16 These verses , which return to the theme first sounded in Hb 2:16–3:1 , serve as an introduction to the section that follows . The author here alone calls Jesus a great high priest ( Hb 4:14 ) , a designation used by Philo for the Logos ; perhaps he does so in order to emphasize Jesus ’ superiority over the Jewish high priest . He has been tested in every way , yet without sin ( Hb 4:15 ) ; this indicates an acquaintance with the tradition of Jesus ’ temptations , not only at the beginning ( as in Mk 1:13 ) but throughout his public life ( cf . Lk 22:28 ) . Although the reign of the exalted Jesus is a theme that occurs elsewhere in Hebrews , and Jesus ’ throne is mentioned in Hb 1:8 , the throne of grace ( Hb 4:16 ) refers to the throne of God . The similarity of Hb 4:16 to Hb 10:19–22 indicates that the author is thinking of our confident access to God , made possible by the priestly work of Jesus .

NABRE	Hebrews	5	5	In the same way , it was not Christ who glorified himself in becoming high priest , but rather the one who said to him : “ You are my son ; this day I have begotten you ” ; ( C )
NABRE	Hebrews	5	1	[ a ] Every high priest is taken from among men and made their representative before God , to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins . [ b ]

The author is concerned especially about their persevering ( Hb 6:11–12 ) , citing in this regard the achievement of Abraham , who relied on God ’ s promise and on God ’ s oath ( Hb 6:13–18 ; cf . Gn 22:16 ) , and proposes to them as a firm anchor of Christian hope the high priesthood of Christ , who is now living with God ( Hb 6:19–20 ) .

NABRE	Hebrews	5	11	[ g ] About this we have much to say , and it is difficult to explain , for you have become sluggish in hearing .
NABRE	Hebrews	5	12	Although you should be teachers by this time , you need to have someone teach you again the basic elements of the utterances of God . You need milk , [ and ] not solid food . ( I )
NABRE	Hebrews	5	13	Everyone who lives on milk lacks experience of the word of righteousness , for he is a child .
NABRE	Hebrews	5	14	But solid food is for the mature , for those whose faculties are trained by practice to discern good and evil . Footnotes - 5:1–10 The true humanity of Jesus ( see note on Hb 2:5–18 ) makes him a more rather than a less effective high priest to the Christian community . In Old Testament tradition , the high priest was identified with the people , guilty of personal sin just as they were ( Hb 5:1–3 ) . Even so , the office was of divine appointment ( Hb 5:4 ) , as was also the case with the sinless Christ ( Hb 5:5 ) . For Hb 5:6 , see note on Ps 110:4 . Although Jesus was Son of God , he was destined as a human being to learn obedience by accepting the suffering he had to endure ( Hb 5:8 ) . Because of his perfection through this experience of human suffering , he is the cause of salvation for all ( Hb 5:9 ) , a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek ( Hb 5:10 ; cf . Hb 5:6 and Hb 7:3 ) . - 5:1 To offer gifts and sacrifices for sins : the author is thinking principally of the Day of Atonement rite , as is clear from Hb 9:7 . This ritual was celebrated to atone for “ all the sins of the Israelites ” ( Lv 16:34 ) . - 5:2 Deal patiently : the Greek word metriopathein occurs only here in the Bible ; this term was used by the Stoics to designate the golden mean between excess and defect of passion . Here it means rather the ability to sympathize . - 5:6–8 The author of Hebrews is the only New Testament writer to cite Ps 110:4 , here and in Hb 7:17 ,
NABRE	Hebrews	5	21	, to show that Jesus has been called by God to his role as priest . Hb 5:7–8 deal with his ability to sympathize with sinners , because of his own experience of the trials and weakness of human nature , especially fear of death . In his present exalted state , weakness is foreign to him , but he understands what we suffer because of his previous earthly experience . - 5:7 He offered prayers…to the one who was able to save him from death : at Gethsemane ( cf . Mk 14:35 ) , though some see a broader reference ( see note on Jn 12:27 ) . - 5:8 Son though he was : two different though not incompatible views of Jesus ’ sonship coexist in Hebrews , one associating it with his exaltation , the other with his preexistence . The former view is the older one ( cf . Rom 1:4 ) . - 5:11–6:20 The central section of Hebrews ( 5:11–10:39 ) opens with a reprimand and an appeal . Those to whom the author directs his teaching about Jesus ’ priesthood , which is difficult to explain , have become sluggish in hearing and forgetful of even the basic elements ( Hb 5:12 ) . But rather than treating of basic teachings , the author apparently believes that the challenge of more advanced ones may shake them out of their inertia ( therefore , Hb 6:1 ) . The six examples of basic teaching in Hb 6:1–3 are probably derived from a traditional catechetical list . No effort is made to address apostates , for their very hostility to the Christian message cuts them off completely from Christ ( Hb 6:4–8 ) . This harsh statement seems to rule out repentance after apostasy , but perhaps the author deliberately uses hyperbole in order to stress the seriousness of abandoning Christ . With Hb 6:9 a milder tone is introduced , and the criticism of the community ( Hb 6:1–3 ,

NABRE	Hebrews	6	1	Cor 2:4 ) . - 6:6 They are recrucifying the Son of God for themselves : a colorful description of the malice of apostasy , which is portrayed as again crucifying and deriding the Son of God . - 6:12 Imitators of those…inheriting the promises : the author urges the addressees to imitate the faith of the holy people of the Old Testament , who now possess the promised goods of which they lived in hope . This theme will be treated fully in Hb 6:11 . - 6:13 He swore by himself : God ’ s promise to Abraham , which he confirmed by an oath ( “ I swear by myself , ” Gn 22:16 ) was the basis for the hope of all Abraham ’ s descendants . - 6:15 He obtained the promise : this probably refers not to Abraham ’ s temporary possession of the land but to the eschatological blessings that Abraham and the other patriarchs have now come to possess . - 6:18 Two immutable things : the promise and the oath , both made by God . - 6:19 Anchor…into the interior behind the veil : a mixed metaphor . The Holy of Holies , beyond the veil that separates it from the Holy Place ( Ex 26:31–33 ) , is seen as the earthly counterpart of the heavenly abode of God . This theme will be developed in Hb
NABRE	Hebrews	6	2	Tm 1:6 it is a means of conferring some ministry or mission in the early Christian community . - 6:4 Enlightened and tasted the heavenly gift : this may refer to baptism and the Eucharist , respectively , but more probably means the neophytes ’ enlightenment by faith and their experience of salvation . - 6:5 Tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come : the proclamation of the word of God was accompanied by signs of the Spirit ’ s power (

NABRE	Hebrews	7	7	Unquestionably , a lesser person is blessed by a greater . [ f ]
NABRE	Hebrews	7	1	[ a ] This “ Melchizedek , king of Salem and priest of God Most High , ” [ b ] “ met Abraham as he returned from his defeat of the kings ” and “ blessed him. ” ( A )
NABRE	Hebrews	7	2	Sm 14:22 ; Jb 31:20 ) . The author may intend it as a statement of a liturgical rule . - 7:9 Levi : for the author this name designates not only the son of Jacob mentioned in Genesis but the priestly tribe that was thought to be descended from him . - 7:11–14 The levitical priesthood was not typified by the priesthood of Melchizedek , for Ps 110:4 speaks of a priesthood of a new order , the order of Melchizedek , to arise in messianic times ( Hb 7:11 ) . Since the levitical priesthood served the Mosaic law , a new priesthood ( Hb 7:12 ) would not come into being without a change in the law itself . Thus Jesus was not associated with the Old Testament priesthood , for he was a descendant of the tribe of Judah , which had never exercised the priesthood ( Hb 7:13–14 ) . - 7:13 He of whom these things are said : Jesus , the priest “ according to the order of Melchizedek. ” According to the author ’ s interpretation , Ps
NABRE	Hebrews	7	3	Without father , mother , or ancestry , without beginning of days or end of life , [ d ] thus made to resemble the Son of God , he remains a priest forever . ( B )
NABRE	Hebrews	7	4	[ e ] See how great he is to whom the patriarch “ Abraham [ indeed ] gave a tenth ” of his spoils . ( C )
NABRE	Hebrews	7	5	The descendants of Levi who receive the office of priesthood have a commandment according to the law to exact tithes from the people , that is , from their brothers , although they also have come from the loins of Abraham . ( D )
NABRE	Hebrews	7	6	But he who was not of their ancestry received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had received the promises .
NABRE	Hebrews	7	8	In the one case , mortal men receive tithes ; in the other , a man of whom it is testified that he lives on .
NABRE	Hebrews	7	9	One might even say that Levi [ g ] himself , who receives tithes , was tithed through Abraham ,
NABRE	Hebrews	7	10	for he was still in his father ’ s loins when Melchizedek met him .
NABRE	Hebrews	7	11	[ h ] If , then , perfection came through the levitical priesthood , on the basis of which the people received the law , what need would there still have been for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek , and not reckoned according to the order of Aaron ? ( E )
NABRE	Hebrews	7	12	When there is a change of priesthood , there is necessarily a change of law as well .
NABRE	Hebrews	7	13	Now he of whom these things are said [ i ] belonged to a different tribe , of which no member ever officiated at the altar .
NABRE	Hebrews	7	14	, the Hebrew text does not state explicitly who gave tithes to whom . The author of Hebrews supplies Abraham as the subject , according to a contemporary interpretation of the passage . This supports the argument of the midrash and makes it possible to see in Melchizedek a type of Jesus . The messianic blessings of righteousness and peace are foreshadowed in the names “ Melchizedek ” and “ Salem. ” - 7:3 Without father , mother , or ancestry , without beginning of days or end of life : this is perhaps a quotation from a hymn about Melchizedek . The rabbis maintained that anything not mentioned in the Torah does not exist . Consequently , since the Old Testament nowhere mentions Melchizedek ’ s ancestry , birth , or death , the conclusion can be drawn that he remains…forever . - 7:4–10 The tithe that Abraham gave to Melchizedek ( Hb 7:4 ) , a practice later followed by the levitical priesthood ( Hb 7:5 ) , was a gift ( Hb 7:6 ) acknowledging a certain superiority in Melchizedek , the foreign priest ( Hb 7:7 ) . This is further indicated by the fact that the institution of the levitical priesthood was sustained by hereditary succession in the tribe of Levi , whereas the absence of any mention of Melchizedek ’ s death in Genesis implies that his personal priesthood is permanent ( Hb 7:8 ) . The levitical priesthood itself , through Abraham , its ancestor , paid tithes to Melchizedek , thus acknowledging the superiority of his priesthood over its own ( Hb 7:9–10 ) . - 7:7 A lesser person is blessed by a greater : though this sounds like a principle , there are some examples in the Old Testament that do not support it ( cf .
NABRE	Hebrews	7	15	[ k ] It is even more obvious if another priest is raised up after the likeness of Melchizedek ,
NABRE	Hebrews	7	16	,
NABRE	Hebrews	7	17	For it is testified : “ You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek. ” ( G )
NABRE	Hebrews	7	18	On the one hand , a former commandment is annulled because of its weakness and uselessness , ( H )
NABRE	Hebrews	7	19	for the law brought nothing to perfection ; on the other hand , a better hope [ m ] is introduced , through which we draw near to God .
NABRE	Hebrews	7	20	. - 7:20–25 As was the case with the promise to Abraham ( Hb 6:13 ) , though not with the levitical priesthood , the eternal priesthood of the order of Melchizedek was confirmed by God ’ s oath ( Hb 7:20–21 ) ; cf . Ps 110:4 . Thus Jesus becomes the guarantee of a permanent covenant ( Hb 7:22 ) that does not require a succession of priests as did the levitical priesthood ( Hb 7:23 ) because his high priesthood is eternal and unchangeable ( Hb 7:24 ) . Consequently , Jesus is able to save all who draw near to God through him since he is their ever-living intercessor ( Hb 7:25 ) . - 7:20 An oath : God ’ s oath in Ps 110:4 . - 7:22 An [ even ] better covenant : better than the Mosaic covenant because it will be eternal , like the priesthood of Jesus upon which it is based . Hb 7:12 argued that a change of priesthood involves a change of law ; since “ law ” and “ covenant ” are used correlatively , a new covenant is likewise instituted . - 7:25 To make intercession : the intercession of the exalted Jesus , not the sequel to his completed sacrifice but its eternal presence in heaven ; cf . Rom 8:34 . - 7:26 This verse with its list of attributes is reminiscent of Hb 7:3 and is perhaps a hymnic counterpart to it , contrasting the exalted Jesus with Melchizedek . - 7:26–28 Jesus is precisely the high priest whom the human race requires , holy and sinless , installed far above humanity ( Hb 7:26 ) ; one having no need to offer sacrifice daily for sins but making a single offering of himself ( Hb 7:27 ) once for all . The law could only appoint high priests with human limitations , but the fulfillment of God ’ s oath regarding the priesthood of Melchizedek ( Ps 110:4 ) makes the Son of God the perfect priest forever ( Hb 7:28 ) . - 7:27 Such daily sacrifice is nowhere mentioned in the Mosaic law ; only on the Day of Atonement is it prescribed that the high priest must offer sacrifice…for his own sins and then for those of the people ( Lv 16:11–19 ) . Once for all : this translates the Greek words ephapax/hapax that occur eleven times in Hebrews .

NABRE	Hebrews	7	21	but he with an oath , through the one who said to him : “ The Lord has sworn , and he will not repent : ( I ) ‘ You are a priest forever ’ ” —
NABRE	Hebrews	7	22	( J ) to that same degree has Jesus [ also ] become the guarantee of an [ even ] better covenant . [ p ]
NABRE	Hebrews	7	23	Those priests were many because they were prevented by death from remaining in office ,
NABRE	Hebrews	7	24	but he , because he remains forever , has a priesthood that does not pass away . ( K )

NABRE	Hebrews	7	26	( M ) It was fitting that we should have such a high priest : [ r ] holy , innocent , undefiled , separated from sinners , higher than the heavens . [ s ]

NABRE	Hebrews	7	28	For the law appoints men subject to weakness to be high priests , but the word of the oath , which was taken after the law , appoints a son , who has been made perfect forever . ( O ) Footnotes - 7:1–3 Recalling the meeting between Melchizedek and Abraham described in Gn 14:17–20 , the author enhances the significance of this priest by providing the popular etymological meaning of his name and that of the city over which he ruled ( Hb 7:2 ) . Since Genesis gives no information on the parentage or the death of Melchizedek , he is seen here as a type of Christ , representing a priesthood that is unique and eternal ( Hb 7:3 ) . - 7:1 The author here assumes that Melchizedek was a priest of the God of Israel ( cf . Gn 14:22 and the note there ) . - 7:2 In Gn

NABRE	Hebrews	8	8	But he finds fault with them and says : [ d ] “ Behold , the days are coming , says the Lord , ( G ) when I will conclude a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah .
NABRE	Hebrews	8	1	The main point of what has been said is this : we have such a high priest , who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven , ( A )
NABRE	Hebrews	8	2	a minister of the sanctuary [ b ] and of the true tabernacle that the Lord , not man , set up . ( B )
NABRE	Hebrews	8	3	Now every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices ; thus the necessity for this one also to have something to offer . ( C )
NABRE	Hebrews	8	4	If then he were on earth , he would not be a priest , since there are those who offer gifts according to the law . ( D )
NABRE	Hebrews	8	5	They worship in a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary , as Moses was warned when he was about to erect the tabernacle . For he says , “ See that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain. ” ( E )
NABRE	Hebrews	8	6	Now he has obtained so much more excellent a ministry as he is mediator of a better covenant , enacted on better promises . ( F ) Old and New Covenants . [ c ]
NABRE	Hebrews	8	7	For if that first covenant had been faultless , no place would have been sought for a second one .
NABRE	Hebrews	8	9	It will not be like the covenant I made with their fathers the day I took them by the hand to lead them forth from the land of Egypt ; for they did not stand by my covenant and I ignored them , says the Lord .
NABRE	Hebrews	8	10	But this is the covenant I will establish with the house of Israel after those days , says the Lord : I will put my laws in their minds and I will write them upon their hearts . I will be their God , and they shall be my people . ( H )

NABRE	Hebrews	8	13	[ e ] ( I ) When he speaks of a “ new ” covenant , he declares the first one obsolete . And what has become obsolete and has grown old is close to disappearing . Footnotes - 8:1–6 The Christian community has in Jesus the kind of high priest described in Hb 7:26–28 . In virtue of his ascension Jesus has taken his place at God ’ s right hand in accordance with Ps 110:1 ( Hb 8:1 ) , where he presides over the heavenly sanctuary established by God himself ( Hb 8:2 ) . Like every high priest , he has his offering to make ( Hb 8:3 ; cf . Hb 9:12 ,
NABRE	Hebrews	8	14	) , but it differs from that of the levitical priesthood in which he had no share ( Hb 8:4 ) and which was in any case but a shadowy reflection of the true offering in the heavenly sanctuary ( Hb 8:5 ) . But Jesus ’ ministry in the heavenly sanctuary is that of mediator of a superior covenant that accomplishes what it signifies ( Hb 8:6 ) . - 8:2 The sanctuary : the Greek term could also mean “ holy things ” but bears the meaning “ sanctuary ” elsewhere in Hebrews ( Hb 9:8 ,
NABRE	Hebrews	8	24	,
NABRE	Hebrews	8	25	; 10:19 ; 13:11 ) . The true tabernacle : the heavenly tabernacle that the Lord…set up is contrasted with the earthly tabernacle that Moses set up in the desert . True means “ real ” in contradistinction to a mere “ copy and shadow ” ( Hb 8:5 ) ; compare the Johannine usage ( e.g. , Jn 1:9 ; 6:32 ; 15:1 ) . The idea that the earthly sanctuary is a reflection of a heavenly model may be based upon Ex 25:9 , but probably also derives from the Platonic concept of a real world of which our observable world is merely a shadow . - 8:7–13 Since the first covenant was deficient in accomplishing what it signified , it had to be replaced ( Hb 8:7 ) , as Jeremiah ( Jer 31:31–34 ) had prophesied ( Hb 8:8–12 ) . Even in the time of Jeremiah , the first covenant was antiquated ( Hb 8:13 ) . In Hb 7:22–24 , the superiority of the new covenant was seen in the permanence of its priesthood ; here the superiority is based on better promises , made explicit in the citation of Jer 31:31–34 ( LXX :
NABRE	Hebrews	8	38	) , namely , in the immediacy of the people ’ s knowledge of God ( Hb 8:11 ) and in the forgiveness of sin ( Hb 8:12 ) . - 8:8–12 In citing Jeremiah the author follows the Septuagint ; some apparent departures from it may be the result of a different Septuagintal text rather than changes deliberately introduced . - 8:13 Close to disappearing : from the prophet ’ s perspective , not that of the author of Hebrews .

NABRE	Hebrews	9	9	This is a symbol of the present time , [ h ] in which gifts and sacrifices are offered that can not perfect the worshiper in conscience
NABRE	Hebrews	9	1	Cor 10:2 ) . - 9:9 The present time : this expression is equivalent to the “ present age , ” used in contradistinction to the “ age to come. ” - 9:11–14 Christ , the high priest of the spiritual blessings foreshadowed in the Old Testament sanctuary , has actually entered the true sanctuary of heaven that is not of human making ( Hb 9:11 ) . His place there is permanent , and his offering is his own blood that won eternal redemption ( Hb 9:12 ) . If the sacrifice of animals could bestow legal purification ( Hb 9:13 ) , how much more effective is the blood of the sinless , divine Christ who spontaneously offered himself to purge the human race of sin and render it fit for the service of God ( Hb 9:14 ) . - 9:11 The good things that have come to be : the majority of later manuscripts here read “ the good things to come ” ; cf . Hb 10:1 . - 9:13 A heifer ’ s ashes : ashes from a red heifer that had been burned were mixed with water and used for the cleansing of those who had become ritually defiled by touching a corpse ; see Nm 19:9 , 14–21 . - 9:14 Through the eternal spirit : this expression does not refer either to the holy Spirit or to the divine nature of Jesus but to the life of the risen Christ , “ a life that can not be destroyed ” ( Hb 7:16 ) . - 9:15–22 Jesus ’ role as mediator of the new covenant is based upon his sacrificial death ( cf . Hb 8:6 ) . His death has effected deliverance from transgressions , i.e. , deliverance from sins committed under the old covenant , which the Mosaic sacrifices were incapable of effacing . Until this happened , the eternal inheritance promised by God could not be obtained ( Hb 9:15 ) . This effect of his work follows the human pattern by which a last will and testament becomes effective only with the death of the testator ( Hb 9:16–17 ) . The Mosaic covenant was also associated with death , for Moses made use of blood to seal the pact between God and the people ( Hb 9:18–21 ) . In Old Testament tradition , guilt could normally not be remitted without the use of blood ( Hb 9:22 ; cf . Lv 17:11 ) . - 9:16–17 A will…death of the testator : the same Greek word diathēkē , meaning “ covenant ” in Hb 9:15 ,
NABRE	Hebrews	9	2	For a tabernacle was constructed , the outer one , [ b ] in which were the lampstand , the table , and the bread of offering ; this is called the Holy Place . ( A )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	3	[ c ] Behind the second veil was the tabernacle called the Holy of Holies , ( B )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	4	in which were the gold altar of incense [ d ] and the ark of the covenant entirely covered with gold . In it were the gold jar containing the manna , the staff of Aaron that had sprouted , and the tablets of the covenant . ( C )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	5	[ e ] Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of expiation . Now is not the time to speak of these in detail . ( D )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	6	With these arrangements for worship , the priests , in performing their service , [ f ] go into the outer tabernacle repeatedly , ( E )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	7	) . The description of the sanctuary and its furnishings is taken essentially from Ex 25–26 . This exclusion of the people from the Holy of Holies signified that they were not allowed to stand in God ’ s presence ( Hb 9:8 ) because their offerings and sacrifices , which were merely symbols of their need of spiritual renewal ( Hb 9:10 ) , could not obtain forgiveness of sins ( Hb 9:9 ) . - 9:2 The outer one : the author speaks of the outer tabernacle ( Hb 9:6 ) and the inner one ( Hb 9:7 ) rather than of one Mosaic tabernacle divided into two parts or sections . - 9:3 The second veil : what is meant is the veil that divided the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies . It is here called the second , because there was another veil at the entrance to the Holy Place , or “ outer tabernacle ” ( Ex 26:36 ) . - 9:4 The gold altar of incense : Ex 30:6 locates this altar in the Holy Place , i.e. , the first tabernacle , rather than in the Holy of Holies . Neither is there any Old Testament support for the assertion that the jar of manna and the staff of Aaron were in the ark of the covenant . For the tablets of the covenant , see Ex 25:16 . - 9:5 The place of expiation : the gold “ mercy seat ” ( Greek hilastērion , as in Rom 3:25 ) , where the blood of the sacrificial animals was sprinkled on the Day of Atonement ( Lv 16:14–15 ) . This rite achieved “ expiation ” or atonement for the sins of the preceding year . - 9:6 In performing their service : the priestly services that had to be performed regularly in the Holy Place or outer tabernacle included burning incense on the incense altar twice each day ( Ex 30:7 ) , replacing the loaves on the table of the bread of offering once each week ( Lv 24:8 ) , and constantly caring for the lamps on the lampstand ( Ex 27:21 ) . - 9:7 Not without blood : blood was essential to Old Testament sacrifice because it was believed that life was located in the blood . Hence blood was especially sacred , and its outpouring functioned as a meaningful symbol of cleansing from sin and reconciliation with God . Unlike Hebrews , the Old Testament never says that the blood is “ offered. ” The author is perhaps retrojecting into his description of Mosaic ritual a concept that belongs to the New Testament antitype , as Paul does when he speaks of the Israelites ’ passage through the sea as a “ baptism ” (
NABRE	Hebrews	9	8	In this way the holy Spirit shows that the way into the sanctuary had not yet been revealed while the outer tabernacle still had its place .
NABRE	Hebrews	9	10	but only in matters of food and drink and various ritual washings : regulations concerning the flesh , imposed until the time of the new order . ( G ) Sacrifice of Jesus .
NABRE	Hebrews	9	11	[ i ] But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that have come to be , [ j ] passing through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made by hands , that is , not belonging to this creation , ( H )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	12	he entered once for all into the sanctuary , not with the blood of goats and calves but with his own blood , thus obtaining eternal redemption . ( I )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of goats and bulls and the sprinkling of a heifer ’ s ashes [ k ] can sanctify those who are defiled so that their flesh is cleansed , ( J )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	14	how much more will the blood of Christ , who through the eternal spirit [ l ] offered himself unblemished to God , cleanse our consciences from dead works to worship the living God . ( K )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	15	[ m ] For this reason he is mediator of a new covenant : since a death has taken place for deliverance from transgressions under the first covenant , those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance . ( L )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	16	[ n ] Now where there is a will , the death of the testator must be established .
NABRE	Hebrews	9	17	For a will takes effect only at death ; it has no force while the testator is alive .
NABRE	Hebrews	9	18	, is used here with the meaning will . The new covenant , unlike the old , is at the same time a will that requires the death of the testator . Jesus as eternal Son is the one who established the new covenant together with his Father , author of both covenants ; at the same time he is the testator whose death puts his will into effect . - 9:19–20 A number of details here are different from the description of this covenant rite in Ex 24:5–8 . Exodus mentions only calves ( “ young bulls , ” NAB ) , not goats ( but this addition in Hebrews is of doubtful authenticity ) , says nothing of the use of water and crimson wool and hyssop ( these features probably came from a different rite ; cf . Lv 14:3–7 ; Nm 19:6–18 ) , and describes Moses as splashing blood on the altar , whereas Hebrews says he sprinkled it on the book ( but both book and altar are meant to symbolize the agreement of God ) . The words of Moses are also slightly different from those in Exodus and are closer to the words of Jesus at the Last Supper in Mk 14:24 // Mt 26:28 . - 9:21 According to Exodus , the tabernacle did not yet exist at the time of the covenant rite . Moreover , nothing is said of sprinkling it with blood at its subsequent dedication ( Ex 40:9–11 ) . - 9:22 Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness : in fact , ancient Israel did envisage other means of obtaining forgiveness ; the Old Testament mentions contrition of heart ( Ps 51:17 ) , fasting ( Jl 2:12 ) , and almsgiving ( Sir 3:29 ) . The author is limiting his horizon to the sacrificial cult , which did always involve the shedding of blood for its expiatory and unitive value . - 9:23–28 Since the blood of animals became a cleansing symbol among Old Testament prefigurements , it was necessary that the realities foreshadowed be brought into being by a shedding of blood that was infinitely more effective by reason of its worth ( Hb 9:23 ) . Christ did not simply prefigure the heavenly realities ( Hb 9:24 ) by performing an annual sacrifice with a blood not his own ( Hb 9:25 ) ; he offered the single sacrifice of himself as the final annulment of sin ( Hb 9:26 ) . Just as death is the unrepeatable act that ends a person ’ s life , so Christ ’ s offering of himself for all is the unrepeatable sacrifice that has once for all achieved redemption ( Hb 9:27–28 ) . - 9:26 At the end of the ages : the use of expressions such as this shows that the author of Hebrews , despite his interest in the Platonic concept of an eternal world above superior to temporal reality here below , nevertheless still clings to the Jewish Christian eschatology with its sequence of “ the present age ” and “ the age to come. ” - 9:28 To take away the sins of many : the reference is to Is 53:12 . Since the Greek verb anapherō can mean both “ to take away ” and “ to bear , ” the author no doubt intended to play upon both senses : Jesus took away sin by bearing it himself . See the similar wordplay in Jn 1:29 . Many is used in the Semitic meaning of “ all ” in the inclusive sense , as in Mk 14:24 . To those who eagerly await him : Jesus will appear a second time at the parousia , as the high priest reappeared on the Day of Atonement , emerging from the Holy of Holies , which he had entered to take away sin . This dramatic scene is described in Sir 50:5–11 .

NABRE	Hebrews	9	19	[ o ] When every commandment had been proclaimed by Moses to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves [ and goats ] , together with water and crimson wool and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people , ( M )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	20	saying , “ This is ‘ the blood of the covenant which God has enjoined upon you. ’ ” ( N )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	21	In the same way , he sprinkled also the tabernacle [ p ] and all the vessels of worship with blood . ( O )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	22	[ q ] According to the law almost everything is purified by blood , ( P ) and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness .
NABRE	Hebrews	9	23	[ r ] Therefore , it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified by these rites , but the heavenly things themselves by better sacrifices than these . ( Q )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	24	For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by hands , a copy of the true one , but heaven itself , that he might now appear before God on our behalf . ( R )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	25	Not that he might offer himself repeatedly , as the high priest enters each year into the sanctuary with blood that is not his own ;
NABRE	Hebrews	9	26	if that were so , he would have had to suffer repeatedly from the foundation of the world . But now once for all he has appeared at the end of the ages [ s ] to take away sin by his sacrifice . ( S )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	27	Just as it is appointed that human beings die once , and after this the judgment , ( T )
NABRE	Hebrews	9	28	so also Christ , offered once to take away the sins of many , [ t ] will appear a second time , not to take away sin but to bring salvation to those who eagerly await him . ( U ) Footnotes - 9:1–10 The regulations for worship under the old covenant permitted all the priests to enter the Holy Place ( Hb 2:6 ) , but only the high priest to enter the Holy of Holies and then only once a year ( Hb 9:3–5 ,

NABRE	Hebrews	10	10	By this “ will , ” we have been consecrated through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all . ( G )

NABRE	Hebrews	10	4	for it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats take away sins . ( C )
NABRE	Hebrews	10	5	For this reason , when he came into the world , he said : [ c ] “ Sacrifice and offering you did not desire , ( D ) but a body you prepared for me ;
NABRE	Hebrews	10	6	holocausts and sin offerings you took no delight in .
NABRE	Hebrews	10	7	Then I said , ‘ As is written of me in the scroll , Behold , I come to do your will , O God. ’ ”
NABRE	Hebrews	10	8	First he says , “ Sacrifices and offerings , holocausts and sin offerings , [ d ] you neither desired nor delighted in. ” These are offered according to the law . ( E )
NABRE	Hebrews	10	9	Then he says , “ Behold , I come to do your will. ” He takes away the first to establish the second . ( F )
NABRE	Hebrews	10	11	[ e ] Every priest stands daily at his ministry , offering frequently those same sacrifices that can never take away sins . ( H )
NABRE	Hebrews	10	12	But this one offered one sacrifice for sins , and took his seat forever at the right hand of God ; ( I )
NABRE	Hebrews	10	13	[ f ] now he waits until his enemies are made his footstool .
NABRE	Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering he has made perfect forever those who are being consecrated . ( J )

Eph 5:14 ; Jn 9:11 ) , but see Hb 6:4 and the note there . - 10:37–38 In support of his argument , the author uses Hb 2:3–4 in a wording almost identical with the text of the Codex Alexandrinus of the Septuagint but with the first and second lines of Hb 10:4 inverted .

NABRE	Hebrews	10	39	We are not among those who draw back and perish , but among those who have faith and will possess life . Footnotes - 10:1–10 Christian faith now realizes that the Old Testament sacrifices did not effect the spiritual benefits to come but only prefigured them ( Hb 10:1 ) . For if the sacrifices had actually effected the forgiveness of sin , there would have been no reason for their constant repetition ( Hb 10:2 ) . They were rather a continual reminder of the people ’ s sins ( Hb 10:3 ) . It is not reasonable to suppose that human sins could be removed by the blood of animal sacrifices ( Hb 10:4 ) . Christ , therefore , is here shown to understand his mission in terms of Ps 40:6–8 , cited according to the Septuagint ( Hb 10:5–7 ) . Jesus acknowledged that the Old Testament sacrifices did not remit the sins of the people and so , perceiving the will of God , offered his own body for this purpose ( Hb 10:8–10 ) . - 10:1 A shadow of the good things to come : the term shadow was used in Hb 8:5 to signify the earthly counterpart of the Platonic heavenly reality . But here it means a prefiguration of what is to come in Christ , as it is used in the Pauline literature ; cf . Col 2:17 . - 10:5–7 A passage from Ps 40:7–9 is placed in the mouth of the Son at his incarnation . As usual , the author follows the Septuagint text . There is a notable difference in Hb 10:5 ( Ps 40:6 ) , where the Masoretic text reads “ ears you have dug for me ” ( “ ears open to obedience you gave me , ” NAB ) , but most Septuagint manuscripts have “ a body you prepared for me , ” a reading obviously more suited to the interpretation of Hebrews . - 10:8 Sacrifices and offerings , holocausts and sin offerings : these four terms taken from the preceding passage of Ps
NABRE	Hebrews	10	40	( with the first two changed to plural forms ) are probably intended as equivalents to the four principal types of Old Testament sacrifices : peace offerings ( Lv

NABRE	Hebrews	11	14	for those who speak thus show that they are seeking a homeland .
NABRE	Hebrews	11	15	If they had been thinking of the land from which they had come , they would have had opportunity to return .
NABRE	Hebrews	11	16	But now they desire a better homeland , a heavenly one . Therefore , God is not ashamed to be called their God , for he has prepared a city for them . ( M )
NABRE	Hebrews	11	17	By faith Abraham , when put to the test , offered up Isaac , and he who had received the promises was ready to offer his only son , ( N )
NABRE	Hebrews	11	18	of whom it was said , “ Through Isaac descendants shall bear your name. ” ( O )
NABRE	Hebrews	11	19	[ f ] He reasoned that God was able to raise even from the dead , ( P ) and he received Isaac back as a symbol .

NABRE	Hebrews	11	22	By faith Joseph , near the end of his life , spoke of the Exodus of the Israelites and gave instructions about his bones . ( S )

NABRE	Hebrews	11	24	[ h ] By faith Moses , when he had grown up , refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh ’ s daughter ; ( U )
NABRE	Hebrews	11	25	he chose to be ill-treated along with the people of God rather than enjoy the fleeting pleasure of sin .
NABRE	Hebrews	11	26	He considered the reproach of the Anointed greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt , for he was looking to the recompense .
NABRE	Hebrews	11	27	By faith he left Egypt , not fearing the king ’ s fury , for he persevered as if seeing the one who is invisible . ( V )
NABRE	Hebrews	11	28	By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood , that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them . ( W )
NABRE	Hebrews	11	29	By faith they crossed the Red Sea as if it were dry land , but when the Egyptians attempted it they were drowned . ( X )

NABRE	Hebrews	11	37	They were stoned , sawed in two , put to death at sword ’ s point ; they went about in skins of sheep or goats , needy , afflicted , tormented . ( AF )
NABRE	Hebrews	11	38	The world was not worthy of them . They wandered about in deserts and on mountains , in caves and in crevices in the earth . ( AG )
NABRE	Hebrews	11	39	Yet all these , though approved because of their faith , did not receive what had been promised .
NABRE	Hebrews	11	40	God had foreseen something better for us , so that without us they should not be made perfect . [ i ] Footnotes - 11:1–40 This chapter draws upon the people and events of the Old Testament to paint an inspiring portrait of religious faith , firm and unyielding in the face of any obstacles that confront it . These pages rank among the most eloquent and lofty to be found in the Bible . They expand the theme announced in Hb 6:12 , to which the author now returns ( Hb 10:39 ) . The material of this chapter is developed chronologically . Hb 11:3–7 draw upon the first nine chapters of Genesis ( Gn 1–9 ) ; Hb 11:8–22 , upon the period of the patriarchs ; Hb 11:23–31 , upon the time of Moses ; Hb 11:32–38 , upon the history of the judges , the prophets , and the Maccabean martyrs . The author gives the most extensive description of faith provided in the New Testament , though his interest does not lie in a technical , theological definition . In view of the needs of his audience he describes what authentic faith does , not what it is in itself . Through faith God guarantees the blessings to be hoped for from him , providing evidence in the gift of faith that what he promises will eventually come to pass ( Hb 11:1 ) . Because they accepted in faith God ’ s guarantee of the future , the biblical personages discussed in Hb 11:3–38 were themselves commended by God ( Hb 11:2 ) . Christians have even greater reason to remain firm in faith since they , unlike the Old Testament men and women of faith , have perceived the beginning of God ’ s fulfillment of his messianic promises ( Hb 11:39–40 ) . - 11:1 Faith is the realization…evidence : the author is not attempting a precise definition . There is dispute about the meaning of the Greek words hypostasis and elenchos , here translated realization and evidence , respectively . Hypostasis usually means “ substance , ” “ being ” ( as translated in Hb 1:3 ) , or “ reality ” ( as translated in Hb 3:14 ) ; here it connotes something more subjective , and so realization has been chosen rather than “ assurance ” ( RSV ) . Elenchos , usually “ proof , ” is used here in an objective sense and so translated evidence rather than the transferred sense of “ ( inner ) conviction ” ( RSV ) . - 11:3 By faith…God : this verse does not speak of the faith of the Old Testament men and women but is in the first person plural . Hence it seems out of place in the sequence of thought . - 11:4 The “ Praise of the Ancestors ” in Sir 44:1–50:21 gives a similar list of heroes . The Cain and Abel narrative in Gn 4:1–16 does not mention Abel ’ s faith . It says , however , that God “ looked with favor on Abel and his offering ” ( Gn 4:4 ) ; in view of Hb 11:6 the author probably understood God ’ s favor to have been activated by Abel ’ s faith . Though dead , he still speaks : possibly because his blood “ cries out to me from the soil ” ( Gn 4:10 ) , but more probably a way of saying that the repeated story of Abel provides ongoing witness to faith . - 11:6 One must believe not only that God exists but that he is concerned about human conduct ; the Old Testament defines folly as the denial of this truth ; cf . Ps 52:2 . - 11:19 As a symbol : Isaac ’ s “ return from death ” is seen as a symbol of Christ ’ s resurrection . Others understand the words en parabolē to mean “ in figure , ” i.e. , the word dead is used figuratively of Isaac , since he did not really die . But in the one other place that parabolē occurs in Hebrews , it means symbol ( Hb 9:9 ) . - 11:20–22 Each of these three patriarchs , Isaac , Jacob , and Joseph , had faith in the future fulfillment of God ’ s promise and renewed this faith when near death . - 11:24–27 The reason given for Moses ’ departure from Egypt differs from the account in Ex 2:11–15 . The author also gives a christological interpretation of his decision to share the trials of his people . - 11:40 So that without us they should not be made perfect : the heroes of the Old Testament obtained their recompense only after the saving work of Christ had been accomplished . Thus they already enjoy what Christians who are still struggling do not yet possess in its fullness .

NABRE	Hebrews	12	12	So strengthen your drooping hands and your weak knees . ( F )
NABRE	Hebrews	12	1	Therefore , since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses , let us rid ourselves of every burden and sin that clings to us [ b ] and persevere in running the race that lies before us
NABRE	Hebrews	12	2	while keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus , the leader and perfecter of faith . For the sake of the joy that lay before him he endured the cross , despising its shame , and has taken his seat at the right of the throne of God . ( A )
NABRE	Hebrews	12	3	Consider how he endured such opposition from sinners , in order that you may not grow weary and lose heart .
NABRE	Hebrews	12	4	In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood .
NABRE	Hebrews	12	5	You have also forgotten the exhortation addressed to you as sons : “ My son , do not disdain the discipline of the Lord ( B ) or lose heart when reproved by him ;
NABRE	Hebrews	12	6	for whom the Lord loves , he disciplines ; he scourges every son he acknowledges. ”
NABRE	Hebrews	12	7	Endure your trials as “ discipline ” ; God treats you as sons . For what “ son ” is there whom his father does not discipline ? ( C )
NABRE	Hebrews	12	8	If you are without discipline , in which all have shared , you are not sons but bastards .
NABRE	Hebrews	12	9	Besides this , we have had our earthly fathers to discipline us , and we respected them . Should we not [ then ] submit all the more to the Father of spirits and live ? ( D )

Abel ’ s blood cried out from the earth for vengeance , but the blood of Jesus has opened the way for everyone , providing cleansing and access to God ( Hb 10:19 ) .

NABRE	Hebrews	12	15	[ c ] See to it that no one be deprived of the grace of God , that no bitter root spring up and cause trouble , through which many may become defiled , ( I )
NABRE	Hebrews	12	16	that no one be an immoral or profane person like Esau , who sold his birthright for a single meal . ( J )
NABRE	Hebrews	12	17	For you know that later , when he wanted to inherit his father ’ s blessing , he was rejected because he found no opportunity to change his mind , even though he sought the blessing with tears . ( K )
NABRE	Hebrews	12	18	[ d ] You have not approached that which could be touched [ e ] ( L ) and a blazing fire and gloomy darkness and storm
NABRE	Hebrews	12	19	and a trumpet blast and a voice speaking words such that those who heard begged that no message be further addressed to them , ( M )
NABRE	Hebrews	12	20	for they could not bear to hear the command : “ If even an animal touches the mountain , it shall be stoned. ” ( N )
NABRE	Hebrews	12	21	Indeed , so fearful was the spectacle that Moses said , “ I am terrified and trembling. ” ( O )

NABRE	Hebrews	12	23	and the assembly of the firstborn enrolled in heaven , [ f ] and God the judge of all , and the spirits of the just made perfect , ( Q )
NABRE	Hebrews	12	24	and Jesus , the mediator of a new covenant , and the sprinkled blood that speaks more eloquently [ g ] than that of Abel . ( R )
NABRE	Hebrews	12	25	See that you do not reject the one who speaks . For if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth , how much more in our case if we turn away from the one who warns from heaven . ( S )
NABRE	Hebrews	12	26	His voice shook the earth at that time , but now he has promised , “ I will once more shake not only earth but heaven. ” ( T )
NABRE	Hebrews	12	27	That phrase , “ once more , ” points to [ the ] removal of shaken , created things , so that what is unshaken may remain . ( U )
NABRE	Hebrews	12	28	Therefore , we who are receiving the unshakable kingdom should have gratitude , with which we should offer worship pleasing to God in reverence and awe . ( V )
NABRE	Hebrews	12	29	For our God is a consuming fire . ( W ) Footnotes - 12:1–13 Christian life is to be inspired not only by the Old Testament men and women of faith ( Hb 12:1 ) but above all by Jesus . As the architect of Christian faith , he had himself to endure the cross before receiving the glory of his triumph ( Hb 12:2 ) . Reflection on his sufferings should give his followers courage to continue the struggle , if necessary even to the shedding of blood ( Hb 12:3–4 ) . Christians should regard their own sufferings as the affectionate correction of the Lord , who loves them as a father loves his children . - 12:1 That clings to us : the meaning is uncertain , since the Greek word euperistatos , translated cling , occurs only here . The papyrus P46 and one minuscule read euperispastos , “ easily distracting , ” which also makes good sense . - 12:15–17 Esau serves as an example in two ways : his profane attitude illustrates the danger of apostasy , and his inability to secure a blessing afterward illustrates the impossibility of repenting after falling away ( see Hb 6:4–6 ) . - 12:18–29 As a final appeal for adherence to Christian teaching , the two covenants , of Moses and of Christ , are compared . The Mosaic covenant , the author argues , is shown to have originated in fear of God and threats of divine punishment ( Hb 12:18–21 ) . The covenant in Christ gives us direct access to God ( Hb 12:22 ) , makes us members of the Christian community , God ’ s children , a sanctified people ( Hb 12:23 ) , who have Jesus as mediator to speak for us ( Hb 12:24 ) . Not to heed the voice of the risen Christ is a graver sin than the rejection of the word of Moses ( Hb 12:25–26 ) . Though Christians fall away , God ’ s kingdom in Christ will remain and his justice will punish those guilty of deserting it ( Hb 12:28–29 ) . - 12:18 This remarkably beautiful passage contrasts two great assemblies of people : that of the Israelites gathered at Mount Sinai for the sealing of the old covenant and the promulgation of the Mosaic law , and that of the followers of Jesus gathered at Mount Zion , the heavenly Jerusalem , the assembly of the new covenant . This latter scene , marked by the presence of countless angels and of Jesus with his redeeming blood , is reminiscent of the celestial liturgies of the Book of Revelation . - 12:23 The assembly of the firstborn enrolled in heaven : this expression may refer to the angels of Hb 12:22 , or to the heroes of the Old Testament ( see Hb

NABRE	Hebrews	13	22	Brothers , I ask you to bear with this message of encouragement , for I have written to you rather briefly .
NABRE	Hebrews	13	23	I must let you know that our brother Timothy has been set free . If he comes soon , I shall see you together with him . ( N )
NABRE	Hebrews	13	24	Greetings to all your leaders and to all the holy ones . Those from Italy send you greetings .
NABRE	Hebrews	13	25	Grace be with all of you . ( O ) Footnotes - 13:1–16 After recommendations on social and moral matters ( Hb 13:1–6 ) , the letter turns to doctrinal issues . The fact that the original leaders are dead should not cause the recipients of this letter to lose their faith ( Hb 13:7 ) , for Christ still lives and he remains always the same ( Hb 13:8 ) . They must not rely for their personal sanctification on regulations concerning foods ( Hb 13:9 ) , nor should they entertain the notion that Judaism and Christianity can be intermingled ( Hb 13:10 ; cf . notes on Gal 2:11–14 ; 2:15–21 ) . As Jesus died separated from his own people , so must the Christian community remain apart from the religious doctrines of Judaism ( Hb 13:11–14 ) . Christ must be the heart and center of the community ( Hb 13:15–16 ) . - 13:9 Strange teaching : this doctrine about foods probably refers to the Jewish food laws ; in view of Hb 13:10 , however , the author may be thinking of the Mosaic sacrificial banquets . - 13:10 We have an altar : this does not refer to the Eucharist , which is never clearly mentioned in Hebrews , but to the sacrifice of Christ . - 13:17–25 Recommending obedience to the leaders of the community , the author asks for prayers ( Hb 13:17–19 ) . The letter concludes with a blessing ( Hb 13:20–21 ) , a final request for the acceptance of its message ( Hb 13:22 ) , information regarding Timothy ( Hb 13:23 ) , and general greetings ( Hb 13:24–25 ) . - 13:20–21 These verses constitute one of the most beautiful blessings in the New Testament . The resurrection of Jesus is presupposed throughout Hebrews , since it is included in the author ’ s frequently expressed idea of his exaltation , but this is the only place where it is explicitly mentioned .

NABRE	James	1	2	( B ) Consider it all joy , my brothers , when you encounter various trials , [ b ]
NABRE	James	1	3	for you know that the testing [ c ] of your faith produces perseverance .

NABRE	James	1	22	Be doers of the word and not hearers only , deluding yourselves . ( M )

NABRE	James	2	1	Cor 1:27–29 ) . Divine favor rather consists in God ’ s election and promises ( Jas 2:5 ) . The rich who oppress the poor blaspheme the name of Christ ( Jas 2:6–7 ) . By violating one law of love of neighbor , they offend against the whole law ( Jas 2:8–11 ) . On the other hand , conscious awareness of the final judgment helps the faithful to fulfill the whole law ( Jas 2:12 ) . - 2:4 When Christians show favoritism to the rich they are guilty of the worst kind of prejudice and discrimination . The author says that such Christians set themselves up as judges who judge not by divine law but by the basest , self-serving motives . - 2:5 The poor , “ God ’ s poor ” of the Old Testament , were seen by Jesus as particularly open to God for belief in and reliance on him alone ( Lk 6:20 ) . God ’ s law can not tolerate their oppression in any way ( Jas 2:9 ) . - 2:8 Royal : literally , “ kingly ” ; because the Mosaic law came from God , the universal king . There may be an allusion to Jesus ’ uses of this commandment in his preaching of the kingdom of God ( Mt 22:39 ; Mk 12:31 ; Lk 10:27 ) . - 2:12–13 The law upon which the last judgment will be based is the law of freedom . As Jesus taught , mercy ( which participates in God ’ s own loving mercy ) includes forgiveness of those who wrong us ( see Mt 6:12 , 14–15 ) . - 2:14–26 The theme of these verses is the relationship of faith and works ( deeds ) . It has been argued that the teaching here contradicts that of Paul ( see especially Rom 4:5–6 ) . The problem can only be understood if the different viewpoints of the two authors are seen . Paul argues against those who claim to participate in God ’ s salvation because of their good deeds as well as because they have committed themselves to trust in God through Jesus Christ ( Paul ’ s concept of faith ) . Paul certainly understands , however , the implications of true faith for a life of love and generosity ( see Gal 5:6 , 13–15 ) . The author of James is well aware that proper conduct can only come about with an authentic commitment to God in faith ( Jas 2:18 ,
NABRE	James	2	3	and you pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say , “ Sit here , please , ” while you say to the poor one , “ Stand there , ” or “ Sit at my feet , ”
NABRE	James	2	4	have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil designs ? [ b ]
NABRE	James	2	5	Listen , my beloved brothers . Did not God choose those who are poor [ c ] in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those who love him ? ( A )
NABRE	James	2	6	But you dishonored the poor person . Are not the rich oppressing you ? And do they themselves not haul you off to court ?
NABRE	James	2	7	Is it not they who blaspheme the noble name that was invoked over you ? ( B )
NABRE	James	2	8	However , if you fulfill the royal [ d ] law according to the scripture , “ You shall love your neighbor as yourself , ” you are doing well . ( C )
NABRE	James	2	9	But if you show partiality , you commit sin , and are convicted by the law as transgressors . ( D )
NABRE	James	2	10	For whoever keeps the whole law , but falls short in one particular , has become guilty in respect to all of it . ( E )
NABRE	James	2	11	For he who said , “ You shall not commit adultery , ” also said , “ You shall not kill. ” ( F ) Even if you do not commit adultery but kill , you have become a transgressor of the law .
NABRE	James	2	12	( G ) So speak and so act as people who will be judged by the law of freedom . [ e ]
NABRE	James	2	13	For the judgment is merciless to one who has not shown mercy ; mercy triumphs over judgment . ( H ) Faith and Works . [ f ]
NABRE	James	2	14	What good is it , my brothers , if someone says he has faith but does not have works ? Can that faith save him ? ( I )
NABRE	James	2	15	If a brother or sister has nothing to wear and has no food for the day ,
NABRE	James	2	16	and one of you says to them , “ Go in peace , keep warm , and eat well , ” but you do not give them the necessities of the body , what good is it ? ( J )
NABRE	James	2	17	So also faith of itself , if it does not have works , is dead .
NABRE	James	2	18	Indeed someone may say , “ You have faith and I have works. ” Demonstrate your faith to me without works , and I will demonstrate my faith to you from my works .
NABRE	James	2	19	You believe that God is one . You do well . Even the demons believe that and tremble .
NABRE	James	2	20	Do you want proof , you ignoramus , that faith without works is useless ?
NABRE	James	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar ? ( K )
NABRE	James	2	22	You see that faith was active along with his works , and faith was completed by the works .
NABRE	James	2	23	Thus the scripture was fulfilled that says , “ Abraham believed God , and it was credited to him as righteousness , ” and he was called “ the friend of God. ” ( L )
NABRE	James	2	24	See how a person is justified by works and not by faith alone .
NABRE	James	2	25	And in the same way , was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by a different route ? ( M )

NABRE	James	3	4	It is the same with ships : even though they are so large and driven by fierce winds , they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot ’ s inclination wishes .
NABRE	James	3	5	In the same way the tongue is a small member and yet has great pretensions . Consider how small a fire can set a huge forest ablaze .
NABRE	James	3	6	The tongue is also a fire . It exists among our members as a world of malice , defiling the whole body and setting the entire course of our lives on fire , itself set on fire by Gehenna .
NABRE	James	3	7	For every kind of beast and bird , of reptile and sea creature , can be tamed and has been tamed by the human species ,
NABRE	James	3	8	but no human being can tame the tongue . It is a restless evil , full of deadly poison . ( B )
NABRE	James	3	9	With it we bless the Lord and Father , and with it we curse human beings who are made in the likeness of God .
NABRE	James	3	10	From the same mouth come blessing and cursing . This need not be so , my brothers .
NABRE	James	3	11	Does a spring gush forth from the same opening both pure and brackish water ?

NABRE	James	3	14	But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts , do not boast and be false to the truth .
NABRE	James	3	15	Wisdom of this kind does not come down from above but is earthly , unspiritual , demonic .
NABRE	James	3	16	For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist , there is disorder and every foul practice .
NABRE	James	3	17	But the wisdom from above is first of all pure , then peaceable , gentle , compliant , full of mercy and good fruits , without inconstancy or insincerity . ( E )

( F ) Footnotes - 3:1–12 The use and abuse of the important role of teaching in the church ( Jas 3:1 ) are here related to the good and bad use of the tongue ( Jas 3:9–12 ) , the instrument through which teaching was chiefly conveyed ( see Sir 5:11–6:1 ; 28:12–26 ) . - 3:13–18 This discussion of true wisdom is related to the previous reflection on the role of the teacher as one who is in control of his speech . The qualities of the wise man endowed from above are detailed ( Jas 3:17–18 ; cf . Gal 5:22–23 ) , in contrast to the qualities of earthbound wisdom ( Jas 3:14–16 ; cf .

NABRE	James	4	4	Adulterers ! [ c ] Do you not know that to be a lover of the world means enmity with God ? Therefore , whoever wants to be a lover of the world makes himself an enemy of God . ( B )
NABRE	James	4	1	Where do the wars and where do the conflicts among you come from ? Is it not from your passions [ b ] that make war within your members ? ( A )
NABRE	James	4	2	You covet but do not possess . You kill and envy but you can not obtain ; you fight and wage war . You do not possess because you do not ask .
NABRE	James	4	3	You ask but do not receive , because you ask wrongly , to spend it on your passions .
NABRE	James	4	5	Or do you suppose that the scripture speaks without meaning when it says , “ The spirit that he has made to dwell in us tends toward jealousy ” ? [ d ]
NABRE	James	4	6	But he bestows a greater grace ; therefore , it says : ( C ) “ God resists the proud , but gives grace to the humble. ” [ e ]
NABRE	James	4	7	So submit yourselves to God . Resist the devil , and he will flee from you . ( D )
NABRE	James	4	8	Draw near to God , and he will draw near to you . Cleanse your hands , you sinners , and purify your hearts , you of two minds . ( E )
NABRE	James	4	9	Begin to lament , to mourn , to weep . Let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection .
NABRE	James	4	10	Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you . ( F )
NABRE	James	4	11	Do not speak evil of one another , brothers . Whoever speaks evil of a brother or judges his brother speaks evil of the law and judges the law . [ f ] If you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law but a judge .
NABRE	James	4	12	There is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save or to destroy . Who then are you to judge your neighbor ? ( G ) Warning Against Presumption . [ g ]
NABRE	James	4	13	Come now , you who say , “ Today or tomorrow we shall go into such and such a town , spend a year there doing business , and make a profit ” —
NABRE	James	4	14	you have no idea what your life will be like tomorrow . [ h ] You are a puff of smoke that appears briefly and then disappears . ( H )
NABRE	James	4	15	Instead you should say , “ If the Lord wills it , [ i ] we shall live to do this or that. ”
NABRE	James	4	16	But now you are boasting in your arrogance . All such boasting is evil .
NABRE	James	4	17	( I ) So for one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it , it is a sin . [ j ] Footnotes - 4:1–12 The concern here is with the origin of conflicts in the Christian community . These are occasioned by love of the world , which means enmity with God ( Jas 4:4 ) . Further , the conflicts are bound up with failure to pray properly ( cf . Mt 7:7–11 ; Jn 14:13 ; 15:7 ; 16:23 ) , that is , not asking God at all or using God ’ s kindness only for one ’ s pleasure ( Jas 4:2–3 ) . In contrast , the proper dispositions are submission to God , repentance , humility , and resistance to evil ( Jas 4:7–10 ) . - 4:1–3 Passions : the Greek word here ( literally , “ pleasures ” ) does not indicate that pleasure is evil . Rather , as the text points out ( Jas 4:2–3 ) , it is the manner in which one deals with needs and desires that determines good or bad . The motivation for any action can be wrong , especially if one does not pray properly but seeks only selfish enjoyment ( Jas 4:3 ) . - 4:4 Adulterers : a common biblical image for the covenant between God and his people is the marriage bond . In this image , breaking the covenant with God is likened to the unfaithfulness of adultery . - 4:5 The meaning of this saying is difficult because the author of James cites , probably from memory , a passage that is not in any extant manuscript of the Bible . Other translations of the text with a completely different meaning are possible : “ The Spirit that he ( God ) made to dwell in us yearns ( for us ) jealously , ” or , “ He ( God ) yearns jealously for the spirit that he has made to dwell in us. ” If this last translation is correct , the author perhaps had in mind an apocryphal religious text that echoes the idea that God is zealous for his creatures ; cf . Ex 20:5 ; Dt 4:24 ; Zec 8:2 . - 4:6 The point of this whole argument is that God wants the happiness of all , but that selfishness and pride can make that impossible . We must work with him in humility ( Jas 4:10 ) . - 4:11 Slander of a fellow Christian does not break just one commandment but makes mockery of the authority of law in general and therefore of God . - 4:13–17 The uncertainty of life ( Jas 4:14 ) , its complete dependence on God , and the necessity of submitting to God ’ s will ( Jas 4:15 ) all help one know and do what is right ( Jas 4:17 ) . To disregard this is to live in pride and arrogance ( Jas 4:16 ) ; failure to do what is right is a sin ( Jas 4:17 ) . - 4:14 Some important Greek manuscripts here have , “ You who have no idea what tomorrow will bring . Why , what is your life ? ” - 4:15 If the Lord wills it : often in piety referred to as the “ conditio Jacobaea , ” the condition James says we should employ to qualify all our plans . - 4:17 It is a sin : those who live arrogantly , forgetting the contingency of life and our dependence on God ( Jas 4:13–16 ) , are guilty of sin .

Virtue and sin distinguish the children of God from the children of the devil . - 3:9 A habitual sinner is a child of the devil , while a child of God , who by definition is in fellowship with God , can not sin .

Rev 1:18 ; Dn 7:9 . His eyes were like a fiery flame : Christ is portrayed as all-knowing ; cf . Rev 2:23 ; Ps 7:10 ; Jer 17:10 ; and similar expressions in Rev 2:18 ; 19:12 ; cf . Dn 10:6 . - 1:15 His feet…furnace : Christ is depicted as unchangeable ; cf . Ez 1:27 ; Dn 10:6 . The Greek word translated “ refined ” is unconnected grammatically with any other word in the sentence . His voice…water : Christ speaks with divine authority ; cf . Ez 1:24 . - 1:16 Seven stars : in the pagan world , Mithras and the Caesars were represented with seven stars in their right hand , symbolizing their universal dominion . A sharp two-edged sword : this refers to the word of God ( cf . Eph 6:17 ; Hb 4:12 ) that will destroy unrepentant sinners ; cf . Rev 2:16 ; 19:15 ; Wis 18:15 ; Is 11:4 ; 49:2 . His face…brightest : this symbolizes the divine majesty of Christ ; cf . Rev 10:1 ; 21:23 ; Jgs 5:31 ; Is 60:19 ; Mt 17:2 . - 1:17 It was an Old Testament belief that for sinful human beings to see God was to die ; cf . Ex 19:21 ; 33:20 ; Jgs 6:22–23 ; Is 6:5 . - 1:18 Netherworld : Greek Hades , Hebrew Sheol , the abode of the dead ; cf . Rev 20:13–14 ; Nm 16:33 . - 1:19 What you have seen , and what is happening , and what will happen afterwards : the three parts of the Book of Revelation , the vision ( Rev 1:10–20 ) , the situation in the seven churches ( Rev 2–3 ) , and the events of Rev 6–22 . - 1:20 Secret meaning : literally , “ mystery. ” Angels : these are the presiding spirits of the seven churches . Angels were thought to be in charge of the physical world ( cf . Rev 7:1 ; 14:18 ; 16:5 ) and of nations ( Dn 10:13 ; 12:1 ) , communities ( the seven churches ) , and individuals ( Mt 18:10 ; Acts 12:15 ) . Some have seen in the “ angel ” of each of the seven churches its pastor or a personification of the spirit of the congregation .

NABRE	Revelation	1	20	. - 1:4–8 Although Revelation begins and ends ( Rev 22:21 ) with Christian epistolary formulae , there is nothing between Rev
NABRE	Revelation	1	22	resembling a letter . The author here employs the standard word order for greetings in Greek letter writing : “ N . to N. , greetings… ” ; see note on Rom 1:1 . - 1:4 Seven churches in Asia : Asia refers to the Roman province of that name in western Asia Minor ( modern Turkey ) ; these representative churches are mentioned by name in Rev 1:11 , and each is the recipient of a message ( Rev 2:1–3:22 ) . Seven is the biblical number suggesting fullness and completeness ; thus the seer is writing for the whole church . - 1:5 Freed us : the majority of Greek manuscripts and several early versions read “ washed us ” ; but “ freed us ” is supported by the best manuscripts and fits well with Old Testament imagery , e.g. , Is 40:2 . - 1:8 The Alpha and the Omega : the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet . In Rev 22:13 the same words occur together with the expressions “ the First and the Last , the Beginning and the End ” ; cf . Rev 1:17 ; 2:8 ; 21:6 ; Is 41:4 ; 44:6 . - 1:9–20 In this first vision , the seer is commanded to write what he sees to the seven churches ( Rev 1:9–11 ) . He sees Christ in glory , whom he depicts in stock apocalyptic imagery ( Rev 1:12–16 ) , and hears him describe himself in terms meant to encourage Christians by emphasizing his victory over death ( Rev 1:17–20 ) . - 1:9 Island called Patmos : one of the Sporades islands in the Aegean Sea , some fifty miles south of Ephesus , used by the Romans as a penal colony . Because I proclaimed God ’ s word : literally , “ on account of God ’ s word. ” - 1:10 The Lord ’ s day : Sunday . As loud as a trumpet : the imagery is derived from the theophany at Sinai ( Ex 19:16 ,

Ps 2:8–9 ) and resurrection victory over death , symbolized by the morning star ; cf .

NABRE	Revelation	2	3	Moreover , you have endurance and have suffered for my name , and you have not grown weary .
NABRE	Revelation	2	4	Yet I hold this against you : you have lost the love you had at first .
NABRE	Revelation	2	5	Realize how far you have fallen . Repent , and do the works you did at first . Otherwise , I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place , unless you repent .
NABRE	Revelation	2	6	But you have this in your favor : you hate the works of the Nicolaitans , [ e ] which I also hate .

NABRE	Revelation	2	10	Do not be afraid of anything that you are going to suffer . Indeed , the devil will throw some of you into prison , that you may be tested , and you will face an ordeal for ten days . Remain faithful until death , and I will give you the crown of life .
NABRE	Revelation	2	11	) , the Nicolaitans in Pergamum and Ephesus ( Rev 2:6 ) accommodated their Christian faith to paganism . They abused the principle of liberty enunciated by Paul (

NABRE	Revelation	2	13	. - 2:11 The second death : this refers to the eternal death , when sinners will receive their final punishment ; cf . Rev 20:6 , 14–15 ; 21:8 . - 2:12–17 The letter to Pergamum praises the members of the church for persevering in their faith in Christ even in the midst of a pagan setting and in face of persecution and martyrdom ( Rev 2:13 ) . But it admonishes them about members who advocate an unprincipled morality ( Rev 2:14 ; cf .
NABRE	Revelation	2	14	,
NABRE	Revelation	2	15	Likewise , you also have some people who hold to the teaching of [ the ] Nicolaitans .

NABRE	Revelation	2	17	“ ‘ “ Whoever has ears ought to hear what the Spirit says to the churches .

NABRE	Revelation	2	18	“ To the angel of the church in Thyatira , [ q ] write this : “ ‘ The Son of God , whose eyes are like a fiery flame and whose feet are like polished brass , says this :
NABRE	Revelation	2	19	; 17:5 ,
NABRE	Revelation	2	20	Yet I hold this against you , that you tolerate the woman Jezebel , who calls herself a prophetess , who teaches and misleads my servants to play the harlot and to eat food sacrificed to idols . [ r ]
NABRE	Revelation	2	21	I have given her time to repent , but she refuses to repent of her harlotry .
NABRE	Revelation	2	22	So I will cast her on a sickbed and plunge those who commit adultery with her into intense suffering unless they repent of her works .
NABRE	Revelation	2	23	I will also put her children [ s ] to death . Thus shall all the churches come to know that I am the searcher of hearts and minds and that I will give each of you what your works deserve . ( F )
NABRE	Revelation	2	24	But I say to the rest of you in Thyatira , who do not uphold this teaching and know nothing of the so-called deep secrets of Satan : [ t ] on you I will place no further burden ,

NABRE	Revelation	2	28	just as I received authority from my Father . And to him I will give the morning star .
NABRE	Revelation	2	29	“ ‘ “ Whoever has ears ought to hear what the Spirit says to the churches. ” ’ Footnotes - 2:1–3:22 Each of the seven letters follows the same pattern : address ; description of the exalted Christ ; blame and/or praise for the church addressed ; threat and/or admonition ; final exhortation and promise to all Christians . - 2:1–7 The letter to Ephesus praises the members of the church there for their works and virtues , including discerning false teachers ( Rev 2:2–3 ) , but admonishes them to repent and return to their former devotion ( Rev 2:4–5 ) . It concludes with a reference to the Nicolaitans ( see note on Rev 2:6 ) and a promise that the victor will have access to eternal life ( Rev 2:7 ) . - 2:1 Ephesus : this great ancient city had a population of ca . 250,000 ; it was the capital of the Roman province of Asia and the commercial , cultural , and religious center of Asia . The other six churches were located in the same province , situated roughly in a circle ; they were selected for geographical reasons rather than for the size of their Christian communities . Walks in the midst of the seven gold lampstands : this signifies that Christ is always present in the church ; see note on Rev 1:4 . - 2:2 Who call themselves…impostors : this refers to unauthorized and perverse missionaries ; cf . Acts 20:29–30 . - 2:6 Nicolaitans : these are perhaps the impostors of Rev 2:2 ; see note on Rev 2:14–15 . There is little evidence for connecting this group with Nicolaus , the proselyte from Antioch , mentioned in Acts 6:5 . - 2:7 Victor : referring to any Christian individual who holds fast to the faith and does God ’ s will in the face of persecution . The tree of life that is in the garden of God : this is a reference to the tree in the primeval paradise ( Gn 2:9 ) ; cf . Rev 22:2 ,

NABRE	Revelation	3	1	Cor 16:9 ;
NABRE	Revelation	3	2	Cor 1:20 . Source of God ’ s creation : literally , “ the beginning of God ’ s creation , ” a concept found also in Jn 1:3 ; Col 1:16–17 ; Hb 1:2 ; cf . Prv 8:22–31 ; Wis 9:1–2 . - 3:15–16 Halfhearted commitment to the faith is nauseating to Christ ; cf . Rom 12:11 . - 3:16 Spit : literally , “ vomit. ” The image is that of a beverage that should be either hot or cold . Perhaps there is an allusion to the hot springs of Hierapolis across the Lycus river from Laodicea , which would have been lukewarm by the time they reached Laodicea . - 3:17 Economic prosperity occasioned spiritual bankruptcy . - 3:18 Gold…fire : God ’ s grace . White garments : symbol of an upright life ; the city was noted for its violet/purple cloth . Ointment…eyes : to remove spiritual blindness ; one of the city ’ s exports was eye ointment ( see note on Rev 3:14 ) . - 3:20 Christ invites all to the messianic banquet in heaven ; cf . Is 25:6 ; Lk 14:15 ; 22:30 . Scripture texts , prefaces , introductions , footnotes and cross references used in this work are taken from the New American Bible , revised edition ©

NABRE	Revelation	3	6	“ ‘ “ Whoever has ears ought to hear what the Spirit says to the churches. ” ’ To Philadelphia . [ d ]
NABRE	Revelation	3	7	. New Jerusalem : it is described in Rev 21:10–22:5 . - 3:14–22 The letter to Laodicea reprimands the community for being lukewarm ( Rev 3:15–16 ) , but no particular faults are singled out . Their material prosperity is contrasted with their spiritual poverty , the violet tunics that were the source of their wealth with the white robe of baptism , and their famous eye ointment with true spiritual perception ( Rev 3:17–18 ) . But Christ ’ s chastisement is inspired by love and a desire to be allowed to share the messianic banquet with his followers in the heavenly kingdom ( Rev 3:19–21 ) . - 3:14 Laodicea : ca . forty miles southeast of Philadelphia and ca . eighty miles east of Ephesus , a wealthy industrial and commercial center , with a renowned medical school . It exported fine woolen garments and was famous for its eye salves . It was so wealthy that it was proudly rebuilt without outside aid after the devastating earthquake of A.D. 60/61 . The Amen : this is a divine title ( cf . Hebrew text of Is 65:16 ) applied to Christ ; cf .
NABRE	Revelation	3	8	, always refers to the pagan world . - 3:12 Pillar : this may be an allusion to the rebuilding of the city ; see note on v

NABRE	Revelation	3	10	Because you have kept my message of endurance , [ g ] I will keep you safe in the time of trial that is going to come to the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth .

Mt 10:32 . - 3:7–13 The letter to Philadelphia praises the Christians there for remaining faithful even with their limited strength ( Rev 3:8 ) . Members of the assembly of Satan are again singled out ( Rev 3:9 ; see Rev 2:9 ) . There is no admonition ; rather , the letter promises that they will be kept safe at the great trial ( Rev 3:10–11 ) and that the victors will become pillars of the heavenly temple , upon which three names will be inscribed : God , Jerusalem , and Christ ( Rev 3:12 ) . - 3:7 Philadelphia : modern Alasehir , ca . thirty miles southeast of Sardis , founded by Attalus II Philadelphus of Pergamum to be an “ open door ” ( Rev 3:8 ) for Greek culture ; it was destroyed by an earthquake in A.D.
NABRE	Revelation	3	16	[ l ] So , because you are lukewarm , neither hot nor cold , I will spit you out of my mouth .
NABRE	Revelation	3	17	. Rebuilt by money from the Emperor Tiberius , the city was renamed Neo-Caesarea ; this may explain the allusions to “ name ” in Rev 3:12 . Key of David : to the heavenly city of David ( cf . Is 22:22 ) , “ the new Jerusalem ” ( Rev 3:12 ) , over which Christ has supreme authority . - 3:8 An open door : opportunities for sharing and proclaiming the faith ; cf . Acts 14:27 ;
NABRE	Revelation	3	18	I advise you to buy from me gold refined by fire [ n ] so that you may be rich , and white garments to put on so that your shameful nakedness may not be exposed , and buy ointment to smear on your eyes so that you may see .
NABRE	Revelation	3	19	Those whom I love , I reprove and chastise . Be earnest , therefore , and repent . ( J )

NABRE	Revelation	3	22	“ ‘ “ Whoever has ears ought to hear what the Spirit says to the churches. ” ’ ” Footnotes - 3:1–6 The letter to Sardis does not praise the community but admonishes its members to watchfulness , mutual support , and repentance ( Rev 3:2–3 ) . The few who have remained pure and faithful will share Christ ’ s victory and will be inscribed in the book of life ( Rev 3:4–5 ) . - 3:1 Sardis : this city , located ca . thirty miles southeast of Thyatira , was once the capital of Lydia , known for its wealth at the time of Croesus ( 6th century B.C. ) . Its citadel , reputed to be unassailable , was captured by surprise , first by Cyrus and later by Antiochus . The church is therefore warned to be on guard . - 3:5 In white : white is a sign of victory and joy as well as resurrection ; see note on Rev 2:17 .

NABRE	Revelation	4	4	Surrounding the throne I saw twenty-four other thrones on which twenty-four elders [ d ] sat , dressed in white garments and with gold crowns on their heads . ( B )
NABRE	Revelation	4	1	and
NABRE	Revelation	4	2	[ c ] At once I was caught up in spirit . ( A ) A throne was there in heaven , and on the throne sat
NABRE	Revelation	4	3	one whose appearance sparkled like jasper and carnelian . Around the throne was a halo as brilliant as an emerald .
NABRE	Revelation	4	5	From the throne came flashes of lightning , rumblings , and peals of thunder . [ e ] Seven flaming torches burned in front of the throne , which are the seven spirits of God .
NABRE	Revelation	4	6	( C ) In front of the throne was something that resembled a sea of glass like crystal . [ f ] In the center and around the throne , there were four living creatures covered with eyes in front and in back .
NABRE	Revelation	4	7	The first creature resembled a lion , the second was like a calf , the third had a face like that of a human being , and the fourth looked like an eagle [ g ] in flight .
NABRE	Revelation	4	8	The four living creatures , each of them with six wings , [ h ] were covered with eyes inside and out . Day and night they do not stop exclaiming : “ Holy , holy , holy is the Lord God almighty , who was , and who is , and who is to come. ” ( D )
NABRE	Revelation	4	9	Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the one who sits on the throne , who lives forever and ever ,
NABRE	Revelation	4	10	. - 4:4 Twenty-four elders : these represent the twelve tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles ; cf .

NABRE	Revelation	4	11	“ Worthy are you , Lord our God , to receive glory and honor and power , for you created all things ; because of your will they came to be and were created. ” ( E ) Footnotes - 4:1–11 The seer now describes a vision of the heavenly court in worship of God enthroned . He reverently avoids naming or describing God but pictures twenty-four elders in priestly and regal attire ( Rev 4:4 ) and God ’ s throne and its surroundings made of precious gems and other symbols that traditionally express the majesty of God ( Rev 4:5–6 ) . Universal creation is represented by the four living creatures ( Rev 4:6–7 ) . Along with the twenty-four elders , they praise God unceasingly in humble adoration ( Rev 4:8–11 ) . - 4:1 The ancients viewed heaven as a solid vault , entered by way of actual doors . - 4:2–8 Much of the imagery here is taken from Ez
NABRE	Revelation	4	13	. The seven spirits of God : the seven “ angels of the presence ” as in Rev 8:2 and Tb 12:15 . - 4:6 A sea of glass like crystal : an image adapted from Ez 1:22–26 . Four living creatures : these are symbols taken from Ez 1:5–21 ; they are identified as cherubim in Ez 10:20 . Covered with eyes : these suggest God ’ s knowledge and concern . - 4:7 Lion…calf…human being…eagle : these symbolize , respectively , what is noblest , strongest , wisest , and swiftest in creation . Calf : traditionally translated “ ox , ” the Greek word refers to a heifer or young bull . Since the second century , these four creatures have been used as symbols of the evangelists Mark , Luke , Matthew , and John , respectively . - 4:8 Six wings : like the seraphim of Is 6:2 .

NABRE	Revelation	5	5	One of the elders said to me , “ Do not weep . The lion of the tribe of Judah , the root of David , [ c ] has triumphed , enabling him to open the scroll with its seven seals. ” ( B )
NABRE	Revelation	5	1	Pt 1:18–19 . This is the main title for Christ in Revelation , used twenty-eight times . Seven horns and seven eyes : Christ has the fullness ( see note on Rev 1:4 ) of power ( horns ) and knowledge ( eyes ) ; cf . Zec 4:7 . [ Seven ] spirits : as in Rev 1:4 ; 3:1 ; 4:5 . - 5:11 Countless : literally , “ 100,000,000 plus 1,000,000 , ” used by the author to express infinity .

NABRE	Revelation	5	2	Then I saw a mighty angel who proclaimed in a loud voice , “ Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals ? ”
NABRE	Revelation	5	3	But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to examine it .
NABRE	Revelation	5	4	I shed many tears because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to examine it .
NABRE	Revelation	5	6	Then I saw standing in the midst of the throne and the four living creatures and the elders a Lamb [ d ] that seemed to have been slain . He had seven horns and seven eyes ; these are the [ seven ] spirits of God sent out into the whole world . ( C )
NABRE	Revelation	5	7	He came and received the scroll from the right hand of the one who sat on the throne .
NABRE	Revelation	5	8	When he took it , the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb . Each of the elders held a harp and gold bowls filled with incense , which are the prayers of the holy ones .
NABRE	Revelation	5	9	They sang a new hymn : “ Worthy are you to receive the scroll and to break open its seals , for you were slain and with your blood you purchased for God those from every tribe and tongue , people and nation .

NABRE	Revelation	5	13	Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea , everything in the universe , cry out : “ To the one who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor , glory and might , forever and ever. ”
NABRE	Revelation	5	14	The four living creatures answered , “ Amen , ” and the elders fell down and worshiped . Footnotes - 5:1–14 The seer now describes a papyrus roll in God ’ s right hand ( Rev 5:1 ) with seven seals indicating the importance of the message . A mighty angel asks who is worthy to open the scroll , i.e. , who can accomplish God ’ s salvific plan ( Rev 5:2 ) . There is despair at first when no one in creation can do it ( Rev 5:3–4 ) . But the seer is comforted by an elder who tells him that Christ , called the lion of the tribe of Judah , has won the right to open it ( Rev 5:5 ) . Christ then appears as a Lamb , coming to receive the scroll from God ( Rev 5:6–7 ) , for which he is acclaimed as at a coronation ( Rev 5:8–10 ) . This is followed by a doxology of the angels ( Rev 5:11–12 ) and then finally by the heavenly church united with all of creation ( Rev 5:13–14 ) . - 5:1 A scroll : a papyrus roll possibly containing a list of afflictions for sinners ( cf . Ez 2:9–10 ) or God ’ s plan for the world . Sealed with seven seals : it is totally hidden from all but God . Only the Lamb ( Rev 5:7–9 ) has the right to carry out the divine plan . - 5:5 The lion of the tribe of Judah , the root of David : these are the messianic titles applied to Christ to symbolize his victory ; cf . Rev 22:16 ; Gn 49:9 ; Is 11:1 ,

NABRE	Revelation	6	6	I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures . It said , “ A ration of wheat costs a day ’ s pay , [ g ] and three rations of barley cost a day ’ s pay . But do not damage the olive oil or the wine. ” ( C )
NABRE	Revelation	6	1	Kgs 5:8 . Do not damage : the olive and the vine are to be used more sparingly in time of famine . - 6:8 Pale green : symbol of death and decay ; cf . Ez 14:21 . - 6:9 The altar : this altar corresponds to the altar of holocausts in the temple in Jerusalem ; see also Rev 11:1 . Because of the witness…word of God : literally , “ because of the word of God and the witness they had borne. ” - 6:10 Holy and true master : Old Testament usage as well as the context indicates that this is addressed to God rather than to Christ . - 6:12–14 Symbolic rather than literal description of the cosmic upheavals attending the day of the Lord when the martyrs ’ prayer for vindication ( Rev 6:10 ) would be answered ; cf . Am 8:8–9 ; Is 34:4 ; 50:3 ; Jl 2:10 ; 3:3–4 ; Mt 24:4–36 ; Mk 13:5–37 ; Lk 21:8–36 . - 6:12 Dark sackcloth : for mourning , sackcloth was made from the skin of a black goat . - 6:13 Unripe figs : literally , “ summer ( or winter ) fruit. ” - 6:14 Was divided : literally , “ was split , ” like a broken papyrus roll torn in two , each half then curling up to form a roll on either side . - 6:15 Nobles : literally , “ courtiers , ” “ grandees. ” Military officers : literally , “ commanders of 1,000 men , ” used in Josephus and other Greek authors as the equivalent of the Roman tribunus militum . The listing of various ranks of society represents the universality of terror at the impending doom . - 6:17 Their : this reading is attested in the best manuscripts , but the vast majority read “ his ” in reference to the wrath of the Lamb in the preceding verse .

NABRE	Revelation	6	4	[ e ] ( B ) Another horse came out , a red one . Its rider was given power to take peace away from the earth , so that people would slaughter one another . And he was given a huge sword .
NABRE	Revelation	6	5	When he broke open the third seal , I heard the third living creature cry out , “ Come forward. ” I looked , and there was a black horse , [ f ] and its rider held a scale in his hand .
NABRE	Revelation	6	7	;
NABRE	Revelation	6	8	I looked , and there was a pale green [ h ] horse . Its rider was named Death , and Hades accompanied him . They were given authority over a quarter of the earth , to kill with sword , famine , and plague , and by means of the beasts of the earth . ( D )
NABRE	Revelation	6	9	When he broke open the fifth seal , I saw underneath the altar [ i ] the souls of those who had been slaughtered because of the witness they bore to the word of God .

NABRE	Revelation	6	13	; cf .
NABRE	Revelation	6	14	) . - 6:1–17 This chapter provides a symbolic description of the contents of the sealed scroll . The breaking of the first four seals reveals four riders . The first rider ( of a white horse ) is a conquering power ( Rev 6:1–2 ) , the second ( red horse ) a symbol of bloody war ( Rev 6:3–4 ) , the third ( black horse ) a symbol of famine ( Rev 6:5–6 ) , the fourth ( pale green horse ) a symbol of Death himself , accompanied by Hades ( the netherworld ) as his page ( Rev 6:7–8 ) . Rev 6:8b summarizes the role of all four riders . The breaking of the fifth seal reveals Christian martyrs in an attitude of sacrifice as blood poured out at the foot of an altar begging God for vindication , which will come only when their quota is filled ; but they are given a white robe symbolic of victory ( Rev 6:9–11 ) . The breaking of the sixth seal reveals typical apocalyptic signs in the sky and the sheer terror of all people at the imminent divine judgment ( Rev 6:12–17 ) . - 6:1–8 The imagery is adapted from Zec 1:8–10 ; 6:1–8 . - 6:2 White horse…bow : this may perhaps allude specifically to the Parthians on the eastern border of the Roman empire . Expert in the use of the bow , they constantly harassed the Romans and won a major victory in A.D.
NABRE	Revelation	6	15	The kings of the earth , the nobles , [ o ] the military officers , the rich , the powerful , and every slave and free person hid themselves in caves and among mountain crags .
NABRE	Revelation	6	16	,
NABRE	Revelation	6	17	because the great day of their [ p ] wrath has come and who can withstand it ? ” Footnotes - 6:1–16:21 A series of seven disasters now begins as each seal is broken ( Rev 6:1–8:1 ) , followed by a similar series as seven trumpets sound ( Rev 8:2–11:19 ) and as seven angels pour bowls on the earth causing plagues ( Rev 15:1–16:21 ) . These gloomy sequences are interrupted by longer or shorter scenes suggesting the triumph of God and his witnesses ( e.g. , Rev
NABRE	Revelation	6	62	; see note on Rev 9:13–21 . But the Old Testament imagery typifies the history of oppression of God ’ s people at all times . - 6:4 Huge sword : this is a symbol of war and violence ; cf . Ez 21:14–17 . - 6:5 Black horse : this is a symbol of famine , the usual accompaniment of war in antiquity ; cf . Lv 26:26 ; Ez 4:12–13 . The scale is a symbol of shortage of food with a corresponding rise in price . - 6:6 A day ’ s pay : literally , “ a denarius , ” a Roman silver coin that constitutes a day ’ s wage in Mt 20:2 . Because of the famine , food was rationed and sold at an exorbitant price . A liter of flour was considered a day ’ s ration in the Greek historians Herodotus and Diogenes Laertius . Barley : food of the poor ( Jn 6:9 ,
NABRE	Revelation	6	18	) ; it was also used to feed animals ; cf .

NABRE	Revelation	7	2	Cor 1:22 ; Eph 1:13 ; 4:30 . The second vision ( Rev 7:9–17 ) portrays the faithful Christians before God ’ s throne to encourage those on earth to persevere to the end , even to death . - 7:1 The four corners of the earth : the earth is seen as a table or rectangular surface . - 7:2 East : literally , “ rising of the sun. ” The east was considered the source of light and the place of paradise ( Gn 2:8 ) . Seal : whatever was marked by the impression of one ’ s signet ring belonged to that person and was under his protection . - 7:4–9 One hundred and forty-four thousand : the square of twelve ( the number of Israel ’ s tribes ) multiplied by a thousand , symbolic of the new Israel ( cf . Rev 14:1–5 ; Gal 6:16 ; Jas 1:1 ) that embraces people from every nation , race , people , and tongue ( Rev 7:9 ) . - 7:5–8 Judah is placed first because of Christ ; cf . “ the Lion of the tribe of Judah ” ( Rev 5:5 ) . Dan is omitted because of a later tradition that the antichrist would arise from it . - 7:9 White robes…palm branches : symbols of joy and victory ; see note on Rev 3:5 . - 7:10 Salvation comes from : literally , “ ( let ) salvation ( be ascribed ) to. ” A similar hymn of praise is found at the fall of the dragon ( Rev 12:10 ) and of Babylon ( Rev 19:1 ) . - 7:14 Time of great distress : fierce persecution by the Romans ; cf . Introduction . - 7:17 Life-giving water : literally , “ the water of life , ” God ’ s grace , which flows from Christ ; cf . Rev 21:6 ; 22:1 ,
NABRE	Revelation	7	3	“ Do not damage the land or the sea or the trees until we put the seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God. ” ( B )
NABRE	Revelation	7	4	I heard the number of those who had been marked with the seal , one hundred and forty-four thousand marked [ d ] from every tribe of the Israelites : ( C )

NABRE	Revelation	8	8	[ e ] When the second angel blew his trumpet , something like a large burning mountain was hurled into the sea . A third of the sea turned to blood , ( F )
NABRE	Revelation	8	1	When he broke open the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven [ b ] for about half an hour . ( A )
NABRE	Revelation	8	2	And I saw that the seven angels who stood before God were given seven trumpets . ( B ) The Gold Censer .
NABRE	Revelation	8	3	Another angel came and stood at the altar , [ c ] holding a gold censer . He was given a great quantity of incense to offer , along with the prayers of all the holy ones , on the gold altar that was before the throne . ( C )
NABRE	Revelation	8	4	The smoke of the incense along with the prayers of the holy ones went up before God from the hand of the angel .
NABRE	Revelation	8	5	Then the angel took the censer , filled it with burning coals from the altar , and hurled it down to the earth . There were peals of thunder , rumblings , flashes of lightning , and an earthquake . ( D ) The First Four Trumpets .
NABRE	Revelation	8	6	) . Then follow the first four trumpet blasts , each heralding catastrophes modeled on the plagues of Egypt affecting the traditional prophetic third ( cf . Ez 5:12 ) of the earth , sea , fresh water , and stars ( Rev 8:7–12 ) . Finally , there is a vision of an eagle warning of the last three trumpet blasts ( Rev 8:13 ) . - 8:1 Silence in heaven : as in Zep 1:7 , a prelude to the eschatological woes that are to follow ; cf . Introduction . - 8:3 Altar : there seems to be only one altar in the heavenly temple , corresponding to the altar of holocausts in Rev 6:9 , and here to the altar of incense in Jerusalem ; cf . also Rev 9:13 ; 11:1 ; 14:18 ; 16:7 . - 8:7 This woe resembles the seventh plague of Egypt ( Ex 9:23–24 ) ; cf . Jl 3:3 . - 8:8–11 The background of these two woes is the first plague of Egypt ( Ex 7:20–21 ) . - 8:9 Creatures living in the sea : literally , “ creatures in the sea that had souls. ” - 8:11 Wormwood : an extremely bitter and malignant plant symbolizing the punishment God inflicts on the ungodly ; cf . Jer 9:12–14 ; 23:15 . - 8:13 Woe ! Woe ! Woe : each of the three woes pronounced by the angel represents a separate disaster ; cf . Rev 9:12 ; 11:14 . The final woe , released by the seventh trumpet blast , includes the plagues of Rev
NABRE	Revelation	8	7	When the first one blew his trumpet , there came hail and fire mixed with blood , which was hurled down to the earth . A third of the land was burned up , along with a third of the trees and all green grass . [ d ]
NABRE	Revelation	8	9	a third of the creatures living in the sea [ f ] died , and a third of the ships were wrecked .
NABRE	Revelation	8	10	When the third angel blew his trumpet , a large star burning like a torch fell from the sky . It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water . ( G )
NABRE	Revelation	8	11	The star was called “ Wormwood , ” [ g ] and a third of all the water turned to wormwood . Many people died from this water , because it was made bitter . ( H )
NABRE	Revelation	8	12	When the fourth angel blew his trumpet , a third of the sun , a third of the moon , and a third of the stars were struck , so that a third of them became dark . The day lost its light for a third of the time , as did the night . ( I )
NABRE	Revelation	8	13	Then I looked again and heard an eagle flying high overhead cry out in a loud voice , “ Woe ! Woe ! Woe [ h ] to the inhabitants of the earth from the rest of the trumpet blasts that the three angels are about to blow ! ” Footnotes - 8:1–13 The breaking of the seventh seal produces at first silence and then seven symbolic disasters , each announced by a trumpet blast , of which the first four form a unit as did the first four seals .

NABRE	Revelation	9	9	and they had chests like iron breastplates . The sound of their wings was like the sound of many horse-drawn chariots racing into battle .
NABRE	Revelation	9	1	Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet , and I saw a star [ b ] that had fallen from the sky to the earth . It was given the key for the passage to the abyss .
NABRE	Revelation	9	2	It opened the passage to the abyss , ( A ) and smoke came up out of the passage like smoke from a huge furnace . The sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the passage . ( B )
NABRE	Revelation	9	3	Locusts came out of the smoke onto the land , and they were given the same power as scorpions [ c ] of the earth . ( C )
NABRE	Revelation	9	4	They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or any tree , but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads .
NABRE	Revelation	9	5	They were not allowed to kill them but only to torment them for five months ; [ d ] the torment they inflicted was like that of a scorpion when it stings a person .
NABRE	Revelation	9	6	During that time these people will seek death but will not find it , and they will long to die but death will escape them . ( D )
NABRE	Revelation	9	7	[ e ] The appearance of the locusts was like that of horses ready for battle . On their heads they wore what looked like crowns of gold ; their faces were like human faces , ( E )
NABRE	Revelation	9	8	and they had hair like women ’ s hair . Their teeth were like lions ’ teeth , ( F )
NABRE	Revelation	9	10	They had tails like scorpions , with stingers ; with their tails they had power to harm people for five months .
NABRE	Revelation	9	11	They had as their king the angel of the abyss , whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon [ f ] and in Greek Apollyon .

NABRE	Revelation	9	13	) , but a comparison with Rev 1:20 and Rev 20:1 suggests that here it means an angel . The passage to the abyss : referring to Sheol , the netherworld , where Satan and the fallen angels are kept for a thousand years , to be cast afterwards into the pool of fire ; cf . Rev 20:7–10 . The abyss was conceived of as a vast subterranean cavern full of fire . Its only link with the earth was a kind of passage or mine shaft , which was kept locked . - 9:3 Scorpions : their poisonous sting was proverbial ; Ez 2:6 ; Lk 11:12 . - 9:5 For five months : more or less corresponding to the life-span of locusts . - 9:7–10 Eight characteristics are listed to show the eschatological and diabolical nature of these locusts . - 9:11 Abaddon : Hebrew ( more precisely , Aramaic ) for destruction or ruin . Apollyon : Greek for the “ Destroyer. ” - 9:13–21 The sixth trumpet heralds a woe representing another diabolical attack symbolized by an invasion by the Parthians living east of the Euphrates ; see note on Rev 6:2 . At the appointed time ( Rev 9:15 ) , the frightful horses act as God ’ s agents of judgment . The imaginative details are not to be taken literally ; see Introduction and the note on Rev 6:12–14 . - 9:13 [ Four ] : many Greek manuscripts and versions omit the word . The horns were situated at the four corners of the altar ( Ex 27:2 ; 30:2–3 ) ; see note on Rev 8:3 . - 9:14–15 The four angels : they are symbolic of the destructive activity that will be extended throughout the universe . - 9:17 Blue : literally , “ hyacinth-colored. ” Yellow : literally , “ sulfurous. ” - 9:20 The works of their hands : i.e. , the gods their hands had made .

NABRE	Revelation	9	15	So the four angels were released , who were prepared for this hour , day , month , and year to kill a third of the human race .
NABRE	Revelation	9	16	The number of cavalry troops was two hundred million ; I heard their number .
NABRE	Revelation	9	17	Now in my vision this is how I saw the horses and their riders . They wore red , blue , and yellow breastplates , [ j ] and the horses ’ heads were like heads of lions , and out of their mouths came fire , smoke , and sulfur . ( H )
NABRE	Revelation	9	18	By these three plagues of fire , smoke , and sulfur that came out of their mouths a third of the human race was killed .
NABRE	Revelation	9	19	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails ; for their tails are like snakes , with heads that inflict harm .
NABRE	Revelation	9	20	The rest of the human race , who were not killed by these plagues , did not repent of the works of their hands , [ k ] to give up the worship of demons and idols made from gold , silver , bronze , stone , and wood , which can not see or hear or walk . ( I )
NABRE	Revelation	9	21	Nor did they repent of their murders , their magic potions , their unchastity , or their robberies . Footnotes - 9:1–12 The fifth trumpet heralds a woe containing elements from the eighth and ninth plagues of Egypt ( Ex 10:12–15 , 21–23 ) but specifically reminiscent of the invasion of locusts in Jl 1:4–2:10 . - 9:1 A star : late Judaism represented fallen powers as stars ( Is 14:12–15 ; Lk 10:18 ; Jude

The second vision is of the measuring of the temple and of two witnesses , whose martyrdom means that the kingdom of God is about to be inaugurated . - 10:2 He placed…on the land : this symbolizes the universality of the angel ’ s message , as does the figure of the small scroll open to be read . - 10:3 The seven thunders : God ’ s voice announcing judgment and doom ; cf . Ps 29:3–9 , where thunder , as the voice of Yahweh , is praised seven times . - 10:6 Heaven and earth and sea : the three parts of the universe . No more delay : cf .

NABRE	Revelation	11	7	When they have finished their testimony , the beast that comes up from the abyss [ f ] will wage war against them and conquer them and kill them . ( D )
NABRE	Revelation	11	8	; 17:8 ) ; cf . Dn 7:2–8 , 11–12 , 19–22 and Introduction . - 11:8 The great city : this expression is used constantly in Revelation for Babylon , i.e. , Rome ; cf . Rev 14:8 ; 16:19 ; 17:18 ; 18:2 ,
NABRE	Revelation	11	9	[ h ] Those from every people , tribe , tongue , and nation will gaze on their corpses for three and a half days , and they will not allow their corpses to be buried .
NABRE	Revelation	11	10	,
NABRE	Revelation	11	12	Then they heard a loud voice from heaven say to them , “ Come up here. ” So they went up to heaven in a cloud as their enemies looked on . ( F )
NABRE	Revelation	11	13	At that moment there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city fell in ruins . Seven thousand people [ i ] were killed during the earthquake ; the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven .
NABRE	Revelation	11	14	The second woe has passed , but the third is coming soon . The Seventh Trumpet . [ j ]
NABRE	Revelation	11	15	Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet . There were loud voices in heaven , saying , “ The kingdom of the world now belongs to our Lord and to his Anointed , and he will reign forever and ever. ”
NABRE	Revelation	11	16	The twenty-four elders who sat on their thrones before God prostrated themselves and worshiped God
NABRE	Revelation	11	17	and said : “ We give thanks to you , Lord God almighty , who are and who were . For you have assumed your great power and have established your reign .
NABRE	Revelation	11	18	The nations raged , but your wrath has come , and the time for the dead to be judged , and to recompense your servants , the prophets , and the holy ones and those who fear your name , the small and the great alike , and to destroy those who destroy the earth. ” ( G )
NABRE	Revelation	11	19	Then God ’ s temple in heaven was opened , and the ark of his covenant could be seen in the temple . There were flashes of lightning , rumblings , and peals of thunder , an earthquake , and a violent hailstorm . Footnotes - 11:1 The temple and altar symbolize the new Israel ; see note on Rev 7:4–9 . The worshipers represent Christians . The measuring of the temple ( cf . Ez 40:3–42:20 ; 47:1–12 ; Zec 2:5–6 ) suggests that God will preserve the faithful remnant ( cf . Is 4:2–3 ) who remain true to Christ ( Rev 14:1–5 ) . - 11:2 The outer court : the Court of the Gentiles . Trample…forty-two months : the duration of the vicious persecution of the Jews by Antiochus IV Epiphanes ( Dn 7:25 ; 12:7 ) ; this persecution of three and a half years ( half of seven , counted as
NABRE	Revelation	11	1260	days in Rev 11:3 ; 12:6 ) became the prototype of periods of trial for God ’ s people ; cf . Lk 4:25 ; Jas 5:17 . The reference here is to the persecution by the Romans ; cf . Introduction . - 11:3 The two witnesses , wearing sackcloth symbolizing lamentation and repentance , can not readily be identified . Do they represent Moses and Elijah , or the Law and the Prophets , or Peter and Paul ? Most probably they refer to the universal church , especially the Christian martyrs , fulfilling the office of witness ( two because of Dt 19:15 ; cf . Mk 6:7 ; Jn 8:17 ) . - 11:4 The two olive trees and the two lampstands : the martyrs who stand in the presence of the Lord ; the imagery is taken from Zec 4:8–14 , where the olive trees refer to Zerubbabel and Joshua . - 11:5–6 These details are derived from stories of Moses , who turned water into blood ( Ex 7:17–20 ) , and of Elijah , who called down fire from heaven (
NABRE	Revelation	11	21	. “ Sodom ” and “ Egypt ” : symbols of immorality ( cf . Is 1:10 ) and oppression of God ’ s people ( cf . Ex 1:11–14 ) . Where indeed their Lord was crucified : not the geographical but the symbolic Jerusalem that rejects God and his witnesses , i.e. , Rome , called Babylon in Rev 16–18 ; see note on Rev 17:9 and Introduction . - 11:9–12 Over the martyrdom ( Rev 11:7 ) of the two witnesses , now called prophets , the ungodly rejoice for three and a half days , a symbolic period of time ; see note on Rev 11:2 . Afterwards they go in triumph to heaven , as did Elijah (

NABRE	Revelation	12	2	She was with child and wailed aloud in pain as she labored to give birth . [ c ]
NABRE	Revelation	12	3	Then another sign appeared in the sky ; it was a huge red dragon , [ d ] with seven heads and ten horns , and on its heads were seven diadems . ( B )
NABRE	Revelation	12	4	Its tail swept away a third of the stars in the sky and hurled them down to the earth . Then the dragon stood before the woman about to give birth , to devour her child when she gave birth . ( C )
NABRE	Revelation	12	5	She gave birth to a son , a male child , destined to rule all the nations with an iron rod . [ e ] Her child was caught up to God and his throne . ( D )
NABRE	Revelation	12	6	The woman herself fled into the desert where she had a place prepared by God , that there she might be taken care of for twelve hundred and sixty days . [ f ]
NABRE	Revelation	12	7	[ g ] Then war broke out in heaven ; Michael [ h ] and his angels battled against the dragon . The dragon and its angels fought back ,
NABRE	Revelation	12	8	but they did not prevail and there was no longer any place for them in heaven .
NABRE	Revelation	12	9	. In Hebrew , the name Michael means “ Who can compare with God ? ” ; cf . Rev 13:4 . - 12:9 The ancient serpent : who seduced Eve ( Gn 3:1–6 ) , mother of the human race ; cf . Rev 20:2 ; Eph 6:11–12 . Was thrown down : allusion to the expulsion of Satan from heaven ; cf . Lk 10:18 . - 12:10 The accuser : the meaning of the Hebrew word “ Satan , ” found in Rev 12:9 ; Jb 1–2 ; Zec 3:1 ;
NABRE	Revelation	12	10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say : “ Now have salvation and power come , and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Anointed . For the accuser [ j ] of our brothers is cast out , who accuses them before our God day and night .
NABRE	Revelation	12	11	They conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony ; love for life did not deter them from death .
NABRE	Revelation	12	13	When the dragon saw that it had been thrown down to the earth , it pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child . ( F )
NABRE	Revelation	12	14	But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle , [ k ] so that she could fly to her place in the desert , where , far from the serpent , she was taken care of for a year , two years , and a half-year . ( G )
NABRE	Revelation	12	15	The serpent , [ l ] however , spewed a torrent of water out of his mouth after the woman to sweep her away with the current .
NABRE	Revelation	12	16	But the earth helped the woman and opened its mouth and swallowed the flood that the dragon spewed out of its mouth .
NABRE	Revelation	12	17	Then the dragon became angry with the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring , those who keep God ’ s commandments and bear witness to Jesus . [ m ] ( H )
NABRE	Revelation	12	18	It took its position [ n ] on the sand of the sea . Footnotes - 12:1–14:20 This central section of Revelation portrays the power of evil , represented by a dragon , in opposition to God and his people . First , the dragon pursues the woman about to give birth , but her son is saved and “ caught up to God and his throne ” ( Rev 12:5 ) . Then Michael and his angels cast the dragon and his angels out of heaven ( Rev 12:7–9 ) . After this , the dragon tries to attack the boy indirectly by attacking members of his church ( Rev 12:13–17 ) . A beast , symbolizing the Roman empire , then becomes the dragon ’ s agent , mortally wounded but restored to life and worshiped by all the world ( Rev 13:1–10 ) . A second beast arises from the land , symbolizing the antichrist , which leads people astray by its prodigies to idolize the first beast ( Rev 13:11–18 ) . This is followed by a vision of the Lamb and his faithful ones , and the proclamation of imminent judgment upon the world in terms of the wine of God ’ s wrath ( Rev 14:1–20 ) . - 12:1–6 The woman adorned with the sun , the moon , and the stars ( images taken from Gn 37:9–10 ) symbolizes God ’ s people in the Old and the New Testament . The Israel of old gave birth to the Messiah ( Rev 12:5 ) and then became the new Israel , the church , which suffers persecution by the dragon ( Rev 12:6 , 13–17 ) ; cf . Is 50:1 ; 66:7 ; Jer 50:12 . This corresponds to a widespread myth throughout the ancient world that a goddess pregnant with a savior was pursued by a horrible monster ; by miraculous intervention , she bore a son who then killed the monster . - 12:2 Because of Eve ’ s sin , the woman gives birth in distress and pain ( Gn 3:16 ; cf . Is 66:7–14 ) . - 12:3 Huge red dragon : the Devil or Satan ( cf . Rev 12:9 ; 20:2 ) , symbol of the forces of evil , a mythical monster known also as Leviathan ( Ps 74:13–14 ) or Rahab ( Jb 26:12–13 ; Ps 89:11 ) . Seven diadems : these are symbolic of the fullness of the dragon ’ s sovereignty over the kingdoms of this world ; cf . Christ with many diadems ( Rev 19:12 ) . - 12:5 Rule…iron rod : fulfilled in Rev 19:15 ; cf . Ps 2:9 . Was caught up to God : reference to Christ ’ s ascension . - 12:6 God protects the persecuted church in the desert , the traditional Old Testament place of refuge for the afflicted , according to the typology of the Exodus ; see note on Rev 11:2 . - 12:7–12 Michael , mentioned only here in Revelation , wins a victory over the dragon . A hymn of praise follows . - 12:7 Michael : the archangel , guardian and champion of Israel ; cf . Dn 10:13 ,

NABRE	Revelation	13	1	Then I saw a beast come out of the sea with ten horns and seven heads ; on its horns were ten diadems , and on its heads blasphemous name [ s ] . ( A )
NABRE	Revelation	13	2	Thes 2:9 ; cf . also Dt 13:2–4 . Christians had either to worship the emperor and his image or to suffer martyrdom . - 13:18 Each of the letters of the alphabet in Hebrew as well as in Greek has a numerical value . Many possible combinations of letters will add up to
NABRE	Revelation	13	3	I saw that one of its heads seemed to have been mortally wounded , but this mortal wound was healed . [ c ] Fascinated , the whole world followed after the beast .
NABRE	Revelation	13	4	They worshiped the dragon because it gave its authority to the beast ; they also worshiped the beast [ d ] and said , “ Who can compare with the beast or who can fight against it ? ”

NABRE	Revelation	13	8	All the inhabitants of the earth will worship it , all whose names were not written from the foundation of the world in the book of life , which belongs to the Lamb who was slain . ( E )

NABRE	Revelation	13	10	Anyone destined for captivity goes into captivity . Anyone destined to be slain by the sword shall be slain by the sword . ( G ) Such is the faithful endurance of the holy ones . The Second Beast . [ g ]
NABRE	Revelation	13	11	,
NABRE	Revelation	13	12	It wielded all the authority of the first beast in its sight and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast , whose mortal wound had been healed .
NABRE	Revelation	13	14	) . - 13:11–18 The second beast is described in terms of the false prophets ( cf . Rev 16:13 ; 19:20 ; 20:10 ) who accompany the false messiahs ( the first beast ) ; cf . Mt 24:24 ; Mk 13:22 ;
NABRE	Revelation	13	15	It was then permitted to breathe life into the beast ’ s image , so that the beast ’ s image could speak and [ could ] have anyone who did not worship it put to death . ( I )
NABRE	Revelation	13	16	It forced all the people , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to be given a stamped image on their right hands or their foreheads , ( J )
NABRE	Revelation	13	17	so that no one could buy or sell except one who had the stamped image of the beast ’ s name or the number that stood for its name .
NABRE	Revelation	13	18	[ h ] ( K ) Wisdom is needed here ; one who understands can calculate the number of the beast , for it is a number that stands for a person . His number is six hundred and sixty-six . Footnotes - 13:1–10 This wild beast , combining features of the four beasts in Dn 7:2–28 , symbolizes the Roman empire ; the seven heads represent the emperors ; see notes on Rev 17:10 and Rev 17:12–14 . The blasphemous names are the divine titles assumed by the emperors . - 13:2 Satan ( Rev 12:9 ) , the prince of this world ( Jn 12:31 ) , commissioned the beast to persecute the church ( Rev 13:5–7 ) . - 13:3 This may be a reference to the popular legend that Nero would come back to life and rule again after his death ( which occurred in A.D.
NABRE	Revelation	13	68	from a self-inflicted stab wound in the throat ) ; cf . Rev 13:14 ; Rev 17:8 . Domitian ( A.D. 81–96 ) embodied all the cruelty and impiety of Nero . Cf . Introduction . - 13:4 Worshiped the beast : allusion to emperor worship , which Domitian insisted upon and ruthlessly enforced . Who can compare with the beast : perhaps a deliberate parody of the name Michael ; see note on Rev 12:7 . - 13:5–6 Domitian , like Antiochus IV Epiphanes ( Dn 7:8 ,
NABRE	Revelation	13	25	) , demanded that he be called by divine titles such as “ our lord and god ” and “ Jupiter. ” See note on Rev 11:2 . - 13:5 Forty-two months : this is the same duration as the profanation of the holy city ( Rev 11:2 ) , the prophetic mission of the two witnesses ( Rev 11:3 ) , and the retreat of the woman into the desert ( Rev 12:6 ,
NABRE	Revelation	13	666	, and many candidates have been nominated for this infamous number . The most likely is the emperor Caesar Nero ( see note on Rev 13:3 ) , the Greek form of whose name in Hebrew letters gives the required sum . ( The Latin form of this name equals
NABRE	Revelation	13	616	, which is the reading of a few manuscripts . ) Nero personifies the emperors who viciously persecuted the church . It has also been observed that “

NABRE	Revelation	14	1	Pt 2:22 ) . Unblemished : a cultic term taken from the vocabulary of sacrificial ritual . - 14:6–13 Three angels proclaim imminent judgment on the pagan world , calling all peoples to worship God the creator . Babylon ( Rome ) will fall , and its supporters will be tormented forever . - 14:6 Everlasting good news : that God ’ s eternal reign is about to begin ; see note on Rev 10:7 . - 14:8 This verse anticipates the lengthy dirge over Babylon ( Rome ) in Rev 18:1–19:4 . The oracle of Is 21:9 to Babylon is applied here . - 14:10–11 The wine of God ’ s fury : image taken from Is 51:17 ; Jer 25:15–16 ; 49:12 ; 51:7 ; Ez 23:31–34 . Eternal punishment in the fiery pool of burning sulfur ( or “ fire and brimstone ” ; cf . Gn 19:24 ) is also reserved for the Devil , the beast , and the false prophet ( Rev 19:20 ; 20:10 ; 21:8 ) . - 14:12 In addition to faith in Jesus , the seer insists upon the necessity and value of works , as in Rev 2:23 ; 20:12–13 ; 22:12 ; cf . Mt 16:27 ; Rom 2:6 . - 14:13 See note on Rev 1:3 . According to Jewish thought , people ’ s actions followed them as witnesses before the court of God . - 14:14–20 The reaping of the harvest symbolizes the gathering of the elect in the final judgment , while the reaping and treading of the grapes symbolizes the doom of the ungodly ( cf . Jl 4:12–13 ; Is 63:1–6 ) that will come in Rev 19:11–21 . - 14:18 Altar : there was only one altar in the heavenly temple ; see notes above on Rev 6:9 ; 8:3 ; 11:1 . - 14:20 Two hundred miles : literally sixteen hundred stades . The stadion , a Greek unit of measurement , was about

NABRE	Revelation	14	3	They were singing [ what seemed to be ] a new hymn before the throne , before the four living creatures and the elders . No one could learn this hymn except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been ransomed from the earth . ( B )
NABRE	Revelation	14	4	These are they who were not defiled with women ; they are virgins [ c ] and these are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes . They have been ransomed as the firstfruits of the human race for God and the Lamb . ( C )
NABRE	Revelation	14	5	On their lips no deceit [ d ] has been found ; they are unblemished . ( D ) The Three Angels . [ e ]
NABRE	Revelation	14	6	Then I saw another angel flying high overhead , with everlasting good news [ f ] to announce to those who dwell on earth , to every nation , tribe , tongue , and people .
NABRE	Revelation	14	7	He said in a loud voice , “ Fear God and give him glory , for his time has come to sit in judgment . Worship him who made heaven and earth and sea and springs of water. ” ( E )
NABRE	Revelation	14	8	A second angel followed , saying : “ Fallen , fallen is Babylon the great , ( F ) that made all the nations drink the wine of her licentious passion. ” [ g ]
NABRE	Revelation	14	9	A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice , “ Anyone who worships the beast or its image , or accepts its mark on forehead or hand ,
NABRE	Revelation	14	10	will also drink the wine of God ’ s fury , [ h ] poured full strength into the cup of his wrath , and will be tormented in burning sulfur before the holy angels and before the Lamb .
NABRE	Revelation	14	11	The smoke of the fire that torments them will rise forever and ever , and there will be no relief day or night for those who worship the beast or its image or accept the mark of its name. ” ( G )
NABRE	Revelation	14	12	Here is what sustains the holy ones who keep God ’ s commandments ( H ) and their faith in Jesus . [ i ]
NABRE	Revelation	14	13	( I ) I heard a voice from heaven say , “ Write this : Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. ” “ Yes , ” said the Spirit , “ let them find rest from their labors , for their works accompany them. ” [ j ] The Harvest of the Earth . [ k ]
NABRE	Revelation	14	15	Another angel came out of the temple , crying out in a loud voice to the one sitting on the cloud , “ Use your sickle and reap the harvest , for the time to reap has come , because the earth ’ s harvest is fully ripe. ” ( K )
NABRE	Revelation	14	16	So the one who was sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth , and the earth was harvested .
NABRE	Revelation	14	17	; Mi 4:6–8 ; Zep 3:12–20 . A hundred and forty-four thousand : see note on Rev 7:4–9 . His Father ’ s name…foreheads : in contrast to the pagans who were marked with the name or number of the beast ( Rev 13:16–17 ) . - 14:4 Virgins : metaphorically , because they never indulged in any idolatrous practices , which are considered in the Old Testament to be adultery and fornication ( Rev 2:14–15 , 20–22 ; 17:1–6 ; cf . Ez 16:1–58 ; 23:1–49 ) . The parallel passages ( Rev 7:3 ; 22:4 ) indicate that the 144,000 whose foreheads are sealed represent all Christian people . - 14:5 No deceit : because they did not deny Christ or do homage to the beast . Lying is characteristic of the opponents of Christ ( Jn 8:44 ) , but the Suffering Servant spoke no falsehood ( Is 53:9 ;
NABRE	Revelation	14	18	Then another angel [ came ] from the altar , [ l ] [ who ] was in charge of the fire , and cried out in a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle , “ Use your sharp sickle and cut the clusters from the earth ’ s vines , for its grapes are ripe. ”
NABRE	Revelation	14	19	So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and cut the earth ’ s vintage . He threw it into the great wine press of God ’ s fury . ( L )
NABRE	Revelation	14	20	The wine press was trodden outside the city and blood poured out of the wine press to the height of a horse ’ s bridle for two hundred miles .

NABRE	Revelation	15	15	The Seven Last Plagues .
NABRE	Revelation	15	1	[ a ] Then I saw in heaven another sign , [ b ] great and awe-inspiring : seven angels with the seven last plagues , for through them God ’ s fury is accomplished .
NABRE	Revelation	15	2	Mc 2:4–7 . Scripture texts , prefaces , introductions , footnotes and cross references used in this work are taken from the New American Bible , revised edition ©
NABRE	Revelation	15	3	and they sang the song of Moses , [ d ] the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb : “ Great and wonderful are your works , Lord God almighty . Just and true are your ways , O king of the nations . ( B )
NABRE	Revelation	15	4	Who will not fear you , Lord , or glorify your name ? For you alone are holy . All the nations will come and worship before you , for your righteous acts have been revealed. ” ( C )
NABRE	Revelation	15	5	[ e ] After this I had another vision . The temple that is the heavenly tent of testimony [ f ] opened ,
NABRE	Revelation	15	6	and the seven angels with the seven plagues came out of the temple . They were dressed in clean white linen , with a gold sash around their chests . ( D )
NABRE	Revelation	15	7	One of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven gold bowls filled with the fury of God , who lives forever and ever .
NABRE	Revelation	15	8	Then the temple became so filled with the smoke from God ’ s glory and might that no one could enter it until the seven plagues of the seven angels had been accomplished . ( E ) Footnotes - 15:1–16:21 The seven bowls , the third and last group of seven after the seven seals and the seven trumpets , foreshadow the final cataclysm . Again , the series is introduced by a heavenly prelude , in which the victors over the beast sing the canticle of Moses ( Rev 15:2–4 ) . - 15:1–4 A vision of the victorious martyrs precedes the vision of woe in Rev 15:5–16:21 ; cf . Rev 7:9–12 . - 15:2 Mingled with fire : fire symbolizes the sanctity involved in facing God , reflected in the trials that have prepared the victorious Christians or in God ’ s wrath . - 15:3 The song of Moses : the song that Moses and the Israelites sang after their escape from the oppression of Egypt ( Ex 15:1–18 ) . The martyrs have escaped from the oppression of the Devil . Nations : many other Greek manuscripts and versions read “ ages. ” - 15:5–8 Seven angels receive the bowls of God ’ s wrath . - 15:5 Tent of testimony : the name of the meeting tent in the Greek text of Ex

NABRE	Revelation	16	2	Chr 35:20–24 ) , the town became the symbol of the final disastrous rout of the forces of evil . - 16:19 The great city : Rome and the empire . - 16:20–21 See note on Rev 6:12–14 .

NABRE	Revelation	17	17	For God has put it into their minds to carry out his purpose and to make them come to an agreement to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God are accomplished .
NABRE	Revelation	17	1	[ a ] Then one of the seven angels who were holding the seven bowls came and said to me , “ Come here . I will show you the judgment on the great harlot [ b ] who lives near the many waters . ( A )
NABRE	Revelation	17	2	[ c ] The kings of the earth have had intercourse with her , ( B ) and the inhabitants of the earth became drunk on the wine of her harlotry. ”
NABRE	Revelation	17	3	Then he carried me away in spirit to a deserted place where I saw a woman seated on a scarlet beast [ d ] that was covered with blasphemous names , with seven heads and ten horns . ( C )
NABRE	Revelation	17	4	The woman was wearing purple and scarlet and adorned with gold , precious stones , and pearls . ( D ) She held in her hand a gold cup that was filled with the abominable and sordid deeds of her harlotry .
NABRE	Revelation	17	5	On her forehead was written a name , which is a mystery , “ Babylon the great , the mother of harlots and of the abominations of the earth. ”
NABRE	Revelation	17	6	[ e ] I saw that the woman was drunk on the blood of the holy ones and on the blood of the witnesses to Jesus . Meaning of the Beast and Harlot . [ f ] When I saw her I was greatly amazed .
NABRE	Revelation	17	7	The angel said to me , “ Why are you amazed ? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her , the beast with the seven heads and the ten horns .
NABRE	Revelation	17	8	[ g ] ( E ) The beast that you saw existed once but now exists no longer . It will come up from the abyss and is headed for destruction . The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world shall be amazed when they see the beast , because it existed once but exists no longer , and yet it will come again .
NABRE	Revelation	17	9	Here is a clue [ h ] for one who has wisdom . The seven heads represent seven hills upon which the woman sits . They also represent seven kings : ( F )
NABRE	Revelation	17	10	five have already fallen , one still lives , and the last has not yet come , [ i ] and when he comes he must remain only a short while .
NABRE	Revelation	17	11	The beast [ j ] that existed once but exists no longer is an eighth king , but really belongs to the seven and is headed for destruction .
NABRE	Revelation	17	12	The ten horns that you saw represent ten kings who have not yet been crowned ; [ k ] they will receive royal authority along with the beast for one hour . ( G )
NABRE	Revelation	17	13	They are of one mind and will give their power and authority to the beast .
NABRE	Revelation	17	14	They will fight with the Lamb , but the Lamb will conquer them , for he is Lord of lords and king of kings , and those with him are called , chosen , and faithful. ” ( H )
NABRE	Revelation	17	15	Then he said to me , “ The waters that you saw where the harlot lives represent large numbers of peoples , nations , and tongues .
NABRE	Revelation	17	16	The ten horns [ l ] that you saw and the beast will hate the harlot ; they will leave her desolate and naked ; they will eat her flesh and consume her with fire . ( I )
NABRE	Revelation	17	18	The woman whom you saw represents the great city that has sovereignty over the kings of the earth. ” Footnotes - 17:1–19:10 The punishment of Babylon is now described as a past event and , metaphorically , under the image of the great harlot who leads people astray into idolatry . - 17:1–6 Babylon , the symbolic name ( Rev 17:5 ) of Rome , is graphically described as “ the great harlot. ” - 17:2 Intercourse…harlotry : see note on Rev 14:4 .

The number seven ( Rev 17:9 ) suggests that all the emperors are meant ; see note on Rev 1:4 . - 17:11 The beast : Nero ; see note on Rev 17:8 . - 17:12–13 Ten kings who have not yet been crowned : perhaps Parthian satraps who are to accompany the revived Nero ( the beast ) in his march on Rome to regain power ; see note on Rev 13:3 . In Rev 19:11–21 , the Lamb and his companions will conquer them . - 17:16–18 The ten horns : the ten pagan kings ( Rev 17:12 ) who unwittingly fulfill God ’ s will against harlot Rome , the great city ; cf .

NABRE	Revelation	18	17	In one hour this great wealth has been ruined. ” Every captain of a ship , every traveler at sea , sailors , and seafaring merchants stood at a distance
NABRE	Revelation	18	19	( J ) They threw dust on their heads and cried out , weeping and mourning : “ Alas , alas , great city , in which all who had ships at sea grew rich from her wealth . In one hour she has been ruined .
NABRE	Revelation	18	20	Rejoice over her , heaven , you holy ones , apostles , and prophets . For God has judged your case against her. ” ( K )
NABRE	Revelation	18	21	A mighty angel picked up a stone like a huge millstone and threw it into the sea and said : “ With such force will Babylon the great city be thrown down , and will never be found again . ( L )
