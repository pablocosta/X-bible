DARBY	Genesis	1	1	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	1	2	And the earth was waste and empty , and darkness was on the face of the deep , and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters .
DARBY	Genesis	1	3	And God said , Let there be light . And there was light .
DARBY	Genesis	1	4	And God saw the light that it was good ; and God divided between the light and the darkness .
DARBY	Genesis	1	5	And God called the light Day , and the darkness he called Night . And there was evening , and there was morning—the first day .
DARBY	Genesis	1	6	And God said , Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters , and let it be a division between waters and waters .
DARBY	Genesis	1	7	And God made the expanse , and divided between the waters that are under the expanse and the waters that are above the expanse ; and it was so .
DARBY	Genesis	1	8	And God called the expanse Heavens . And there was evening , and there was morning—a second day .
DARBY	Genesis	1	9	And God said , Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place , and let the dry [ land ] appear . And it was so .
DARBY	Genesis	1	10	And God called the dry [ land ] Earth , and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas . And God saw that it was good .
DARBY	Genesis	1	11	And God said , Let the earth cause grass to spring up , herb producing seed , fruit-trees yielding fruit after their kind , the seed of which is in them , on the earth . And it was so .
DARBY	Genesis	1	12	And the earth brought forth grass , herb producing seed after its kind , and trees yielding fruit , the seed of which is in them , after their kind . And God saw that it was good .
DARBY	Genesis	1	13	And there was evening , and there was morning—a third day .
DARBY	Genesis	1	14	And God said , Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens , to divide between the day and the night ; and let them be for signs , and for seasons , and for days and years ;
DARBY	Genesis	1	15	and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens , to give light on the earth . And it was so .
DARBY	Genesis	1	16	And God made the two great lights , the great light to rule the day , and the small light to rule the night , —and the stars .
DARBY	Genesis	1	17	And God set them in the expanse of the heavens , to give light on the earth ,
DARBY	Genesis	1	18	and to rule during the day and during the night , and to divide between the light and the darkness . And God saw that it was good .
DARBY	Genesis	1	19	And there was evening , and there was morning—a fourth day .
DARBY	Genesis	1	20	And God said , Let the waters swarm with swarms of living souls , and let fowl fly above the earth in the expanse of the heavens .
DARBY	Genesis	1	21	And God created the great sea monsters , and every living soul that moves with which the waters swarm , after their kind , and every winged fowl after its kind . And God saw that it was good .
DARBY	Genesis	1	22	And God blessed them , saying , Be fruitful and multiply , and fill the waters in the seas , and let fowl multiply on the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	1	23	And there was evening , and there was morning—a fifth day .
DARBY	Genesis	1	24	And God said , Let the earth bring forth living souls after their kind , cattle , and creeping thing , and beast of the earth , after their kind . And it was so .
DARBY	Genesis	1	25	And God made the beast of the earth after its kind , and the cattle after their kind , and every creeping thing of the ground after its kind . And God saw that it was good .
DARBY	Genesis	1	26	And God said , Let us make man in our image , after our likeness ; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the heavens , and over the cattle , and over the whole earth , and over every creeping thing that creepeth on the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	1	27	And God created Man in his image , in the image of God created he him ; male and female created he them .
DARBY	Genesis	1	28	And God blessed them ; and God said to them , Be fruitful and multiply , and fill the earth , and subdue it ; and have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the heavens , and over every animal that moveth on the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	1	29	And God said , Behold , I have given you every herb producing seed that is on the whole earth , and every tree in which is the fruit of a tree producing seed : it shall be food for you ;
DARBY	Genesis	1	30	and to every animal of the earth , and to every fowl of the heavens , and to everything that creepeth on the earth , in which is a living soul , every green herb for food . And it was so .
DARBY	Genesis	1	31	And God saw everything that he had made , and behold it was very good . And there was evening , and there was morning—the sixth day .
DARBY	Genesis	2	2	And God had finished on the seventh day his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
DARBY	Genesis	2	3	And God blessed the seventh day , and hallowed it , because that on it he rested from all his work which God had created in making it .
DARBY	Genesis	2	4	These are the histories of the heavens and the earth , when they were created , in the day that Jehovah Elohim made earth and heavens ,
DARBY	Genesis	2	5	and every shrub of the field before it was in the earth , and every herb of the field before it grew ; for Jehovah Elohim had not caused it to rain on the earth , and there was no man to till the ground .
DARBY	Genesis	2	6	But a mist went up from the earth , and moistened the whole surface of the ground .
DARBY	Genesis	2	7	And Jehovah Elohim formed Man , dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and Man became a living soul .
DARBY	Genesis	2	8	And Jehovah Elohim planted a garden in Eden eastward , and there put Man whom he had formed .
DARBY	Genesis	2	9	And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight , and good for food ; and the tree of life , in the midst of the garden , and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil .
DARBY	Genesis	2	10	And a river went out of Eden , to water the garden ; and from thence it was parted , and became four main streams .
DARBY	Genesis	2	11	The name of the one is Pison : that is it which surrounds the whole land of Havilah , where the gold is .
DARBY	Genesis	2	12	And the gold of that land is good ; bdellium and the onyx stone are there .
DARBY	Genesis	2	13	And the name of the second river is Gihon : that is it which surrounds the whole land of Cush .
DARBY	Genesis	2	14	And the name of the third river is Hiddekel : that is it which flows forward toward Asshur . And the fourth river , that is Euphrates .
DARBY	Genesis	2	15	And Jehovah Elohim took Man , and put him into the garden of Eden , to till it and to guard it .
DARBY	Genesis	2	16	And Jehovah Elohim commanded Man , saying , Of every tree of the garden thou shalt freely eat ;
DARBY	Genesis	2	17	but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it ; for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt certainly die .
DARBY	Genesis	2	18	And Jehovah Elohim said , It is not good that Man should be alone ; I will make him a helpmate , his like .
DARBY	Genesis	2	19	And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim had formed every animal of the field and all fowl of the heavens , and brought [ them ] to Man , to see what he would call them ; and whatever Man called each living soul , that was its name .
DARBY	Genesis	2	20	And Man gave names to all cattle , and to the fowl of the heavens , and to every beast of the field ; but as for Adam , he found no helpmate , his like .
DARBY	Genesis	2	21	And Jehovah Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon Man ; and he slept . And he took one of his ribs and closed up flesh in its stead .
DARBY	Genesis	2	22	And Jehovah Elohim built the rib that he had taken from Man into a woman ; and brought her to Man .
DARBY	Genesis	2	23	And Man said , This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh : this shall be called Woman , because this was taken out of a man .
DARBY	Genesis	2	24	Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and cleave to his wife ; and they shall become one flesh .
DARBY	Genesis	2	25	And they were both naked , Man and his wife , and were not ashamed .
DARBY	Genesis	3	3	but of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden , God has said , Ye shall not eat of it , and ye shall not touch it , lest ye die .
DARBY	Genesis	3	2	And the woman said to the serpent , We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden ;
DARBY	Genesis	3	4	And the serpent said to the woman , Ye will not certainly die ;
DARBY	Genesis	3	5	but God knows that in the day ye eat of it , your eyes will be opened , and ye will be as God , knowing good and evil .
DARBY	Genesis	3	6	And the woman saw that the tree was good for food , and that it was a pleasure for the eyes , and the tree was to be desired to give intelligence ; and she took of its fruit , and ate , and gave also to her husband with her , and he ate .
DARBY	Genesis	3	7	And the eyes of them both were opened , and they knew that they were naked . And they sewed fig-leaves together , and made themselves aprons .
DARBY	Genesis	3	8	And they heard the voice of Jehovah Elohim , walking in the garden in the cool of the day . And Man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah Elohim , in the midst of the trees of the garden .
DARBY	Genesis	3	9	And Jehovah Elohim called to Man , and said to him , Where art thou ?
DARBY	Genesis	3	10	And he said , I heard thy voice in the garden , and I feared , because I am naked ; and I hid myself .
DARBY	Genesis	3	11	And he said , Who told thee that thou art naked ? Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee not to eat ?
DARBY	Genesis	3	12	And Man said , The woman , whom thou hast given [ to be ] with me , she gave me of the tree , and I ate .
DARBY	Genesis	3	13	And Jehovah Elohim said to the woman , What is this thou hast done ? And the woman said , The serpent deceived me , and I ate .
DARBY	Genesis	3	14	And Jehovah Elohim said to the serpent , Because thou hast done this , be thou cursed above all cattle , and above every beast of the field . On thy belly shalt thou go , and eat dust all the days of thy life .
DARBY	Genesis	3	15	And I will put enmity between thee and the woman , and between thy seed and her seed ; he shall crush thy head , and thou shalt crush his heel .
DARBY	Genesis	3	16	To the woman he said , I will greatly increase thy travail and thy pregnancy ; with pain thou shalt bear children ; and to thy husband shall be thy desire , and he shall rule over thee .
DARBY	Genesis	3	17	And to Adam he said , Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife , and eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying , Thou shalt not eat of it : cursed be the ground on thy account ; with toil shalt thou eat [ of ] it all the days of thy life ;
DARBY	Genesis	3	18	and thorns and thistles shall it yield thee ; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field .
DARBY	Genesis	3	19	In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , until thou return to the ground : for out of it wast thou taken . For dust thou art ; and unto dust shalt thou return .
DARBY	Genesis	3	20	And Man called his wife 's name Eve ; because she is the mother of all living .
DARBY	Genesis	3	21	And Jehovah Elohim made Adam and his wife coats of skin , and clothed them .
DARBY	Genesis	3	22	And Jehovah Elohim said , Behold , Man is become as one of us , to know good and evil . And now , lest he stretch out his hand , and take also of the tree of life , and eat , and live for ever … !
DARBY	Genesis	3	23	Therefore Jehovah Elohim sent him forth from the garden of Eden , to till the ground from which he was taken .
DARBY	Genesis	3	24	And he drove out Man ; and he set the Cherubim , and the flame of the flashing sword , toward the east of the garden of Eden , to guard the way to the tree of life .
DARBY	Genesis	4	4	And Abel , he also brought of the firstlings of his flock , and of their fat . And Jehovah looked upon Abel , and on his offering ;
DARBY	Genesis	4	2	And she further bore his brother Abel . And Abel was a shepherd , but Cain was a husbandman .
DARBY	Genesis	4	3	And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to Jehovah .
DARBY	Genesis	4	5	and upon Cain , and on his offering , he did not look . And Cain was very angry , and his countenance fell .
DARBY	Genesis	4	6	And Jehovah said to Cain , Why art thou angry , and why is thy countenance fallen ?
DARBY	Genesis	4	7	If thou doest well , will not [ thy countenance ] look up [ with confidence ] ? and if thou doest not well , sin lieth at the door ; and unto thee [ shall be ] his desire , and thou shalt rule over him .
DARBY	Genesis	4	8	And Cain spoke to Abel his brother , and it came to pass when they were in the field , that Cain rose up against Abel his brother , and slew him .
DARBY	Genesis	4	9	And Jehovah said to Cain , Where is Abel thy brother ? And he said , I know not : am I my brother 's keeper ?
DARBY	Genesis	4	10	And he said , What hast thou done ? the voice of thy brother 's blood is crying to me from the ground .
DARBY	Genesis	4	11	And now be thou cursed from the ground , which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother 's blood from thy hand .
DARBY	Genesis	4	12	When thou tillest the ground , it shall not henceforth yield thee its strength ; a wanderer and fugitive shalt thou be on the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	4	13	And Cain said to Jehovah , My punishment is too great to be borne .
DARBY	Genesis	4	14	Behold , thou hast driven me this day from the face of the ground , and from thy face shall I be hid ; and I shall be a wanderer and fugitive on the earth ; and it will come to pass , [ that ] every one who finds me will slay me .
DARBY	Genesis	4	15	And Jehovah said to him , Therefore , whoever slayeth Cain , it shall be revenged sevenfold . And Jehovah set a mark on Cain , lest any finding him should smite him .
DARBY	Genesis	4	16	And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah , and dwelt in the land of Nod , toward the east of Eden .
DARBY	Genesis	4	17	And Cain knew his wife , and she conceived and bore Enoch . And he built a city ; and he called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch .
DARBY	Genesis	4	18	And to Enoch was born Irad ; and Irad begot Mehujael ; and Mehujael begot Methushael ; and Methushael begot Lemech .
DARBY	Genesis	4	19	And Lemech took two wives : the name of the one was Adah , and the name of the second , Zillah .
DARBY	Genesis	4	20	And Adah bore Jabal : he was the father of those who dwell in tents , and [ breed ] cattle .
DARBY	Genesis	4	21	And his brother 's name was Jubal : he was the father of those who handle the harp and pipe .
DARBY	Genesis	4	22	And Zillah , she also bore Tubal-Cain , the forger of every kind of tool of brass and iron . And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah .
DARBY	Genesis	4	23	And Lemech said to his wives : Adah and Zillah , hear my voice , Ye wives of Lemech , listen to my speech . For I have slain a man for my wound , and a youth for my bruise .
DARBY	Genesis	4	24	If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold ; Lemech seventy and seven fold .
DARBY	Genesis	4	25	And Adam knew his wife again , and she bore a son , and called his name Seth : … For God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel , because Cain has slain him .
DARBY	Genesis	4	26	And to Seth , to him also was born a son ; and he called his name Enosh . Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah .
DARBY	Genesis	5	5	And all the days of Adam that he lived were nine hundred and thirty years ; and he died .
DARBY	Genesis	5	2	Male and female created he them ; and blessed them , and called their name Adam , in the day when they were created .
DARBY	Genesis	5	3	And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years , and begot [ a son ] in his likeness , after his image , and called his name Seth .
DARBY	Genesis	5	4	And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years ; and he begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	5	6	And Seth lived a hundred and five years , and begot Enosh .
DARBY	Genesis	5	7	And Seth lived after he had begotten Enosh eight hundred and seven years , and begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	5	8	And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years ; and he died .
DARBY	Genesis	5	9	And Enosh lived ninety years , and begot Cainan .
DARBY	Genesis	5	10	And Enosh lived after he had begotten Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years , and begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	5	11	And all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years ; and he died .
DARBY	Genesis	5	12	And Cainan lived seventy years , and begot Mahalaleel .
DARBY	Genesis	5	13	And Cainan lived after he had begotten Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years , and begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	5	14	And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years ; and he died .
DARBY	Genesis	5	15	And Mahalaleel lived sixty-five years , and begot Jared .
DARBY	Genesis	5	16	And Mahalaleel lived after he had begotten Jared eight hundred and thirty years , and begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	5	17	And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred and ninety-five years ; and he died .
DARBY	Genesis	5	18	And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two years , and begot Enoch .
DARBY	Genesis	5	19	And Jared lived after he had begotten Enoch eight hundred years , and begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	5	20	And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years ; and he died .
DARBY	Genesis	5	21	And Enoch lived sixty-five years , and begot Methushelah .
DARBY	Genesis	5	22	And Enoch walked with God after he had begotten Methushelah three hundred years , and begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	5	23	And all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years .
DARBY	Genesis	5	24	And Enoch walked with God ; and he was not , for God took him .
DARBY	Genesis	5	25	And Methushelah lived a hundred and eighty-seven years , and begot Lemech .
DARBY	Genesis	5	26	And Methushelah lived after he had begotten Lemech seven hundred and eighty-two years , and begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	5	27	And all the days of Methushelah were nine hundred and sixty-nine years ; and he died .
DARBY	Genesis	5	28	And Lemech lived a hundred and eighty-two years , and begot a son .
DARBY	Genesis	5	29	And he called his name Noah , saying , This [ one ] shall comfort us concerning our work and concerning the toil of our hands , because of the ground which Jehovah has cursed .
DARBY	Genesis	5	30	And Lemech lived after he had begotten Noah five hundred and ninety-five years , and begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	5	31	And all the days of Lemech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years ; and he died .
DARBY	Genesis	5	32	And Noah was five hundred years old , and Noah begot Shem , Ham , and Japheth .
DARBY	Genesis	6	6	And Jehovah repented that he had made Man on the earth , and it grieved him in his heart .
DARBY	Genesis	6	2	that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair , and took themselves wives of all that they chose .
DARBY	Genesis	6	3	And Jehovah said , My Spirit shall not always plead with Man ; for he indeed is flesh ; but his days shall be a hundred and twenty years .
DARBY	Genesis	6	4	In those days were the giants on the earth , and also afterwards , when the sons of God had come in to the daughters of men , and they had borne [ children ] to them ; these were the heroes , who of old were men of renown .
DARBY	Genesis	6	5	And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of Man was great on the earth , and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart only evil continually .
DARBY	Genesis	6	7	And Jehovah said , I will destroy Man , whom I have created , from the earth—from man to cattle , to creeping things , and to fowl of the heavens ; for I repent that I have made them .
DARBY	Genesis	6	8	But Noah found favour in the eyes of Jehovah .
DARBY	Genesis	6	9	This is the history of Noah . Noah was a just man , perfect amongst his generations : Noah walked with God .
DARBY	Genesis	6	10	And Noah begot three sons , Shem , Ham , and Japheth .
DARBY	Genesis	6	11	And the earth was corrupt before God , and the earth was full of violence .
DARBY	Genesis	6	12	And God looked upon the earth , and behold , it was corrupt ; for all flesh had corrupted its way on the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	6	13	And God said to Noah , The end of all flesh is come before me , for the earth is full of violence through them ; and behold , I will destroy them with the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	6	14	Make thyself an ark of gopher wood : [ with ] cells shalt thou make the ark ; and pitch it inside and outside with pitch .
DARBY	Genesis	6	15	And thus shalt thou make it : let the length of the ark be three hundred cubits , the breadth of it fifty cubits , and the height of it thirty cubits .
DARBY	Genesis	6	16	A light shalt thou make to the ark ; and to a cubit high shalt thou finish it above . And the door of the ark shalt thou set in its side : [ with ] a lower , second , and third [ story ] shalt thou make it .
DARBY	Genesis	6	17	For I , behold , I bring a flood of waters on the earth , to destroy all flesh under the heavens in which is the breath of life : everything that is on the earth shall expire .
DARBY	Genesis	6	18	But with thee will I establish my covenant ; and thou shalt go into the ark , thou , and thy sons , and thy wife , and thy sons ' wives with thee .
DARBY	Genesis	6	19	And of every living thing of all flesh , two of every [ sort ] shalt thou bring into the ark , to keep [ them ] alive with thee : they shall be male and female .
DARBY	Genesis	6	20	Of fowl after their kind , and of the cattle after their kind , of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind , two of each shall go in to thee , to keep [ them ] alive .
DARBY	Genesis	6	21	And take thou of all food that is eaten , and gather [ it ] to thee , that it may be for food for thee and for them .
DARBY	Genesis	6	22	And Noah did it ; according to all that God had commanded him , so did he .
DARBY	Genesis	7	7	And Noah went in , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wives with him , into the ark , because of the waters of the flood .
DARBY	Genesis	7	2	Of all clean beasts thou shalt take to thee by sevens , a male and its female ; but of the beasts that are not clean two , a male and its female .
DARBY	Genesis	7	3	Also of the fowl of the heavens by sevens , male and female ; to keep seed alive on the face of all the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	7	4	For in yet seven days I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days and forty nights ; and every living being which I have made will I destroy from the ground .
DARBY	Genesis	7	5	And Noah did according to all that Jehovah had commanded him .
DARBY	Genesis	7	6	And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was on the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	7	8	Of clean beasts , and of beasts that are not clean , and of fowl , and of everything that creeps on the ground ,
DARBY	Genesis	7	9	there came two and two unto Noah into the ark , male and female , as God had commanded Noah .
DARBY	Genesis	7	10	And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were on the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	7	11	In the six hundredth year of Noah 's life , in the second month , on the seventeenth day of the month , on that same day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened .
DARBY	Genesis	7	12	And the pour of rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights .
DARBY	Genesis	7	13	On the same day went Noah , and Shem and Ham and Japheth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , into the ark ;
DARBY	Genesis	7	14	they , and every beast after its kind , and all the cattle after their kind , and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind , and all fowl after its kind—every bird of every wing .
DARBY	Genesis	7	15	And they went to Noah , into the ark , two and two of all flesh , in which was the breath of life .
DARBY	Genesis	7	16	And they that came , came male and female of all flesh , as God had commanded him . And Jehovah shut him in .
DARBY	Genesis	7	17	And the flood was forty days on the earth . And the waters increased , and bore up the ark ; and it was lifted up above the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	7	18	And the waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth ; and the ark went on the face of the waters .
DARBY	Genesis	7	19	And the waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth ; and all the high mountains that are under all the heavens were covered .
DARBY	Genesis	7	20	Fifteen cubits upward the waters prevailed ; and the mountains were covered .
DARBY	Genesis	7	21	And all flesh that moved on the earth expired , fowl as well as cattle , and beasts , and all crawling things which crawl on the earth , and all mankind :
DARBY	Genesis	7	22	everything which had in its nostrils the breath of life , of all that was on the dry [ land ] , died .
DARBY	Genesis	7	23	And every living being was destroyed that was on the ground , both man , and cattle , and creeping things , and fowl of the heavens ; and they were destroyed from the earth . And Noah alone remained , and what was with him in the ark .
DARBY	Genesis	7	24	And the waters prevailed on the earth a hundred and fifty days .
DARBY	Genesis	8	8	And he sent out the dove from him , to see if the waters had become low on the ground .
DARBY	Genesis	8	2	And the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were closed , and the pour of rain from heaven was stopped .
DARBY	Genesis	8	3	And the waters retired from the earth , continually retiring ; and in the course of a hundred and fifty days the waters abated .
DARBY	Genesis	8	4	And the ark rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , on the mountains of Ararat .
DARBY	Genesis	8	5	And the waters abated continually until the tenth month : in the tenth [ month ] , on the first of the month , the tops of the mountains were seen .
DARBY	Genesis	8	6	And it came to pass at the end of forty days that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made .
DARBY	Genesis	8	7	And he sent out the raven , which went forth going to and fro , until the waters were dried from the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	8	9	But the dove found no resting-place for the sole of her foot , and returned to him into the ark ; for the waters were on the whole earth ; and he put forth his hand , and took her , and brought her to him into the ark .
DARBY	Genesis	8	10	And he waited yet other seven days , and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark .
DARBY	Genesis	8	11	And the dove came to him at eventide ; and behold , in her beak was an olive-leaf plucked off ; and Noah knew that the waters had become low on the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	8	12	And he waited yet other seven days , and sent forth the dove ; but she returned no more to him .
DARBY	Genesis	8	13	And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year , in the first [ month ] , on the first of the month , that the waters were dried up from the earth . And Noah removed the covering of the ark , and looked , and behold , the surface of the ground was dried .
DARBY	Genesis	8	14	And in the second month , on the twenty-seventh day of the month , the earth was dry .
DARBY	Genesis	8	15	And God spoke to Noah , saying ,
DARBY	Genesis	8	16	Go out of the ark , thou , and thy wife , and thy sons , and thy sons ' wives with thee .
DARBY	Genesis	8	17	Bring forth with thee every animal which is with thee , of all flesh , fowl as well as cattle , and all the creeping things which creep on the earth , that they may swarm on the earth , and may be fruitful and multiply on the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	8	18	And Noah went out , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wives with him .
DARBY	Genesis	8	19	All the animals , all the creeping things , and all the fowl—everything that moves on the earth , after their kinds , went out of the ark .
DARBY	Genesis	8	20	And Noah built an altar to Jehovah ; and took of every clean animal , and of all clean fowl , and offered up burnt-offerings on the altar .
DARBY	Genesis	8	21	And Jehovah smelled the sweet odour . And Jehovah said in his heart , I will no more henceforth curse the ground on account of Man , for the thought of Man 's heart is evil from his youth ; and I will no more smite every living thing , as I have done .
DARBY	Genesis	8	22	Henceforth , all the days of the earth , seed [ time ] and harvest , and cold and heat , and summer and winter , and day and night , shall not cease .
DARBY	Genesis	9	9	And I , behold , I establish my covenant with you , and with your seed after you ;
DARBY	Genesis	9	2	And let the fear of you and the dread of you be upon every animal of the earth , and upon all fowl of the heavens : upon all that moveth [ on ] the ground ; and upon all the fishes of the sea : into your hand are they delivered .
DARBY	Genesis	9	3	Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you : as the green herb I give you everything .
DARBY	Genesis	9	4	Only , the flesh with its life , its blood , ye shall not eat .
DARBY	Genesis	9	5	And indeed your blood , [ the blood ] of your lives , will I require : at the hand of every animal will I require it , and at the hand of Man , at the hand of each [ the blood ] of his brother , will I require the life of Man .
DARBY	Genesis	9	6	Whoso sheddeth Man 's blood , by Man shall his blood be shed ; for in the image of God he hath made Man .
DARBY	Genesis	9	7	And ye , be fruitful and multiply : swarm on the earth , and multiply on it .
DARBY	Genesis	9	8	And God spoke to Noah , and to his sons with him , saying ,
DARBY	Genesis	9	10	and with every living soul which is with you , fowl as well as cattle , and all the animals of the earth with you , of all that has gone out of the ark—every animal of the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	9	11	And I establish my covenant with you , neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood , and henceforth there shall be no flood to destroy the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	9	12	And God said , This is the sign of the covenant that I set between me and you and every living soul that is with you , for everlasting generations :
DARBY	Genesis	9	13	I set my bow in the clouds , and it shall be for a sign of the covenant between me and the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	9	14	And it shall come to pass when I bring clouds over the earth , that the bow shall be seen in the cloud ,
DARBY	Genesis	9	15	and I will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living soul of all flesh ; and the waters shall not henceforth become a flood to destroy all flesh .
DARBY	Genesis	9	16	And the bow shall be in the cloud ; and I will look upon it , that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living soul of all flesh that is upon the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	9	17	And God said to Noah , This is the sign of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	9	18	And the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem , and Ham , and Japheth . And Ham is the father of Canaan .
DARBY	Genesis	9	19	These three are the sons of Noah ; and from these was [ the population of ] the whole earth spread abroad .
DARBY	Genesis	9	20	And Noah began [ to be ] a husbandman , and planted a vineyard .
DARBY	Genesis	9	21	And he drank of the wine , and was drunken , and he uncovered himself in his tent .
DARBY	Genesis	9	22	And Ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father , and told his two brethren outside .
DARBY	Genesis	9	23	And Shem and Japheth took the upper garment and both laid [ it ] upon their shoulders , and went backwards , and covered the nakedness of their father . And their faces were turned away , that they saw not their father 's nakedness .
DARBY	Genesis	9	24	And Noah awoke from his wine , and learned what his youngest son had done to him .
DARBY	Genesis	9	25	And he said , Cursed be Canaan ; Let him be a bondman of bondmen to his brethren .
DARBY	Genesis	9	26	And he said , Blessed be Jehovah , the God of Shem , And let Canaan be his bondman .
DARBY	Genesis	9	27	Let God enlarge Japheth , and let him dwell in the tents of Shem , And let Canaan be his bondman .
DARBY	Genesis	9	28	And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years .
DARBY	Genesis	9	29	And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years ; and he died .
DARBY	Genesis	10	10	And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel , and Erech , and Accad , and Calneh , in the land of Shinar .
DARBY	Genesis	10	2	The sons of Japheth : Gomer , and Magog , and Madai , and Javan , and Tubal , and Meshech , and Tiras .
DARBY	Genesis	10	3	And the sons of Gomer : Ashkenaz , and Riphath , and Togarmah .
DARBY	Genesis	10	4	And the sons of Javan : Elishah , and Tarshish , Kittim , and Dodanim .
DARBY	Genesis	10	5	From these came the distribution of the isles of the nations , according to their lands , every one after his tongue , after their families , in their nations .
DARBY	Genesis	10	6	And the sons of Ham : Cush , and Mizraim , and Phut , and Canaan .
DARBY	Genesis	10	7	And the sons of Cush : Seba , and Havilah , and Sabtah , and Raamah , and Sabtecha . And the sons of Raamah : Sheba and Dedan .
DARBY	Genesis	10	8	And Cush begot Nimrod : he began to be mighty on the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	10	9	He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah ; therefore it is said , As Nimrod , the mighty hunter before Jehovah !
DARBY	Genesis	10	11	From that land went out Asshur , and built Nineveh , and Rehoboth-Ir , and Calah ,
DARBY	Genesis	10	12	and Resen , between Nineveh and Calah : this is the great city .
DARBY	Genesis	10	13	—And Mizraim begot the Ludim , and the Anamim , and the Lehabim , and the Naphtuhim ,
DARBY	Genesis	10	14	and the Pathrusim , and the Casluhim , out of whom came the Philistines , and the Caphtorim .
DARBY	Genesis	10	15	—And Canaan begot Sidon , his firstborn , and Heth ,
DARBY	Genesis	10	16	and the Jebusite , and the Amorite , and the Girgashite ,
DARBY	Genesis	10	17	and the Hivite , and the Arkite , and the Sinite ,
DARBY	Genesis	10	18	and the Arvadite , and the Zemarite , and the Hamathite . And afterwards the families of the Canaanites spread themselves abroad .
DARBY	Genesis	10	19	And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon , as one goes to Gerar , up to Gazah ; as one goes to Sodom , and Gomorrah , and Admah , and Zeboim , up to Lesha .
DARBY	Genesis	10	20	These are the sons of Ham , after their families , after their tongues , in their lands , in their nations .
DARBY	Genesis	10	21	And to Shem—to him also were [ sons ] born ; he is the father of all the sons of Eber , the brother of Japheth the elder .
DARBY	Genesis	10	22	The sons of Shem : Elam , and Asshur , and Arphaxad , and Lud , and Aram .
DARBY	Genesis	10	23	And the sons of Aram : Uz , and Hul , and Gether , and Mash .
DARBY	Genesis	10	24	—And Arphaxad begot Shelah ; and Shelah begot Eber .
DARBY	Genesis	10	25	And to Eber were born two sons : the name of the one was Peleg , for in his days was the earth divided ; and his brother 's name was Joktan .
DARBY	Genesis	10	26	And Joktan begot Almodad , and Sheleph , and Hazarmaveth , and Jerah ,
DARBY	Genesis	10	27	and Hadoram , and Uzal , and Diklah ,
DARBY	Genesis	10	28	and Obal , and Abimael , and Sheba ,
DARBY	Genesis	10	29	and Ophir , and Havilah , and Jobab : all these were sons of Joktan .
DARBY	Genesis	10	30	And their dwelling was from Mesha , as one goes to Sephar , the eastern mountain .
DARBY	Genesis	10	31	These are the sons of Shem , after their families , after their tongues , in their lands , after their nations .
DARBY	Genesis	10	32	These are the families of the sons of Noah , after their generations , in their nations . And from these came the distribution of the nations on the earth after the flood .
DARBY	Genesis	11	11	And Shem lived after he had begotten Arphaxad five hundred years , and begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	11	2	And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east , that they found a plain in the land of Shinar , and dwelt there .
DARBY	Genesis	11	3	And they said one to another , Come on , let us make bricks , and burn [ them ] thoroughly . And they had brick for stone , and they had asphalt for mortar .
DARBY	Genesis	11	4	And they said , Come on , let us build ourselves a city and a tower , the top of which [ may reach ] to the heavens ; and let us make ourselves a name , lest we be scattered over the face of the whole earth .
DARBY	Genesis	11	5	And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men built .
DARBY	Genesis	11	6	And Jehovah said , Behold , the people is one , and have all one language ; and this have they begun to do . And now will they be hindered in nothing that they meditate doing .
DARBY	Genesis	11	7	Come , let us go down , and there confound their language , that they may not understand one another 's speech .
DARBY	Genesis	11	8	And Jehovah scattered them thence over the face of the whole earth . And they left off building the city .
DARBY	Genesis	11	9	Therefore was its name called Babel ; because Jehovah there confounded the language of the whole earth . And Jehovah scattered them thence over the face of the whole earth .
DARBY	Genesis	11	10	These are the generations of Shem . Shem was a hundred years old , and begot Arphaxad two years after the flood .
DARBY	Genesis	11	12	And Arphaxad lived thirty-five years , and begot Shelah .
DARBY	Genesis	11	13	And Arphaxad lived after he had begotten Shelah four hundred and three years , and begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	11	14	And Shelah lived thirty years , and begot Eber .
DARBY	Genesis	11	15	And Shelah lived after he had begotten Eber four hundred and three years , and begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	11	16	And Eber lived thirty-four years , and begot Peleg .
DARBY	Genesis	11	17	And Eber lived after he had begotten Peleg four hundred and thirty years , and begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	11	18	And Peleg lived thirty years , and begot Reu .
DARBY	Genesis	11	19	And Peleg lived after he had begotten Reu two hundred and nine years , and begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	11	20	And Reu lived thirty-two years , and begot Serug .
DARBY	Genesis	11	21	And Reu lived after he had begotten Serug two hundred and seven years , and begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	11	22	And Serug lived thirty years , and begot Nahor .
DARBY	Genesis	11	23	And Serug lived after he had begotten Nahor two hundred years , and begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	11	24	And Nahor lived twenty-nine years , and begot Terah .
DARBY	Genesis	11	25	And Nahor lived after he had begotten Terah a hundred and nineteen years , and begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	11	26	And Terah lived seventy years , and begot Abram , Nahor , and Haran .
DARBY	Genesis	11	27	And these are the generations of Terah : Terah begot Abram , Nahor , and Haran ; and Haran begot Lot .
DARBY	Genesis	11	28	And Haran died before the face of his father Terah in the land of his nativity at Ur of the Chaldeans .
DARBY	Genesis	11	29	And Abram and Nahor took wives : the name of Abram 's wife was Sarai ; and the name of Nahor 's wife , Milcah , a daughter of Haran , the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah .
DARBY	Genesis	11	30	And Sarai was barren : she had no child .
DARBY	Genesis	11	31	And Terah took Abram his son , and Lot the son of Haran his son 's son , and Sarai his daughter-in-law , his son Abram 's wife ; and they went forth together out of Ur of the Chaldeans , to go into the land of Canaan , and came as far as Haran , and dwelt there .
DARBY	Genesis	11	32	And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years ; and Terah died in Haran .
DARBY	Genesis	12	12	And it will come to pass when the Egyptians see thee , that they will say , She is his wife ; and they will slay me , and save thee alive .
DARBY	Genesis	12	2	And I will make of thee a great nation , and bless thee , and make thy name great ; and thou shalt be a blessing .
DARBY	Genesis	12	3	And I will bless them that bless thee , and curse him that curseth thee ; and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed .
DARBY	Genesis	12	4	And Abram departed as Jehovah had said to him . And Lot went with him . And Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran .
DARBY	Genesis	12	5	And Abram took Sarai his wife , and Lot his brother 's son , and all their possessions that they had acquired , and the souls that they had obtained in Haran , and they went out to go into the land of Canaan ; and into the land of Canaan they came .
DARBY	Genesis	12	6	And Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem , to the oak of Moreh . And the Canaanite was then in the land .
DARBY	Genesis	12	7	And Jehovah appeared to Abram , and said , Unto thy seed will I give this land . And there he built an altar to Jehovah who had appeared to him .
DARBY	Genesis	12	8	And he removed thence towards the mountain on the east of Bethel , and pitched his tent , [ having ] Bethel toward the west , and Ai toward the east ; and there he built an altar to Jehovah , and called on the name of Jehovah .
DARBY	Genesis	12	9	And Abram moved onward , going on still toward the south .
DARBY	Genesis	12	10	And there was a famine in the land . And Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there , for the famine was grievous in the land .
DARBY	Genesis	12	11	And it came to pass when he was come near to enter into Egypt , that he said to Sarai his wife , Behold now , I know that thou art a woman fair to look upon .
DARBY	Genesis	12	13	Say , I pray thee , thou art my sister , that it may be well with me on thy account , and my soul may live because of thee .
DARBY	Genesis	12	14	And it came to pass when Abram came into Egypt , that the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair .
DARBY	Genesis	12	15	And the princes of Pharaoh saw her , and praised her to Pharaoh ; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh 's house .
DARBY	Genesis	12	16	And he treated Abram well on her account ; and he had sheep , and oxen , and he-asses , and bondmen , and bondwomen , and she-asses , and camels .
DARBY	Genesis	12	17	And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram 's wife .
DARBY	Genesis	12	18	And Pharaoh called Abram , and said , What is this thou hast done to me ? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife ?
DARBY	Genesis	12	19	Why didst thou say , She is my sister , so that I took her as my wife . And now , behold , there is thy wife : take [ her ] , and go away .
DARBY	Genesis	12	20	And Pharaoh commanded [ his ] men concerning him , and they sent him away , and his wife , and all that he had .
DARBY	Genesis	13	13	And the people of Sodom were wicked , and great sinners before Jehovah .
DARBY	Genesis	13	2	And Abram was very rich in cattle , in silver , and in gold .
DARBY	Genesis	13	3	And he went on his journeys from the south as far as Bethel ; as far as the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between Bethel and Ai ;
DARBY	Genesis	13	4	to the place of the altar that he had made there at the first . And there Abram called on the name of Jehovah .
DARBY	Genesis	13	5	And Lot also who went with Abram had flocks , and herds , and tents .
DARBY	Genesis	13	6	And the land could not support them , that they might dwell together , for their property was great ; and they could not dwell together .
DARBY	Genesis	13	7	And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram 's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot 's cattle . And the Canaanite and the Perizzite were dwelling then in the land .
DARBY	Genesis	13	8	And Abram said to Lot , I pray thee let there be no contention between me and thee , and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen , for we are brethren .
DARBY	Genesis	13	9	Is not the whole land before thee ? Separate thyself , I pray thee , from me : if to the left , then I will take the right ; and if to the right , then I will take the left .
DARBY	Genesis	13	10	And Lot lifted up his eyes , and beheld all the plain of the Jordan that it was thoroughly watered , before Jehovah had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah ; as the garden of Jehovah , like the land of Egypt , as one goes to Zoar .
DARBY	Genesis	13	11	And Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan ; and Lot went toward the east . And they separated the one from the other :
DARBY	Genesis	13	12	Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan ; and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain , and pitched tents as far as Sodom .
DARBY	Genesis	13	14	And Jehovah said to Abram , after that Lot had separated himself from him , Lift up now thine eyes , and look from the place where thou art , northward and southward and eastward and westward ;
DARBY	Genesis	13	15	for all the land that thou seest will I give to thee , and to thy seed for ever .
DARBY	Genesis	13	16	And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth , so that if any one can number the dust of the earth , thy seed also will be numbered .
DARBY	Genesis	13	17	Arise , walk through the land according to the length of it and according to the breadth of it ; for I will give it to thee .
DARBY	Genesis	13	18	Then Abram moved [ his ] tents , and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre , which are in Hebron . And he built there an altar to Jehovah .
DARBY	Genesis	14	14	And Abram heard that his brother was taken captive ; and he led out his trained [ servants ] , born in his house , three hundred and eighteen , and pursued [ them ] as far as Dan .
DARBY	Genesis	14	2	[ that ] they made war with Bera the king of Sodom , and with Birsha the king of Gomorrah , Shinab the king of Admah , and Shemeber the king of Zeboim , and the king of Bela , which is Zoar .
DARBY	Genesis	14	3	All these were joined in the vale of Siddim , which is the salt sea .
DARBY	Genesis	14	4	Twelve years had they served Chedorlaomer ; and in the thirteenth year they rebelled .
DARBY	Genesis	14	5	And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him , and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim , and the Zuzim in Ham , and the Emim in Shaveh-Kirjathaim ,
DARBY	Genesis	14	6	and the Horites on their mount Seir , to El-Paran , which is by the wilderness .
DARBY	Genesis	14	7	And they returned , and came to En-mishpat , which is Kadesh , and smote all the country of the Amalekites , and also the Amorites that dwelt at Hazazon-Tamar .
DARBY	Genesis	14	8	And the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah , and the king of Admah , and the king of Zeboim , and the king of Bela , which is Zoar , went out , and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim ,
DARBY	Genesis	14	9	with Chedorlaomer the king of Elam , and Tidal the king of nations , and Amraphel the king of Shinar , and Arioch the king of Ellasar—four kings with the five .
DARBY	Genesis	14	10	And the vale of Siddim was full of pits of asphalt . And the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled , and fell there : and they that remained fled to the mountain .
DARBY	Genesis	14	11	And they took all the property of Sodom and Gomorrah , and all their victuals , and departed .
DARBY	Genesis	14	12	And they took Lot and his property , Abram 's brother 's son , and departed . For he dwelt in Sodom .
DARBY	Genesis	14	13	And one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew . And he dwelt by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite , the brother of Eshcol , and the brother of Aner . And these were Abram 's allies .
DARBY	Genesis	14	15	And he divided himself against them by night , he and his servants , and smote them , and pursued them as far as Hobah , which is to the left of Damascus .
DARBY	Genesis	14	16	And he brought back all the property , and brought again his brother Lot and his property , and the women also , and the people .
DARBY	Genesis	14	17	And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after he had returned from smiting Chedorlaomer , and the kings that were with him , into the valley of Shaveh , which is the king 's valley .
DARBY	Genesis	14	18	And Melchisedec king of Salem brought out bread and wine . And he was priest of the Most High God .
DARBY	Genesis	14	19	And he blessed him , and said , Blessed be Abram of the Most High God , possessor of heavens and earth .
DARBY	Genesis	14	20	And blessed be the Most High God , who has delivered thine enemies into thy hand . And he gave him the tenth of all .
DARBY	Genesis	14	21	And the king of Sodom said to Abram , Give me the souls , and take the property for thyself .
DARBY	Genesis	14	22	And Abram said to the king of Sodom , I have lifted up my hand to Jehovah , the Most High God , possessor of heavens and earth ,
DARBY	Genesis	14	23	if from a thread even to a sandal-thong , yes , if of all that is thine , I take [ anything ] … ; that thou mayest not say , I have made Abram rich ;
DARBY	Genesis	14	24	save only that which the young men have eaten , and the portion of the men that went with me , Aner , Eshcol , and Mamre , let them take their portion .
DARBY	Genesis	15	15	And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace ; thou shalt be buried in a good old age .
DARBY	Genesis	15	2	And Abram said , Lord Jehovah , what wilt thou give me ? seeing I go childless , and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus .
DARBY	Genesis	15	3	And Abram said , Lo , to me thou hast given no seed , and behold , a son of my house will be mine heir .
DARBY	Genesis	15	4	And behold , the word of Jehovah [ came ] to him , saying , This shall not be thine heir , but he that will come forth out of thy body shall be thine heir .
DARBY	Genesis	15	5	And he led him out , and said , Look now toward the heavens , and number the stars , if thou be able to number them . And he said to him , So shall thy seed be !
DARBY	Genesis	15	6	And he believed Jehovah ; and he reckoned it to him [ as ] righteousness .
DARBY	Genesis	15	7	And he said to him , I am Jehovah who brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldeans , to give thee this land to possess it .
DARBY	Genesis	15	8	And he said , Lord Jehovah , how shall I know that I shall possess it ?
DARBY	Genesis	15	9	And he said to him , Take me a heifer of three years old , and a she-goat of three years old , and a ram of three years old , and a turtle-dove , and a young pigeon .
DARBY	Genesis	15	10	And he took all these , and divided them in the midst , and laid the half of each opposite its fellow ; but the birds he did not divide .
DARBY	Genesis	15	11	And the birds of prey came down on the carcases ; and Abram scared them away .
DARBY	Genesis	15	12	And as the sun was just going down , a deep sleep fell upon Abram ; and behold , a horror , a great darkness , fell upon him .
DARBY	Genesis	15	13	And he said to Abram , Know assuredly that thy seed will be a sojourner in a land [ that is ] not theirs , and they shall serve them ; and they shall afflict them four hundred years .
DARBY	Genesis	15	14	But also that nation which they shall serve I will judge ; and afterwards they shall come out with great property .
DARBY	Genesis	15	16	And [ in the ] fourth generation they shall come hither again ; for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full .
DARBY	Genesis	15	17	And it came to pass when the sun had gone down , and it was dark , that behold , there was a smoking furnace , and a flame of fire which passed between those pieces .
DARBY	Genesis	15	18	On the same day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram , saying , Unto thy seed I give this land , from the river of Egypt to the great river , the river Euphrates ;
DARBY	Genesis	15	19	the Kenites , and the Kenizzites , and the Kadmonites ,
DARBY	Genesis	15	20	and the Hittites , and the Perizzites , and the Rephaim ,
DARBY	Genesis	15	21	and the Amorites , and the Canaanites , and the Girgashites , and the Jebusites .
DARBY	Genesis	16	16	And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram .
DARBY	Genesis	16	2	And Sarai said to Abram , Behold now , Jehovah has shut me up , that I do not bear . Go in , I pray thee , to my maidservant : it may be that I shall be built up by her . And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai .
DARBY	Genesis	16	3	And Sarai Abram 's wife took Hagar , the Egyptian , her maidservant , at the end of ten years that Abram had dwelt in the land of Canaan , and gave her to her husband Abram , as his wife .
DARBY	Genesis	16	4	And he went in to Hagar , and she conceived . And when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress was lightly esteemed in her eyes .
DARBY	Genesis	16	5	And Sarai said to Abram , My wrong be on thee ! I have given my maidservant into thy bosom ; and now she sees that she has conceived , I am lightly esteemed in her eyes . Jehovah judge between me and thee !
DARBY	Genesis	16	6	And Abram said to Sarai , Behold , thy maidservant is in thy hand : do to her what is good in thine eyes . And Sarai oppressed her ; and she fled from her face .
DARBY	Genesis	16	7	And the Angel of Jehovah found her by a spring of water in the wilderness , by the spring on the way to Shur .
DARBY	Genesis	16	8	And he said , Hagar , Sarai 's maidservant , whence comest thou ? and whither art thou going ? And she said , I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai .
DARBY	Genesis	16	9	And the Angel of Jehovah said to her , Return to thy mistress , and submit thyself under her hands .
DARBY	Genesis	16	10	And the Angel of Jehovah said to her , I will multiply thy seed exceedingly , that it shall not be numbered for multitude .
DARBY	Genesis	16	11	And the Angel of Jehovah said to her , Behold , thou art with child , and shalt bear a son , and shalt call his name Ishmael , because Jehovah hath hearkened to thy affliction .
DARBY	Genesis	16	12	And he will be a wild-ass of a man , his hand against every man , and every man 's hand against him ; and he shall dwell before the face of all his brethren .
DARBY	Genesis	16	13	And she called the name of Jehovah who spoke to her , Thou art the God who reveals himself , for she said , Also here have I seen after he has revealed himself .
DARBY	Genesis	16	14	Therefore the well was named Beer-lahai-roi : behold , it is between Kadesh and Bered .
DARBY	Genesis	16	15	And Hagar bore Abram a son ; and Abram called the name of his son whom Hagar bore , Ishmael .
DARBY	Genesis	17	17	And Abraham fell on his face and laughed , and said in his heart , Shall [ a child ] be born to him that is a hundred years old ? and shall Sarah , who is ninety years old , bear ?
DARBY	Genesis	17	2	And I will set my covenant between me and thee , and will very greatly multiply thee .
DARBY	Genesis	17	3	And Abram fell on his face ; and God talked with him , saying ,
DARBY	Genesis	17	4	It is I : behold , my covenant is with thee , and thou shalt be a father of a multitude of nations .
DARBY	Genesis	17	5	And thy name shall no more be called Abram , but thy name shall be Abraham ; for a father of a multitude of nations have I made thee .
DARBY	Genesis	17	6	And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful , and I will make nations of thee , and kings shall come out of thee .
DARBY	Genesis	17	7	And I will establish my covenant between me and thee , and thy seed after thee in their generations , for an everlasting covenant , to be a God to thee , and to thy seed after thee .
DARBY	Genesis	17	8	And I give to thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land of thy sojourning , all the land of Canaan , for an everlasting possession ; and I will be a God to them .
DARBY	Genesis	17	9	And God said to Abraham , And [ as for ] thee , thou shalt keep my covenant , thou and thy seed after thee in their generations .
DARBY	Genesis	17	10	This is my covenant which ye shall keep , between me and you and thy seed after thee—that every male among you be circumcised .
DARBY	Genesis	17	11	And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin ; and [ that ] shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you .
DARBY	Genesis	17	12	And at eight days old shall every male in your generations be circumcised among you—he who is born in the house , and he who is bought with money , any stranger who is not of thy seed .
DARBY	Genesis	17	13	He who is born in thy house , and he who is bought with thy money , must be circumcised ; and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant .
DARBY	Genesis	17	14	And the uncircumcised male who hath not been circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin , that soul shall be cut off from his peoples : he hath broken my covenant .
DARBY	Genesis	17	15	And God said to Abraham , [ As to ] Sarai thy wife , thou shalt not call her name Sarai , but Sarah shall be her name .
DARBY	Genesis	17	16	And I will bless her , and I will give thee a son also of her ; and I will bless her , and she shall become nations : kings of peoples shall be of her .
DARBY	Genesis	17	18	And Abraham said to God , Oh that Ishmael might live before thee !
DARBY	Genesis	17	19	And God said , Sarah thy wife shall indeed bear thee a son ; and thou shalt call his name Isaac ; and I will establish my covenant with him , for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him .
DARBY	Genesis	17	20	And for Ishmael I have heard thee : behold , I will bless him , and will make him fruitful , and will very greatly multiply him ; twelve princes shall he beget , and I will make him a great nation .
DARBY	Genesis	17	21	But my covenant will I establish with Isaac , whom Sarah shall bear to thee at this appointed time in the next year .
DARBY	Genesis	17	22	And he left off talking with him ; and God went up from Abraham .
DARBY	Genesis	17	23	And Abraham took Ishmael his son , and all who were born in his house , and all who were bought with his money—every male among the people of Abraham 's house—and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on that same day , as God had said to him .
DARBY	Genesis	17	24	And Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
DARBY	Genesis	17	25	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
DARBY	Genesis	17	26	In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised , and Ishmael his son ;
DARBY	Genesis	17	27	and all the men of his house , born in his house , or bought with money of the stranger , were circumcised with him .
DARBY	Genesis	18	18	Since Abraham shall indeed become a great and mighty nation ; and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him .
DARBY	Genesis	18	2	And he lifted up his eyes and saw , and behold , three men standing near him . And when he saw [ them ] , he ran to meet them from the tent-door , and bowed himself to the earth ,
DARBY	Genesis	18	3	and said , Lord , if now I have found favour in thine eyes , pass not away , I pray thee , from thy servant .
DARBY	Genesis	18	4	Let now a little water be fetched , that ye may wash your feet , and rest yourselves under the tree .
DARBY	Genesis	18	5	And I will fetch a morsel of bread ; and refresh yourselves ; after that ye shall pass on ; for therefore have ye passed on towards your servant . And they said , So do as thou hast said .
DARBY	Genesis	18	6	And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah , and said , Knead quickly three seahs of wheaten flour , and make cakes .
DARBY	Genesis	18	7	And Abraham ran to the herd , and took a calf tender and good , and gave [ it ] to the attendant ; and he hasted to dress it .
DARBY	Genesis	18	8	And he took thick and sweet milk , and the calf that he had dressed , and set [ it ] before them ; and he stood before them under the tree , and they ate .
DARBY	Genesis	18	9	And they said to him , Where is Sarah thy wife ? And he said , Behold , in the tent .
DARBY	Genesis	18	10	And he said , I will certainly return to thee at [ this ] time of the year , and behold , Sarah thy wife shall have a son . And Sarah was listening at the tent-door , which was behind him .
DARBY	Genesis	18	11	Now Abraham and Sarah were old [ and ] advanced in age : it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women .
DARBY	Genesis	18	12	And Sarah laughed within herself , saying , After I am become old , shall I have pleasure , and my lord old ?
DARBY	Genesis	18	13	And Jehovah said to Abraham , Why is this , that Sarah laughs , saying , Shall I indeed bear , when I am become old ?
DARBY	Genesis	18	14	Is [ any ] matter too wonderful for Jehovah ? At the time appointed I will return to thee , at [ this ] time of the year , and Sarah shall have a son .
DARBY	Genesis	18	15	And Sarah denied , saying , I did not laugh ; for she was afraid . And he said , No ; but thou didst laugh .
DARBY	Genesis	18	16	And the men rose up thence , and looked toward Sodom ; and Abraham went with them to conduct them .
DARBY	Genesis	18	17	And Jehovah said , Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing ?
DARBY	Genesis	18	19	For I know him that he will command his children and his household after him , and they shall keep the way of Jehovah , to do righteousness and justice , in order that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham what he hath spoken of him .
DARBY	Genesis	18	20	And Jehovah said , Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grievous ,
DARBY	Genesis	18	21	I will go down now , and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it , which is come to me ; and if not , I will know [ it ] .
DARBY	Genesis	18	22	And the men turned thence , and went towards Sodom ; and Abraham remained yet standing before Jehovah .
DARBY	Genesis	18	23	And Abraham drew near , and said , Wilt thou also cause the righteous to perish with the wicked ?
DARBY	Genesis	18	24	There are perhaps fifty righteous within the city : wilt thou also destroy and not forgive the place for the sake of the fifty righteous that are therein ?
DARBY	Genesis	18	25	Far be it from thee to do so , to slay the righteous with the wicked , that the righteous should be as the wicked—far be it from thee ! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right ?
DARBY	Genesis	18	26	And Jehovah said , If I find at Sodom fifty righteous within the city , then I will forgive all the place for their sakes .
DARBY	Genesis	18	27	And Abraham answered and said , Behold now , I have ventured to speak unto the Lord ; I , who am dust and ashes .
DARBY	Genesis	18	28	Perhaps there may want five of the fifty righteous : wilt thou destroy all the city on account of the five ? And he said , If I shall find forty-five there , I will not destroy [ it ] .
DARBY	Genesis	18	29	And he continued yet to speak with him , and said , Perhaps there may be forty found there . And he said , I will not do it for the forty 's sake .
DARBY	Genesis	18	30	And he said , Oh , let not the Lord be angry that I speak ! Perhaps there may be thirty found there . And he said , I will not do it if I find thirty there .
DARBY	Genesis	18	31	And he said , Behold now , I have ventured to speak with the Lord . Perhaps there may be twenty found there . And he said , I will not destroy [ it ] for the twenty 's sake .
DARBY	Genesis	18	32	And he said , Oh , let not the Lord be angry , that I speak yet but this time ! Perhaps there may be ten found there . And he said , I will not destroy [ it ] for the ten 's sake .
DARBY	Genesis	18	33	And Jehovah went away when he had ended speaking to Abraham ; and Abraham returned to his place .
DARBY	Genesis	19	19	behold now , thy servant has found favour in thine eyes , and thou hast magnified thy goodness , which thou hast shewn to me in preserving my soul alive ; but I can not escape to the mountain , lest calamity lay hold on me , that I die .
DARBY	Genesis	19	2	and he said , Behold now , my lords , turn in , I pray you , into your servant 's house , and lodge , and wash your feet ; and ye shall rise up early , and go on your way . And they said , No ; but we will pass the night in the open place .
DARBY	Genesis	19	3	And he urged them greatly ; and they turned in unto him , and entered into his house . And he made them a repast , and baked unleavened cakes ; and they ate .
DARBY	Genesis	19	4	Before they lay down , the men of the city , the men of Sodom , surrounded the house , from the youngest to the oldest—all the people from every quarter .
DARBY	Genesis	19	5	And they called to Lot , and said to him , Where are the men that have come in to thee to-night ? bring them out to us that we may know them .
DARBY	Genesis	19	6	And Lot went out to them to the entrance , and shut the door after him ,
DARBY	Genesis	19	7	and said , I pray you , my brethren , do not wickedly !
DARBY	Genesis	19	8	Behold now , I have two daughters who have not known a man : let me now bring them out to you ; and do to them as is good in your sight : only , to these men do nothing ; for therefore have they come under the shadow of my roof .
DARBY	Genesis	19	9	And they said , Back there ! And they said [ again ] , This one came to sojourn , and he must be a judge ? Now we will deal worse with thee than with them . And they pressed hard on the man—on Lot ; and drew near to break the door .
DARBY	Genesis	19	10	And the men stretched out their hand , and brought Lot into the house to them , and shut the door .
DARBY	Genesis	19	11	And they smote the men that were at the entrance of the house with blindness , from the smallest to the greatest ; and they wearied themselves to find the entrance .
DARBY	Genesis	19	12	And the men said to Lot , Whom hast thou here besides ? a son-in-law , and thy sons , and thy daughters , and all whom thou hast in the city—bring [ them ] out of the place .
DARBY	Genesis	19	13	For we are going to destroy this place , because the cry of them is great before Jehovah , and Jehovah has sent us to destroy it .
DARBY	Genesis	19	14	And Lot went out , and spoke to his sons-in-law , who had married his daughters , and said , Up , go out of this place , for Jehovah will destroy the city . But he was as if he jested , in the sight of his sons-in-law .
DARBY	Genesis	19	15	And as the dawn arose , the angels urged Lot , saying , Up , take thy wife and thy two daughters who are present , lest thou perish in the iniquity of the city .
DARBY	Genesis	19	16	And as he lingered , the men laid hold on his hand , and on the hand of his wife , and on the hand of his two daughters , Jehovah being merciful to him ; and they led him out , and set him without the city .
DARBY	Genesis	19	17	And it came to pass when they had brought them outside , that he said , Escape for thy life : look not behind thee , neither stay thou in all the plain : escape to the mountain , lest thou perish .
DARBY	Genesis	19	18	And Lot said to them , Not [ so ] , I pray thee , Lord ;
DARBY	Genesis	19	20	Behold now , this city is near to flee to , and it is small : I pray thee , let me escape thither—is it not small ? —and my soul shall live .
DARBY	Genesis	19	21	And he said to him , Behold , I have accepted thee concerning this thing also , that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken .
DARBY	Genesis	19	22	Haste , escape thither ; for I can not do anything until thou art come there . Therefore the name of the city is called Zoar .
DARBY	Genesis	19	23	The sun rose upon the earth when Lot came to Zoar .
DARBY	Genesis	19	24	And Jehovah rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven ,
DARBY	Genesis	19	25	and overthrew those cities , and all the plain , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and what grew upon the ground .
DARBY	Genesis	19	26	And his wife looked back from behind him , and she became a pillar of salt .
DARBY	Genesis	19	27	And Abraham rose early in the morning [ and went ] to the place where he had stood before Jehovah ;
DARBY	Genesis	19	28	and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , and lo , a smoke went up from the land as the smoke of a furnace .
DARBY	Genesis	19	29	And it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt .
DARBY	Genesis	19	30	And Lot went up from Zoar , and dwelt in the mountain , and his two daughters with him ; for he feared to dwell in Zoar . And he dwelt in a cave , he and his two daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	19	31	And the first-born said to the younger , Our father is old , and there is not a man in the land to come in to us after the manner of all the earth :
DARBY	Genesis	19	32	come , let us give our father wine to drink , and let us lie with him , that we may preserve seed alive of our father .
DARBY	Genesis	19	33	And they gave their father wine to drink that night . And the first-born went in , and lay with her father , and he did not know of her lying down , nor of her rising .
DARBY	Genesis	19	34	And it came to pass on the next day that the first-born said to the younger , Lo , I lay last night with my father : let us give him wine to drink to-night also , and go thou in , lie with him , that we may preserve seed alive of our father .
DARBY	Genesis	19	35	And they gave their father wine to drink that night also . And the younger arose , and lay with him ; and he did not know of her lying down , nor of her rising .
DARBY	Genesis	19	36	And both the daughters of Lot were with child by their father .
DARBY	Genesis	19	37	And the first-born bore a son , and called his name Moab : the same is the father of the Moabites to this day .
DARBY	Genesis	19	38	And the younger , she also bore a son , and called his name Ben-ammi ; the same is the father of the children of Ammon to this day .
DARBY	Genesis	20	20	And Abraham departed thence towards the south country , and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur , and sojourned at Gerar .
DARBY	Genesis	20	2	And Abraham said of Sarah his wife , She is my sister . And Abimelech the king of Gerar sent and took Sarah .
DARBY	Genesis	20	3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night , and said to him , Behold , thou art [ but ] a dead man , because of the woman that thou hast taken ; for she is a man 's wife .
DARBY	Genesis	20	4	But Abimelech had not come near her . And he said , Lord , wilt thou also kill a righteous nation ?
DARBY	Genesis	20	5	Did he not say to me , She is my sister ? and she , even she said , He is my brother . In the integrity of my heart and in the innocency of my hands have I done this .
DARBY	Genesis	20	6	And God said to him in a dream , I also knew that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart , and I , too , have withheld thee from sinning against me : therefore have I not suffered thee to touch her .
DARBY	Genesis	20	7	And now , restore the man 's wife ; for he is a prophet , and will pray for thee , that thou mayest live . And if thou do not restore [ her ] , know that thou shalt certainly die , thou and all that is thine .
DARBY	Genesis	20	8	And Abimelech rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and spoke all these words in their ears ; and the men were greatly afraid .
DARBY	Genesis	20	9	And Abimelech called Abraham and said to him , What hast thou done to us ? And in what have I sinned against thee , that thou hast brought on me , and on my kingdom , a great sin ? Thou hast done to me deeds that ought not to be done .
DARBY	Genesis	20	10	And Abimelech said to Abraham , What hast thou seen that thou hast done this ?
DARBY	Genesis	20	11	And Abraham said , Because I said , Surely the fear of God is not in this place , and they will kill me for my wife 's sake .
DARBY	Genesis	20	12	But she is also truly my sister , the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
DARBY	Genesis	20	13	And it came to pass when God caused me to wander from my father 's house , that I said to her , Let this be thy kindness which thou shalt shew to me : at every place whither we shall come , say of me , He is my brother .
DARBY	Genesis	20	14	And Abimelech took sheep and oxen , and bondmen and bondwomen , and gave [ them ] to Abraham , and restored him Sarah his wife .
DARBY	Genesis	20	15	And Abimelech said , Behold , my land is before thee : dwell where it is good in thine eyes .
DARBY	Genesis	20	16	And to Sarah he said , Behold , I have given thy brother a thousand [ pieces ] of silver ; behold , let that be to thee a covering of the eyes , in respect of all that are with thee , and with all ; and she was reproved .
DARBY	Genesis	20	17	And Abraham prayed to God , and God healed Abimelech , and his wife and his handmaids , and they bore [ children ] .
DARBY	Genesis	20	18	For Jehovah had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah Abraham 's wife .
DARBY	Genesis	21	21	And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran . And his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Genesis	21	2	And Sarah conceived , and bore Abraham a son in his old age , at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him .
DARBY	Genesis	21	3	And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him , whom Sarah bore to him , Isaac .
DARBY	Genesis	21	4	And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac , being eight days old , as God had commanded him .
DARBY	Genesis	21	5	And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him .
DARBY	Genesis	21	6	And Sarah said , God has made me laugh : all that hear will laugh with me .
DARBY	Genesis	21	7	And she said , Who would have said to Abraham , Sarah will suckle children ? For I have borne [ him ] a son in his old age .
DARBY	Genesis	21	8	And the child grew , and was weaned . And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned .
DARBY	Genesis	21	9	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian , whom she had borne to Abraham , mocking .
DARBY	Genesis	21	10	And she said to Abraham , Cast out this handmaid and her son ; for the son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son—with Isaac .
DARBY	Genesis	21	11	And the thing was very grievous in Abraham 's sight because of his son .
DARBY	Genesis	21	12	And God said to Abraham , Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy handmaid : [ in ] all that Sarah hath said to thee hearken to her voice , for in Isaac shall a seed be called to thee .
DARBY	Genesis	21	13	But also the son of the handmaid will I make a nation , because he is thy seed .
DARBY	Genesis	21	14	And Abraham rose up early in the morning , and took bread , and a flask of water , and gave [ it ] to Hagar , putting [ it ] on her shoulder—and the child , and sent her away . And she departed , and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba .
DARBY	Genesis	21	15	And the water was exhausted from the flask ; and she cast the child under one of the shrubs ,
DARBY	Genesis	21	16	and she went and sat down over against [ him ] , a bow-shot off ; for she said , Let me not behold the death of the child . And she sat over against [ him ] , and lifted up her voice and wept .
DARBY	Genesis	21	17	And God heard the voice of the lad . And the Angel of God called to Hagar from the heavens , and said to her , What [ aileth ] thee , Hagar ? Fear not ; for God hath heard the voice of the lad there , where he is .
DARBY	Genesis	21	18	Arise , take the lad , and hold him in thy hand ; for I will make of him a great nation .
DARBY	Genesis	21	19	And God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water ; and she went and filled the flask with water , and gave the lad drink .
DARBY	Genesis	21	20	And God was with the lad , and he grew ; and he dwelt in the wilderness , and became an archer .
DARBY	Genesis	21	22	And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech , and Phichol the captain of his host , spoke to Abraham , saying , God is with thee in all that thou doest .
DARBY	Genesis	21	23	And now swear to me here by God that thou wilt not deal deceitfully with me , nor with my son , nor with my grandson . According to the kindness that I have done to thee , thou shalt do to me , and to the land in which thou sojournest .
DARBY	Genesis	21	24	And Abraham said , I will swear .
DARBY	Genesis	21	25	And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water that Abimelech 's servants had violently taken away .
DARBY	Genesis	21	26	And Abimelech said , I do not know who has done this , neither hast thou told me [ of it ] , neither have I heard [ of it ] but to-day .
DARBY	Genesis	21	27	And Abraham took sheep and oxen , and gave them to Abimelech ; and both of them made a covenant .
DARBY	Genesis	21	28	And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves .
DARBY	Genesis	21	29	And Abimelech said to Abraham , What [ mean ] these seven ewe-lambs , these which thou hast set by themselves ?
DARBY	Genesis	21	30	And he said , That thou take the seven ewe-lambs of my hand , that they may be a witness to me that I have dug this well .
DARBY	Genesis	21	31	Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba , because there they had sworn , both of them .
DARBY	Genesis	21	32	And they made a covenant at Beer-sheba . And Abimelech rose up , and Phichol the captain of his host , and returned into the land of the Philistines .
DARBY	Genesis	21	33	And [ Abraham ] planted a tamarisk in Beer-sheba , and called there on the name of Jehovah , the Eternal God .
DARBY	Genesis	21	34	And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines ' land many days .
DARBY	Genesis	22	22	and Chesed , and Hazo , and Pildash , and Jidlaph , and Bethuel .
DARBY	Genesis	22	2	And he said , Take now thy son , thine only [ son ] , whom thou lovest , Isaac , and get thee into the land of Moriah , and there offer him up for a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will tell thee of .
DARBY	Genesis	22	3	And Abraham rose early in the morning , and saddled his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son ; and he clave the wood for the burnt-offering , and rose up and went to the place that God had told him of .
DARBY	Genesis	22	4	On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar .
DARBY	Genesis	22	5	And Abraham said to his young men , Abide ye here with the ass ; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship , and come again to you .
DARBY	Genesis	22	6	And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering , and laid it on Isaac his son ; and he took the fire in his hand , and the knife , and they went both of them together .
DARBY	Genesis	22	7	And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father , and said , My father ! And he said , Here am I , my son . And he said , Behold the fire and the wood ; but where is the sheep for a burnt-offering ?
DARBY	Genesis	22	8	And Abraham said , My son , God will provide himself with the sheep for a burnt-offering . And they went both of them together .
DARBY	Genesis	22	9	And they came to the place of which God had told him . And Abraham built the altar there , and piled the wood ; and he bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
DARBY	Genesis	22	10	And Abraham stretched out his hand , and took the knife to slaughter his son .
DARBY	Genesis	22	11	And the Angel of Jehovah called to him from the heavens , and said , Abraham , Abraham ! And he said , Here am I .
DARBY	Genesis	22	12	And he said , Stretch not out thy hand against the lad , neither do anything to him ; for now I know that thou fearest God , and hast not withheld thy son , thine only [ son ] , from me .
DARBY	Genesis	22	13	And Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold , behind was a ram caught in the thicket by its horns ; and Abraham went and took the ram , and offered it up for a burnt-offering instead of his son .
DARBY	Genesis	22	14	And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh ; as it is said at the present day , On the mount of Jehovah will be provided .
DARBY	Genesis	22	15	And the Angel of Jehovah called to Abraham from the heavens a second time ,
DARBY	Genesis	22	16	and said , By myself I swear , saith Jehovah , that , because thou hast done this , and hast not withheld thy son , thine only [ son ] ,
DARBY	Genesis	22	17	I will richly bless thee , and greatly multiply thy seed , as the stars of heaven , and as the sand that is on the sea-shore ; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies ;
DARBY	Genesis	22	18	and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves , because thou hast hearkened to my voice .
DARBY	Genesis	22	19	And Abraham returned to his young men , and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba . And Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba .
DARBY	Genesis	22	20	And it came to pass after these things , that it was told Abraham , saying , Behold , Milcah , she also has borne sons to thy brother Nahor :
DARBY	Genesis	22	21	Uz his first-born , and Buz his brother , and Kemuel the father of Aram ,
DARBY	Genesis	22	23	( And Bethuel begot Rebecca . ) These eight Milcah bore to Nahor , Abraham 's brother .
DARBY	Genesis	22	24	And his concubine , named Reumah , she also bore Tebah , and Gaham , and Thahash , and Maacah .
DARBY	Genesis	23	23	And the life of Sarah was a hundred and twenty-seven years : [ these were ] the years of the life of Sarah .
DARBY	Genesis	23	2	And Sarah died in Kirjath-Arba : that is Hebron , in the land of Canaan . And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah , and to weep for her .
DARBY	Genesis	23	3	And Abraham rose up from before his dead , and spoke to the sons of Heth , saying ,
DARBY	Genesis	23	4	I am a stranger and a sojourner with you ; give me a possession of a sepulchre with you , that I may bury my dead from before me .
DARBY	Genesis	23	5	And the sons of Heth answered Abraham , saying to him ,
DARBY	Genesis	23	6	Hear us , my lord : thou art a prince of God among us : in the choicest of our sepulchres bury thy dead : none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre for burying thy dead .
DARBY	Genesis	23	7	And Abraham rose up , and bowed down to the people of the land , to the sons of Heth ,
DARBY	Genesis	23	8	and spoke to them , saying , If it be your will that I should bury my dead from before me , hear me , and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar ,
DARBY	Genesis	23	9	that he may give me the cave of Machpelah , which is his , which is at the end of his field ; for the full money let him give it to me amongst you for a possession of a sepulchre .
DARBY	Genesis	23	10	And Ephron was dwelling among the sons of Heth . And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham , in the ears of the sons of Heth , [ even ] of all that went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
DARBY	Genesis	23	11	No , my lord : hear me . The field give I thee ; and the cave that is in it , to thee I give it ; before the eyes of the sons of my people give I it thee : bury thy dead .
DARBY	Genesis	23	12	And Abraham bowed down before the people of the land ;
DARBY	Genesis	23	13	and he spoke to Ephron , in the ears of the people of the land , saying , But if only thou wouldst listen to me , I give the money for the field : take [ it ] of me , and I will bury my dead there .
DARBY	Genesis	23	14	And Ephron answered Abraham , saying to him ,
DARBY	Genesis	23	15	My lord , hearken to me . A field of four hundred shekels of silver , what is that between me and thee ? bury therefore thy dead .
DARBY	Genesis	23	16	And Abraham hearkened to Ephron ; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the money that he had named in the ears of the sons of Heth—four hundred shekels of silver , current with the merchant .
DARBY	Genesis	23	17	So the field of Ephron , which was at Machpelah , which was before Mamre , the field , and the cave that was in it , and all the trees that were in the field , that were in all its borders round about ,
DARBY	Genesis	23	18	were assured to Abraham for a possession before the eyes of the sons of Heth , before all who went in at the gate of his city .
DARBY	Genesis	23	19	And after this , Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field at Machpelah , opposite to Mamre : that is Hebron , in the land of Canaan .
DARBY	Genesis	23	20	And the field and the cave that was in it were assured to Abraham for a possession of a sepulchre by the sons of Heth .
DARBY	Genesis	24	24	And she said to him , I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah , whom she bore to Nahor .
DARBY	Genesis	24	2	And Abraham said to his servant , the eldest of his house , who ruled over all that he had , Put thy hand , I pray thee , under my thigh ,
DARBY	Genesis	24	3	and I will make thee swear by Jehovah , the God of the heavens and the God of the earth , that thou take not a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , among whom I am dwelling ;
DARBY	Genesis	24	4	but thou shalt go to my land and to my kindred , and take a wife for my son Isaac .
DARBY	Genesis	24	5	And the servant said to him , Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land : must I , then , bring thy son again in any case to the land from which thou hast removed ?
DARBY	Genesis	24	6	And Abraham said to him , Beware that thou bring not my son thither again .
DARBY	Genesis	24	7	Jehovah the God of the heavens , who took me out of my father 's house , and out of the land of my nativity , and who has spoken to me , and who has sworn to me , saying , Unto thy seed will I give this land—he will send his angel before thee , that thou mayest take a wife for my son thence .
DARBY	Genesis	24	8	And if the woman be not willing to follow thee , then thou shalt be quit of this my oath : only , bring not my son thither again .
DARBY	Genesis	24	9	And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master , and swore unto him concerning that matter .
DARBY	Genesis	24	10	And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master , and departed ; now all the treasure of his master was under his hand ; and he arose and went to Aram-naharaim , to the city of Nahor .
DARBY	Genesis	24	11	And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water , at the time of the evening , when the women came out to draw [ water ] .
DARBY	Genesis	24	12	And he said , Jehovah , God of my master Abraham , meet me , I pray thee , [ with thy blessing ] this day , and deal kindly with my master Abraham .
DARBY	Genesis	24	13	Behold , I stand [ here ] by the well of water , and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water .
DARBY	Genesis	24	14	And let it come to pass , [ that ] the maiden to whom I shall say , Let down thy pitcher , I pray thee , that I may drink , and who will say , Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also , be she whom thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac ; and hereby I shall know that thou hast dealt kindly with my master .
DARBY	Genesis	24	15	And it came to pass before he had ended speaking , that behold , Rebecca came out , who was born to Bethuel , son of Milcah the wife of Nahor , Abraham 's brother ; and [ she had ] her pitcher upon her shoulder .
DARBY	Genesis	24	16	And the maiden was very fair in countenance ; a virgin , and no man had known her . And she went down to the well , and filled her pitcher , and came up .
DARBY	Genesis	24	17	And the servant ran to meet her , and said , Let me , I pray thee , sip a little water out of thy pitcher .
DARBY	Genesis	24	18	And she said , Drink , my lord ! And she hasted and let down her pitcher on her hand , and gave him to drink .
DARBY	Genesis	24	19	And when she had given him enough to drink , she said , I will draw [ water ] for thy camels also , until they have drunk enough .
DARBY	Genesis	24	20	And she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough , and ran again to the well to draw [ water ] ; and she drew for all his camels .
DARBY	Genesis	24	21	And the man was astonished at her , remaining silent , to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not .
DARBY	Genesis	24	22	And it came to pass when the camels had drunk enough , that the man took a gold ring , of half a shekel weight , and two bracelets for her hands , ten [ shekels ] weight of gold ,
DARBY	Genesis	24	23	and said , Whose daughter art thou ? tell me , I pray thee . Is there room [ in ] thy father 's house for us to lodge ?
DARBY	Genesis	24	25	And she said to him , There is straw , and also much provender with us ; also room to lodge .
DARBY	Genesis	24	26	And the man stooped , and bowed down before Jehovah ,
DARBY	Genesis	24	27	and said , Blessed be Jehovah , God of my master Abraham , who has not withdrawn his loving-kindness and his faithfulness from my master ; I being in the way , Jehovah has led me to the house of my master 's brethren .
DARBY	Genesis	24	28	And the maiden ran and told these things to her mother 's house .
DARBY	Genesis	24	29	And Rebecca had a brother , named Laban ; and Laban ran out to the man , to the well .
DARBY	Genesis	24	30	And it came to pass when he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister 's hand , and when he heard the words of Rebecca his sister , saying , Thus spoke the man to me—that he came to the man , and behold , he was standing by the camels , by the well .
DARBY	Genesis	24	31	And he said , Come in , blessed of Jehovah ! why standest thou outside ? for I have prepared the house , and room for the camels .
DARBY	Genesis	24	32	And the man came into the house ; and he ungirded the camels , and gave the camels straw and provender , and water to wash his feet , and the feet of the men who were with him .
DARBY	Genesis	24	33	And there was set [ meat ] before him to eat ; but he said , I will not eat until I have made known my business . And he said , Speak on .
DARBY	Genesis	24	34	And he said , I am Abraham 's servant .
DARBY	Genesis	24	35	And Jehovah has blessed my master greatly , and he is become great ; and he has given him sheep and cattle , and silver and gold , and bondmen and bondwomen , and camels and asses .
DARBY	Genesis	24	36	And Sarah , my master 's wife , bore a son to my master after she had grown old ; and unto him has he given all that he has .
DARBY	Genesis	24	37	And my master made me swear , saying , Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanite , in whose land I am dwelling ;
DARBY	Genesis	24	38	but thou shalt by all means go to my father 's house and to my family , and take a wife for my son .
DARBY	Genesis	24	39	And I said to my master , Perhaps the woman will not follow me ?
DARBY	Genesis	24	40	And he said to me , Jehovah , before whom I have walked , will send his angel with thee , and prosper thy way , that thou mayest take a wife for my son of my family , and out of my father 's house .
DARBY	Genesis	24	41	Then shalt thou be quit of my oath , when thou shalt have come to my family . And if they give thee not [ one ] , thou shalt be quit of my oath .
DARBY	Genesis	24	42	And I came this day to the well , and said , Jehovah , God of my master Abraham , if now thou wilt prosper my way on which I go ,
DARBY	Genesis	24	43	behold , I stand by the well of water , and let it come to pass that the damsel who cometh forth to draw [ water ] , and to whom I shall say , Give me , I pray thee , a little water out of thy pitcher to drink ,
DARBY	Genesis	24	44	and she shall say to me , Both drink thou , and I will also draw for thy camels—that she should be the woman whom Jehovah hath appointed for my master 's son .
DARBY	Genesis	24	45	Before I ended speaking in my heart , behold , Rebecca came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder , and went down to the well , and drew [ water ] ; and I said to her , Give me , I pray thee , to drink .
DARBY	Genesis	24	46	And she hasted and let down her pitcher from her [ shoulder ] , and said , Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also . And I drank ; and she gave the camels drink also .
DARBY	Genesis	24	47	And I asked her , and said , Whose daughter art thou ? And she said , The daughter of Bethuel , Nahor 's son , whom Milcah bore to him . And I put the ring on her nose , and the bracelets on her hands .
DARBY	Genesis	24	48	And I stooped , and bowed down before Jehovah ; and I blessed Jehovah , God of my master Abraham , who has led me the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter for his son .
DARBY	Genesis	24	49	And now , if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me ; and if not , tell me ; and I will turn to the right hand or to the left .
DARBY	Genesis	24	50	And Laban and Bethuel answered and said , The thing proceeds from Jehovah : we can not speak to thee bad or good .
DARBY	Genesis	24	51	Behold , Rebecca is before thee : take [ her ] , and go away ; and let her be wife of thy master 's son , as Jehovah has said .
DARBY	Genesis	24	52	And it came to pass , when Abraham 's servant heard their words , that he bowed down to the earth before Jehovah .
DARBY	Genesis	24	53	And the servant brought forth silver articles , and gold articles , and clothing , and he gave [ them ] to Rebecca ; and he gave to her brother , and to her mother , precious things .
DARBY	Genesis	24	54	And they ate and drank , he and the men that were with him , and lodged . And they rose up in the morning ; and he said , Send me away to my master .
DARBY	Genesis	24	55	And her brother and her mother said , Let the maiden abide with us [ some ] days , or [ say ] ten ; after that she shall go .
DARBY	Genesis	24	56	And he said to them , Do not hinder me , seeing Jehovah has prospered my way : send me away , and I will go to my master .
DARBY	Genesis	24	57	And they said , Let us call the maiden and inquire at her mouth .
DARBY	Genesis	24	58	And they called Rebecca and said to her , Wilt thou go with this man ? And she said , I will go .
DARBY	Genesis	24	59	And they sent away Rebecca their sister , and her nurse , and Abraham 's servant , and his men .
DARBY	Genesis	24	60	And they blessed Rebecca , and said to her , Thou art our sister ; mayest thou become thousands of tens of thousands ; and may thy seed possess the gate of their enemies !
DARBY	Genesis	24	61	And Rebecca arose , and her maids , and they rode upon the camels , and followed the man . And the servant took Rebecca , and went away .
DARBY	Genesis	24	62	And Isaac had just returned from Beer-lahai-roi ; for he was dwelling in the south country .
DARBY	Genesis	24	63	And Isaac had gone out to meditate in the fields toward the beginning of evening . And he lifted up his eyes and saw , and behold , camels were coming .
DARBY	Genesis	24	64	And Rebecca lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac , and she sprang off the camel .
DARBY	Genesis	24	65	And she had said to the servant , Who is the man that is walking in the fields to meet us ? And the servant said , That is my master ! Then she took the veil , and covered herself .
DARBY	Genesis	24	66	And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done .
DARBY	Genesis	24	67	And Isaac led her into his mother Sarah 's tent ; and he took Rebecca , and she became his wife , and he loved her . And Isaac was comforted after [ the death of ] his mother .
DARBY	Genesis	25	25	And the first came out red—all over like a hairy garment ; and they called his name Esau .
DARBY	Genesis	25	2	And she bore him Zimran , and Jokshan , and Medan , and Midian , and Ishbak , and Shuah .
DARBY	Genesis	25	3	And Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan ; and the sons of Dedan were the Asshurim , and the Letushim , and the Leummim .
DARBY	Genesis	25	4	And the sons of Midian were Ephah , and Epher , and Enoch , and Abida , and Eldaah . All these were sons of Keturah .
DARBY	Genesis	25	5	And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac .
DARBY	Genesis	25	6	And to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had , Abraham gave gifts , and , while he yet lived , sent them away from Isaac his son , eastward to the east country .
DARBY	Genesis	25	7	And these are the days of the years of Abraham 's life which he lived : a hundred and seventy-five years .
DARBY	Genesis	25	8	And Abraham expired and died in a good old age , old and full [ of days ] ; and was gathered to his peoples .
DARBY	Genesis	25	9	And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah , in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite , which was opposite to Mamre—
DARBY	Genesis	25	10	the field that Abraham had purchased of the sons of Heth : there was Abraham buried , and Sarah his wife .
DARBY	Genesis	25	11	And it came to pass after the death of Abraham , that God blessed his son Isaac . And Isaac dwelt at Beer-lahai-roi .
DARBY	Genesis	25	12	And these are the generations of Ishmael , Abraham 's son , whom Hagar the Egyptian , Sarah 's bondwoman , bore to Abraham .
DARBY	Genesis	25	13	And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their names according to their generations : Nebaioth , the firstborn of Ishmael ; and Kedar , and Adbeel , and Mibsam ,
DARBY	Genesis	25	14	and Mishma , and Dumah , and Massa ,
DARBY	Genesis	25	15	Hadad and Tema , Jetur , Naphish and Kedmah .
DARBY	Genesis	25	16	These are the sons of Ishmael , and these are their names , in their hamlets and their encampments—twelve princes of their peoples .
DARBY	Genesis	25	17	And these are the years of the life of Ishmael : a hundred and thirty-seven years ; and he expired and died , and was gathered to his peoples .
DARBY	Genesis	25	18	And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur , which is opposite to Egypt , as one goes towards Assyria . He settled before the face of all his brethren .
DARBY	Genesis	25	19	And these are the generations of Isaac , Abraham 's son . Abraham begot Isaac .
DARBY	Genesis	25	20	And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebecca as wife , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-Aram , the sister of Laban the Syrian .
DARBY	Genesis	25	21	And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife , because she was barren ; and Jehovah was entreated of him , and Rebecca his wife conceived .
DARBY	Genesis	25	22	And the children struggled together within her ; and she said , If [ it be ] so , why am I thus ? And she went to inquire of Jehovah .
DARBY	Genesis	25	23	And Jehovah said to her , Two nations are in thy womb , And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels ; And one people shall be stronger than the other people , And the elder shall serve the younger .
DARBY	Genesis	25	24	And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled , behold , there were twins in her womb .
DARBY	Genesis	25	26	And after that came his brother out ; and his hand took hold of Esau 's heel ; and his name was called Jacob . And Isaac was sixty years old when they were born .
DARBY	Genesis	25	27	And the boys grew , and Esau became a man skilled in hunting , a man of the field ; and Jacob was a homely man , dwelling in tents .
DARBY	Genesis	25	28	And Isaac loved Esau , because venison was to his taste ; and Rebecca loved Jacob .
DARBY	Genesis	25	29	And Jacob had cooked a dish ; and Esau came from the field , and he was faint .
DARBY	Genesis	25	30	And Esau said to Jacob , Feed me , I pray thee , with the red—the red thing there , for I am faint . Therefore was his name called Edom .
DARBY	Genesis	25	31	And Jacob said , Sell me now thy birthright .
DARBY	Genesis	25	32	And Esau said , Behold , I am going to die , and of what use can the birthright be to me ?
DARBY	Genesis	25	33	And Jacob said , Swear unto me now . And he swore unto him , and sold his birthright to Jacob .
DARBY	Genesis	25	34	And Jacob gave Esau bread and the dish of lentils ; and he ate and drank , and rose up and went away . Thus Esau despised the birthright .
DARBY	Genesis	26	26	And Abimelech , and Ahuzzath his friend , and Phichol the captain of his host , went to him from Gerar .
DARBY	Genesis	26	2	And Jehovah appeared to him and said , Go not down to Egypt : dwell in the land that I shall tell thee of .
DARBY	Genesis	26	3	Sojourn in this land ; and I will be with thee and bless thee ; for unto thee , and unto thy seed , I will give all these countries ; and I will perform the oath which I swore unto Abraham thy father .
DARBY	Genesis	26	4	And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven , and unto thy seed will I give all these countries ; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves—
DARBY	Genesis	26	5	because that Abraham hearkened to my voice , and kept my charge , my commandments , my statutes , and my laws .
DARBY	Genesis	26	6	And Isaac dwelt at Gerar .
DARBY	Genesis	26	7	And the men of the place asked about his wife . And he said , She is my sister ; for he feared to say , my wife , [ saying to himself , ] Lest the men of the place slay me on account of Rebecca—because she was fair in countenance .
DARBY	Genesis	26	8	And it came to pass when he had been there some time , that Abimelech the king of the Philistines looked out of the window , and saw , and behold , Isaac was dallying with Rebecca his wife .
DARBY	Genesis	26	9	Then Abimelech called Isaac , and said , Behold , she is certainly thy wife ; and how saidst thou , She is my sister ? and Isaac said to him , Because I said , Lest I die on account of her .
DARBY	Genesis	26	10	And Abimelech said , What is this thou hast done to us ? But a little and one of the people might have lain with thy wife , and thou wouldest have brought a trespass on us .
DARBY	Genesis	26	11	And Abimelech charged all the people , saying , He that touches this man or his wife shall certainly be put to death .
DARBY	Genesis	26	12	And Isaac sowed in that land , and received in the same year a hundredfold ; and Jehovah blessed him .
DARBY	Genesis	26	13	And the man became great , and he became continually greater , until he was very great .
DARBY	Genesis	26	14	And he had possessions of flocks , and possessions of herds , and a great number of servants ; and the Philistines envied him .
DARBY	Genesis	26	15	And all the wells that his father 's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father , the Philistines stopped them and filled them with earth .
DARBY	Genesis	26	16	And Abimelech said to Isaac , Go from us ; for thou art become much mightier than we .
DARBY	Genesis	26	17	And Isaac departed thence , and pitched his camp in the valley of Gerar , and dwelt there .
DARBY	Genesis	26	18	And Isaac dug again the wells of water that they had dug in the days of Abraham his father , and that the Philistines had stopped after the death of Abraham ; and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them .
DARBY	Genesis	26	19	And Isaac 's servants dug in the valley , and found there a well of springing water .
DARBY	Genesis	26	20	But the shepherds of Gerar strove with Isaac 's shepherds , saying , The water is ours . And he called the name of the well Esek , because they had quarrelled with him .
DARBY	Genesis	26	21	And they dug another well , and they strove for that also ; and he called the name of it Sitnah .
DARBY	Genesis	26	22	And he removed thence and dug another well ; and they did not strive for that . And he called the name of it Rehoboth , and said , For now Jehovah has made room for us , and we shall be fruitful in the land .
DARBY	Genesis	26	23	And he went up thence to Beer-sheba .
DARBY	Genesis	26	24	And Jehovah appeared to him the same night , and said , I am the God of Abraham thy father : fear not , for I am with thee , and will bless thee , and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham 's sake .
DARBY	Genesis	26	25	And he built an altar there , and called upon the name of Jehovah . And he pitched his tent there ; and there Isaac 's servants dug a well .
DARBY	Genesis	26	27	And Isaac said to them , Why are ye come to me , seeing ye hate me , and have driven me away from you ?
DARBY	Genesis	26	28	And they said , We saw certainly that Jehovah is with thee ; and we said , Let there be then an oath between us—between us and thee , and let us make a covenant with thee ,
DARBY	Genesis	26	29	that thou wilt do us no wrong , as we have not touched thee , and as we have done to thee nothing but good , and have let thee go in peace ; thou art now blessed of Jehovah .
DARBY	Genesis	26	30	And he made them a feast , and they ate and drank .
DARBY	Genesis	26	31	And they rose early in the morning , and swore one to another ; and Isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
DARBY	Genesis	26	32	And it came to pass the same day , that Isaac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well that they had dug , and said to him , We have found water .
DARBY	Genesis	26	33	And he called it Shebah ; therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day .
DARBY	Genesis	26	34	And Esau was forty years old , when he took as wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and Basmath the daughter of Elon the Hittite .
DARBY	Genesis	26	35	And they were a grief of mind to Isaac and to Rebecca .
DARBY	Genesis	27	27	And he came near , and kissed him . And he smelt the smell of his clothes , and blessed him , and said , See , the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed .
DARBY	Genesis	27	2	And he said , Behold now , I am become old ; I know not the day of my death .
DARBY	Genesis	27	3	And now , I pray thee , take thy weapons , thy quiver and thy bow , and go out to the field and hunt me venison ,
DARBY	Genesis	27	4	and prepare me a savoury dish such as I love , and bring it to me that I may eat , in order that my soul may bless thee before I die .
DARBY	Genesis	27	5	And Rebecca heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son . And Esau went to the field to hunt venison , to bring it .
DARBY	Genesis	27	6	And Rebecca spoke to Jacob her son , saying , Behold , I heard thy father speak to Esau thy brother , saying ,
DARBY	Genesis	27	7	Bring me venison , and prepare me a savoury dish , that I may eat , and bless thee before Jehovah , before my death .
DARBY	Genesis	27	8	And now , my son , hearken to my voice in that which I command thee .
DARBY	Genesis	27	9	Go , I pray thee , to the flock , and fetch me thence two good kids of the goats . And I will make of them a savoury dish for thy father , such as he loves .
DARBY	Genesis	27	10	And thou shalt bring [ it ] to thy father , that he may eat , in order that he may bless thee before his death .
DARBY	Genesis	27	11	And Jacob said to Rebecca his mother , Behold , Esau my brother is a hairy man , and I am a smooth man .
DARBY	Genesis	27	12	My father perhaps will feel me , and I shall be in his sight as one who mocks [ him ] , and I shall bring a curse on me , and not a blessing .
DARBY	Genesis	27	13	And his mother said to him , On me [ be ] thy curse , my son ! Only hearken to my voice , and go , fetch [ them ] .
DARBY	Genesis	27	14	And he went , and fetched and brought [ them ] to his mother . And his mother prepared a savoury dish such as his father loved .
DARBY	Genesis	27	15	And Rebecca took the clothes of her elder son Esau , the costly ones which were with her in the house , and put them on Jacob her younger son ;
DARBY	Genesis	27	16	and she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands , and on the smooth of his neck ;
DARBY	Genesis	27	17	and she gave the savoury dishes and the bread that she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob .
DARBY	Genesis	27	18	And he came to his father , and said , My father ! And he said , Here am I : who art thou , my son ?
DARBY	Genesis	27	19	And Jacob said to his father , I am Esau , thy firstborn . I have done according as thou didst say to me . Arise , I pray thee , sit and eat of my venison , in order that thy soul may bless me .
DARBY	Genesis	27	20	And Isaac said to his son , How is it that thou hast found [ it ] so quickly , my son ? And he said , Because Jehovah thy God put [ it ] in my way .
DARBY	Genesis	27	21	And Isaac said to Jacob , Come near , I pray thee , that I may feel thee , my son , whether thou be really my son Esau or not .
DARBY	Genesis	27	22	And Jacob drew near to Isaac his father ; and he felt him , and said , The voice is Jacob 's voice , but the hands are the hands of Esau .
DARBY	Genesis	27	23	And he did not discern him , because his hands were hairy , as his brother Esau 's hands ; and he blessed him .
DARBY	Genesis	27	24	And he said , Art thou really my son Esau ? And he said , It is I .
DARBY	Genesis	27	25	And he said , Bring [ it ] near to me , that I may eat of my son 's venison , in order that my soul may bless thee . And he brought [ it ] near to him , and he ate ; and he brought him wine , and he drank .
DARBY	Genesis	27	26	And his father Isaac said to him , Come near , now , and kiss me , my son .
DARBY	Genesis	27	28	And God give thee of the dew of heaven , And of the fatness of the earth , And plenty of corn and new wine .
DARBY	Genesis	27	29	Let peoples serve thee , And races bow down to thee . Be lord over thy brethren , And let thy mother 's sons bow down to thee . Cursed be they that curse thee , And blessed be they that bless thee .
DARBY	Genesis	27	30	And it came to pass when Isaac had ended blessing Jacob , and when Jacob was only just gone out from Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came from his hunting .
DARBY	Genesis	27	31	And he also had prepared savoury dishes , and he brought [ them ] in to his father , and said to his father , Let my father arise and eat of his son 's venison , in order that thy soul may bless me .
DARBY	Genesis	27	32	And Isaac his father said to him , Who art thou ? And he said , I am thy son , thy firstborn , Esau .
DARBY	Genesis	27	33	Then Isaac trembled with exceeding great trembling , and said , Who was he , then , that hunted venison and brought [ it ] to me ? And I have eaten of all before thou camest , and have blessed him ; also blessed he shall be .
DARBY	Genesis	27	34	When Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said to his father , Bless me—me also , my father !
DARBY	Genesis	27	35	And he said , Thy brother came with subtilty , and has taken away thy blessing .
DARBY	Genesis	27	36	And he said , Is it not therefore he was named Jacob , for he has supplanted me now twice ? He took away my birthright , and behold , now he has taken away my blessing . And he said , Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me ?
DARBY	Genesis	27	37	And Isaac answered and said to Esau , Behold , I have made him lord over thee , and all his brethren have I given to him for servants , and with corn and new wine have I supplied him—and what can I do now for thee , my son ?
DARBY	Genesis	27	38	And Esau said to his father , Hast thou then but one blessing , my father ? bless me—me also , my father ! And Esau lifted up his voice and wept .
DARBY	Genesis	27	39	And Isaac his father answered and said to him , Behold , thy dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth , And of the dew of heaven from above ;
DARBY	Genesis	27	40	And by thy sword shalt thou live ; And thou shalt serve thy brother ; And it shall come to pass when thou rovest about , That thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck .
DARBY	Genesis	27	41	And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him . And Esau said in his heart , The days of mourning for my father are at hand , and I will slay my brother Jacob .
DARBY	Genesis	27	42	And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebecca . And she sent and called Jacob her younger son , and said to him , Behold , thy brother Esau , as touching thee , comforts himself that he will kill thee .
DARBY	Genesis	27	43	And now , my son , hearken to my voice , and arise , flee to Laban my brother , to Haran ;
DARBY	Genesis	27	44	and abide with him some days , until thy brother 's fury turn away—
DARBY	Genesis	27	45	until thy brother 's anger turn away from thee , and he forget what thou hast done to him ; then I will send and fetch thee thence . Why should I be bereaved even of you both in one day ?
DARBY	Genesis	27	46	And Rebecca said to Isaac , I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth . If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth , such as these , of the daughters of the land , what good should my life do me ?
DARBY	Genesis	28	28	And Isaac called Jacob , and blessed him , and charged him , and said to him , Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan .
DARBY	Genesis	28	2	Arise , go to Padan-Aram , to the house of Bethuel thy mother 's father , and take a wife thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother 's brother .
DARBY	Genesis	28	3	And the Almighty God bless thee , and make thee fruitful and multiply thee , that thou mayest become a company of peoples .
DARBY	Genesis	28	4	And may he give thee the blessing of Abraham , to thee and to thy seed with thee , in order that thou mayest possess the land of thy sojourning , which God gave to Abraham !
DARBY	Genesis	28	5	And Isaac sent away Jacob ; and he went to Padan-Aram , to Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian , the brother of Rebecca , Jacob 's and Esau 's mother .
DARBY	Genesis	28	6	And Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob , and sent him away to Padan-Aram , to take a wife thence , blessing him , and giving him a charge saying , Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan ;
DARBY	Genesis	28	7	and [ that ] Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother , and was gone to Padan-Aram .
DARBY	Genesis	28	8	And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the sight of Isaac his father .
DARBY	Genesis	28	9	And Esau went to Ishmael , and took , besides the wives that he had , Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham 's son , the sister of Nebaioth , to be his wife .
DARBY	Genesis	28	10	And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba , and went towards Haran .
DARBY	Genesis	28	11	And he lighted on a certain place , and lodged there , because the sun had set . And he took [ one ] of the stones of the place , and made [ it ] his pillow , and lay down in that place .
DARBY	Genesis	28	12	And he dreamed , and behold , a ladder was set up on the earth , and the top of it reached to the heavens . And behold , angels of God ascended and descended upon it .
DARBY	Genesis	28	13	And behold , Jehovah stood above it . And he said , I am Jehovah , the God of Abraham , thy father , and the God of Isaac : the land on which thou liest , to thee will I give it , and to thy seed .
DARBY	Genesis	28	14	And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth , and thou shalt spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south ; and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed .
DARBY	Genesis	28	15	And behold , I am with thee , and will keep thee in all [ places ] to which thou goest , and will bring thee again into this land ; for I will not leave thee until I have done what I have spoken to thee of .
DARBY	Genesis	28	16	And Jacob awoke from his sleep , and said , Surely Jehovah is in this place , and I knew [ it ] not .
DARBY	Genesis	28	17	And he was afraid , and said , How dreadful is this place ! this is none other but the house of God , and this is the gate of heaven .
DARBY	Genesis	28	18	And Jacob rose early in the morning , and took the stone that he had made his pillow , and set it up [ for ] a pillar , and poured oil on the top of it .
DARBY	Genesis	28	19	And he called the name of that place Beth-el ; but the name of that city was Luz at the first .
DARBY	Genesis	28	20	And Jacob vowed a vow , saying , If God will be with me , and keep me on this road that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and a garment to put on ,
DARBY	Genesis	28	21	and I come again to my father 's house in peace—then shall Jehovah be my God .
DARBY	Genesis	28	22	And this stone , which I have set up [ for ] a pillar , shall be God 's house ; and of all that thou wilt give me I will without fail give the tenth to thee .
DARBY	Genesis	29	29	And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter , Bilhah , his maidservant , to be her maidservant .
DARBY	Genesis	29	2	And he looked , and behold , there was a well in the fields , and behold there , three flocks of sheep were lying by it ; for out of that well they watered the flocks , and a great stone was at the mouth of the well .
DARBY	Genesis	29	3	And when all the flocks were gathered there , they rolled the stone from the mouth of the well , and watered the sheep , and put the stone again on the mouth of the well in its place .
DARBY	Genesis	29	4	And Jacob said to them , My brethren , whence are ye ? And they said , Of Haran are we .
DARBY	Genesis	29	5	And he said to them , Do ye know Laban the son of Nahor ? And they said , We do know [ him ] .
DARBY	Genesis	29	6	And he said to them , Is he well ? And they said , [ He is ] well ; and behold , there comes Rachel his daughter with the sheep .
DARBY	Genesis	29	7	And he said , Behold , it is yet high day ; it is not time that the cattle should be gathered together ; water the sheep , and go , feed [ them ] .
DARBY	Genesis	29	8	And they said , We can not until all the flocks are gathered together , and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well , and we water the sheep .
DARBY	Genesis	29	9	While he was still speaking to them , Rachel came with her father 's sheep , for she was a shepherdess .
DARBY	Genesis	29	10	And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother 's brother , and the sheep of Laban his mother 's brother , that Jacob went near , and rolled the stone from the mouth of the well , and watered the sheep of Laban his mother 's brother .
DARBY	Genesis	29	11	And Jacob kissed Rachel , and lifted up his voice and wept .
DARBY	Genesis	29	12	And Jacob told Rachel that he was a brother of her father , and that he was Rebecca 's son ; and she ran and told her father .
DARBY	Genesis	29	13	And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister 's son , that he ran to meet him , and embraced him , and kissed him , and brought him to his house ; and he told Laban all these things .
DARBY	Genesis	29	14	And Laban said to him , Thou art indeed my bone and my flesh . And he abode with him a month 's time .
DARBY	Genesis	29	15	And Laban said to Jacob , Because thou art my brother , shouldest thou serve me for nothing ? tell me , what shall be thy wages ?
DARBY	Genesis	29	16	And Laban had two daughters : the name of the elder was Leah , and the name of the younger , Rachel .
DARBY	Genesis	29	17	And the eyes of Leah were tender ; but Rachel was of beautiful form and beautiful countenance .
DARBY	Genesis	29	18	And Jacob loved Rachel , and said , I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter .
DARBY	Genesis	29	19	And Laban said , It is better that I give her to thee than that I should give her to another man : abide with me .
DARBY	Genesis	29	20	And Jacob served seven years for Rachel ; and they were in his eyes as single days , because he loved her .
DARBY	Genesis	29	21	And Jacob said to Laban , Give [ me ] my wife , for my days are fulfilled , that I may go in to her .
DARBY	Genesis	29	22	And Laban gathered together all the men of the place , and made a feast .
DARBY	Genesis	29	23	And it came to pass in the evening , that he took Leah his daughter , and brought her to him ; and he went in to her .
DARBY	Genesis	29	24	And Laban gave to her Zilpah , his maidservant , to be maidservant to Leah his daughter .
DARBY	Genesis	29	25	And it came to pass in the morning , that behold , it was Leah . And he said to Laban , What is this thou hast done to me ? Have I not served thee for Rachel ? Why then hast thou deceived me ?
DARBY	Genesis	29	26	And Laban said , It is not so done in our place , to give the younger before the firstborn .
DARBY	Genesis	29	27	Fulfil the week [ with ] this one : then we will give thee the other one also , for the service that thou shalt serve me yet seven other years .
DARBY	Genesis	29	28	And Jacob did so , and fulfilled the week [ with ] this one , and he gave him Rachel his daughter to be his wife .
DARBY	Genesis	29	30	And he went in also to Rachel ; and he loved also Rachel more than Leah . And he served with him yet seven other years .
DARBY	Genesis	29	31	And when Jehovah saw that Leah was hated , he opened her womb ; but Rachel was barren .
DARBY	Genesis	29	32	And Leah conceived , and bore a son , and called his name Reuben ; for she said , Because Jehovah has looked upon my affliction ; for now my husband will love me .
DARBY	Genesis	29	33	And she again conceived , and bore a son , and said , Because Jehovah has heard that I am hated , he has therefore given me this one also ; and she called his name Simeon .
DARBY	Genesis	29	34	And she again conceived , and bore a son , and said , Now this time will my husband be united to me , for I have borne him three sons ; therefore was his name called Levi .
DARBY	Genesis	29	35	And she again conceived , and bore a son , and said , This time will I praise Jehovah ; therefore she called his name Judah . And she ceased to bear .
DARBY	Genesis	30	30	For it was little that thou hadst before me , and it is increased to a multitude , and Jehovah has blessed thee from the time I came ; and now , when shall I also provide for my house ?
DARBY	Genesis	30	2	And Jacob 's anger was kindled against Rachel , and he said , Am I in God 's stead , who has withheld from thee the fruit of the womb ?
DARBY	Genesis	30	3	And she said , Behold , there is my maid , Bilhah : go in to her , in order that she may bear on my knees , and I may also be built up by her .
DARBY	Genesis	30	4	And she gave him Bilhah her maidservant as wife , and Jacob went in to her .
DARBY	Genesis	30	5	And Bilhah conceived , and bore Jacob a son .
DARBY	Genesis	30	6	And Rachel said , God has done me justice , and has also heard my voice , and given me a son ; therefore she called his name Dan .
DARBY	Genesis	30	7	And Bilhah Rachel 's maidservant again conceived , and bore Jacob a second son .
DARBY	Genesis	30	8	And Rachel said , Wrestlings of God have I wrestled with my sister , and have prevailed ; and she called his name Naphtali .
DARBY	Genesis	30	9	And when Leah saw that she had ceased to bear , she took Zilpah her maidservant and gave her to Jacob as wife .
DARBY	Genesis	30	10	And Zilpah Leah 's maidservant bore Jacob a son .
DARBY	Genesis	30	11	And Leah said , Fortunately ! and she called his name Gad .
DARBY	Genesis	30	12	And Zilpah Leah 's maidservant bore Jacob a second son .
DARBY	Genesis	30	13	And Leah said , Happy am I ; for the daughters will call me blessed ! and she called his name Asher .
DARBY	Genesis	30	14	And Reuben went out in the days of wheat-harvest , and found mandrakes in the fields ; and he brought them to his mother Leah . And Rachel said to Leah , Give me , I pray thee , of thy son 's mandrakes .
DARBY	Genesis	30	15	And she said to her , Is it [ too ] little that thou hast taken my husband , that thou wilt take my son 's mandrakes also ? And Rachel said , Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son 's mandrakes .
DARBY	Genesis	30	16	And when Jacob came from the fields in the evening , Leah went out to meet him , and said , Thou must come in to me , for indeed I have hired thee with my son 's mandrakes . And he lay with her that night .
DARBY	Genesis	30	17	And God hearkened to Leah , and she conceived , and bore Jacob a fifth son .
DARBY	Genesis	30	18	And Leah said , God has given me my hire , because I have given my maidservant to my husband ; and she called his name Issachar .
DARBY	Genesis	30	19	And Leah again conceived , and bore Jacob a sixth son ;
DARBY	Genesis	30	20	and Leah said , God has endowed me with a good dowry ; this time will my husband dwell with me , because I have borne him six sons . And she called his name Zebulun .
DARBY	Genesis	30	21	And afterwards she bore a daughter , and called her name Dinah .
DARBY	Genesis	30	22	And God remembered Rachel , and God listened to her , and opened her womb .
DARBY	Genesis	30	23	And she conceived , and bore a son , and said , God has taken away my reproach .
DARBY	Genesis	30	24	And she called his name Joseph ; and said , Jehovah will add to me another son .
DARBY	Genesis	30	25	And it came to pass when Rachel had borne Joseph , that Jacob said to Laban , Send me away , that I may go to my place and to my country .
DARBY	Genesis	30	26	Give [ me ] my wives for whom I have served thee , and my children ; that I may go away , for thou knowest my service which I have served thee .
DARBY	Genesis	30	27	And Laban said to him , I pray thee , if I have found favour in thine eyes—I have discovered that Jehovah has blessed me for thy sake .
DARBY	Genesis	30	28	And he said , Appoint to me thy wages , and I will give it .
DARBY	Genesis	30	29	And he said to him , Thou knowest how I have served thee , and what thy cattle has become with me .
DARBY	Genesis	30	31	And he said , What shall I give thee ? And Jacob said , Thou shalt not give me anything . If thou doest this for me , I will again feed [ and ] keep thy flock :
DARBY	Genesis	30	32	I will pass through all thy flock to-day , to remove thence all the speckled and spotted sheep , and all the brown lambs , and the spotted and speckled among the goats ; and [ that ] shall be my hire .
DARBY	Genesis	30	33	And my righteousness shall answer for me hereafter , when thou comest about my hire , before thy face : all that is not speckled and spotted among the goats , and brown among the lambs , let that be stolen with me .
DARBY	Genesis	30	34	And Laban said , Well , let it be according to thy word .
DARBY	Genesis	30	35	And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstraked and spotted , and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted , every one that had white in it , and all the brown among the lambs , and gave [ them ] into the hand of his sons .
DARBY	Genesis	30	36	And he put three days ' journey between himself and Jacob . And Jacob fed the rest of Laban 's flock .
DARBY	Genesis	30	37	And Jacob took fresh rods of white poplar , almond-tree , and maple ; and peeled off white stripes in them , uncovering the white which was on the rods .
DARBY	Genesis	30	38	And he set the rods which he had peeled before the flock , in the troughs at the watering-places where the flock came to drink , and they were ardent when they came to drink .
DARBY	Genesis	30	39	And the flock was ardent before the rods ; and the flock brought forth ringstraked , speckled , and spotted .
DARBY	Genesis	30	40	And Jacob separated the lambs , and set the faces of the flock toward the ringstraked , and all the brown in the flock of Laban ; and he made himself separate flocks , and did not put them with Laban 's flock .
DARBY	Genesis	30	41	And it came to pass whensoever the strong cattle were ardent , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters , that they might become ardent among the rods ;
DARBY	Genesis	30	42	but when the sheep were feeble , he put [ them ] not in ; so the feeble were Laban 's , and the strong Jacob 's .
DARBY	Genesis	30	43	And the man increased very , very much , and had much cattle , and bondwomen , and bondmen , and camels , and asses .
DARBY	Genesis	31	31	And Jacob answered and said to Laban , I was afraid ; for I said , Lest thou shouldest take by force thy daughters from me .
DARBY	Genesis	31	2	And Jacob saw the countenance of Laban , and behold , it was not toward him as previously .
DARBY	Genesis	31	3	And Jehovah said to Jacob , Return into the land of thy fathers , and to thy kindred ; and I will be with thee .
DARBY	Genesis	31	4	And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the fields to his flock ,
DARBY	Genesis	31	5	and said to them , I see your father 's countenance , that it is not toward me as previously ; but the God of my father has been with me .
DARBY	Genesis	31	6	And you know that with all my power I have served your father .
DARBY	Genesis	31	7	And your father has mocked me , and has changed my wages ten times ; but God suffered him not to hurt me .
DARBY	Genesis	31	8	If he said thus ; The speckled shall be thy hire , then all the flocks bore speckled ; and if he said thus : The ringstraked shall be thy hire , then all the flocks bore ringstraked .
DARBY	Genesis	31	9	And God has taken away the cattle of your father , and given [ them ] to me .
DARBY	Genesis	31	10	And it came to pass at the time of the ardour of the flocks , that I lifted up mine eyes , and saw in a dream , and behold , the rams that leaped upon the flocks were ringstraked , speckled , and spotted .
DARBY	Genesis	31	11	And the Angel of God said to me in a dream , Jacob ! And I said , Here am I .
DARBY	Genesis	31	12	And he said , Lift up now thine eyes , and see : all the rams that leap upon the flock are ringstraked , speckled , and spotted ; for I have seen all that Laban does to thee .
DARBY	Genesis	31	13	I am the God of Bethel , where thou anointedst the pillar , where thou vowedst a vow to me . Now arise , depart out of this land , and return to the land of thy kindred .
DARBY	Genesis	31	14	And Rachel and Leah answered and said to him , Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father 's house ?
DARBY	Genesis	31	15	Are we not reckoned of him strangers ? for he has sold us , and has even constantly devoured our money .
DARBY	Genesis	31	16	For all the wealth that God has taken from our father is ours and our children 's ; and now whatever God has said to thee do .
DARBY	Genesis	31	17	And Jacob rose up , and set his sons and his wives upon camels ,
DARBY	Genesis	31	18	and carried away all his cattle , and all his property that he had acquired—the cattle of his possessions that he had acquired in Padan-Aram , to go to Isaac his father , into the land of Canaan .
DARBY	Genesis	31	19	And Laban had gone to shear his sheep . And Rachel stole the teraphim that [ belonged ] to her father .
DARBY	Genesis	31	20	And Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian , in that he did not tell him that he fled .
DARBY	Genesis	31	21	And he fled with all that he had ; and he rose up and passed over the river , and set his face [ toward ] mount Gilead .
DARBY	Genesis	31	22	And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled .
DARBY	Genesis	31	23	And he took his brethren with him , and pursued after him seven days ' journey , and overtook him on mount Gilead .
DARBY	Genesis	31	24	And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night , and said to him , Take care thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad .
DARBY	Genesis	31	25	And Laban came up with Jacob ; and Jacob had pitched his tent on the mountain ; Laban also with his brethren pitched on mount Gilead .
DARBY	Genesis	31	26	And Laban said to Jacob , What hast thou done , that thou hast deceived me , and hast carried away my daughters as captives of war ?
DARBY	Genesis	31	27	Why didst thou flee away covertly , and steal away from me , and didst not tell me , that I might have conducted thee with mirth and with songs , with tambour and with harp ;
DARBY	Genesis	31	28	and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? Now thou hast acted foolishly .
DARBY	Genesis	31	29	It would be in the power of my hand to do you hurt ; but the God of your father spoke to me last night , saying , Take care that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad .
DARBY	Genesis	31	30	And now that thou must needs be gone , because thou greatly longedst after thy father 's house , why hast thou stolen my gods ?
DARBY	Genesis	31	32	With whomsoever thou findest thy gods , he shall not live . Before our brethren discern what is thine with me , and take [ it ] to thee . But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them .
DARBY	Genesis	31	33	And Laban went into Jacob 's tent , and into Leah 's tent , and into the two handmaids ' tents , and found nothing ; and he went out of Leah 's tent , and entered into Rachel 's tent .
DARBY	Genesis	31	34	Now Rachel had taken the teraphim and put them under the camel 's saddle ; and she sat upon them . And Laban explored all the tent , but found nothing .
DARBY	Genesis	31	35	And she said to her father , Let it not be an occasion of anger in the eyes of my lord that I can not rise up before thee , for it is with me after the manner of women . And he searched carefully , but did not find the teraphim .
DARBY	Genesis	31	36	And Jacob was angry , and he disputed with Laban . And Jacob answered and said to Laban , What is my fault , what my sin , that thou hast so hotly pursued after me ?
DARBY	Genesis	31	37	Whereas thou hast explored all my baggage , what hast thou found of all thy household stuff ? Set [ it ] here before my brethren and thy brethren , and let them decide between us both .
DARBY	Genesis	31	38	These twenty years have I been with thee : thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young , and the rams of thy flock I have not eaten .
DARBY	Genesis	31	39	What was torn I have not brought to thee ; I had to bear the loss of it : of my hand hast thou required it , [ whether ] stolen by day or stolen by night .
DARBY	Genesis	31	40	Thus it was with me : in the day the heat consumed me , and the frost by night ; and my sleep fled from mine eyes .
DARBY	Genesis	31	41	I have been these twenty years in thy house : I have served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters , and six years for thy flock ; and thou hast changed my wages ten times .
DARBY	Genesis	31	42	Had not the God of my father , the God of Abraham , and the fear of Isaac , been with me , it is certain thou wouldest have sent me away now empty . God has looked upon my affliction and the labour of my hands , and has judged last night .
DARBY	Genesis	31	43	And Laban answered and said to Jacob , The daughters are my daughters , and the sons are my sons , and the flock is my flock , and all that thou seest is mine ; but as for my daughters , what can I do this day to them , or to their sons whom they have brought forth ?
DARBY	Genesis	31	44	And now , come , let us make a covenant , I and thou ; and let it be a witness between me and thee .
DARBY	Genesis	31	45	And Jacob took a stone , and set it up [ for ] a pillar .
DARBY	Genesis	31	46	And Jacob said to his brethren , Gather stones . And they took stones , and made a heap , and ate there upon the heap .
DARBY	Genesis	31	47	And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha , and Jacob called it Galeed .
DARBY	Genesis	31	48	And Laban said , This heap is a witness between me and thee this day . Therefore was the name of it called Galeed ,
DARBY	Genesis	31	49	—and Mizpah ; for he said , Let Jehovah watch between me and thee , when we shall be hidden one from another :
DARBY	Genesis	31	50	if thou shouldest afflict my daughters , or if thou shouldest take wives besides my daughters , —no man is with us ; see , God is witness between me and thee !
DARBY	Genesis	31	51	And Laban said to Jacob , Behold this heap , and behold the pillar which I have set up between me and thee :
DARBY	Genesis	31	52	[ let ] this heap be witness , and the pillar a witness , that neither I pass this heap [ to go ] to thee , nor thou pass this heap and this pillar [ to come ] to me , for harm .
DARBY	Genesis	31	53	The God of Abraham , and the God of Nahor , the God of their father , judge between us ! And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac .
DARBY	Genesis	31	54	And Jacob offered a sacrifice upon the mountain , and invited his brethren to eat bread : and they ate bread , and lodged on the mountain .
DARBY	Genesis	31	55	And Laban rose early in the morning , and kissed his sons and his daughters , and blessed them ; and Laban went and returned to his place .
DARBY	Genesis	32	32	Therefore the children of Israel do not eat of the sinew that is over the joint of the thigh , to this day ; because he touched the joint of Jacob 's thigh—the sinew .
DARBY	Genesis	32	2	And when Jacob saw them he said , This is the camp of God . And he called the name of that place Mahanaim .
DARBY	Genesis	32	3	And Jacob sent messengers before his face to Esau his brother , into the land of Seir , the fields of Edom .
DARBY	Genesis	32	4	And he commanded them , saying , Thus shall ye speak to my lord , to Esau : Thy servant Jacob speaks thus—With Laban have I sojourned and tarried until now ;
DARBY	Genesis	32	5	and I have oxen , and asses , sheep , and bondmen , and bondwomen ; and I have sent to tell my lord , that I may find favour in thine eyes .
DARBY	Genesis	32	6	And the messengers returned to Jacob , saying , We came to thy brother , to Esau ; and he also is coming to meet thee , and four hundred men with him .
DARBY	Genesis	32	7	Then Jacob was greatly afraid , and was distressed ; and he divided the people that were with him , and the sheep and the cattle and the camels , into two troops .
DARBY	Genesis	32	8	And he said , If Esau come to the one troop and smite it , then the other troop which is left shall escape .
DARBY	Genesis	32	9	And Jacob said , God of my father Abraham , and God of my father Isaac , Jehovah , who saidst unto me : Return into thy country and to thy kindred , and I will do thee good ,
DARBY	Genesis	32	10	—I am too small for all the loving-kindness and all the faithfulness that thou hast shewn unto thy servant ; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan , and now I am become two troops .
DARBY	Genesis	32	11	Deliver me , I pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Esau ; for I fear him , lest he come and smite me , [ and ] the mother with the children .
DARBY	Genesis	32	12	And thou saidst , I will certainly deal well with thee , and make thy seed as the sand of the sea , which can not be numbered for multitude .
DARBY	Genesis	32	13	And he lodged there that night ; and took of what came to his hand a gift for Esau his brother—
DARBY	Genesis	32	14	two hundred she-goats , and twenty he-goats ; two hundred ewes , and twenty rams ;
DARBY	Genesis	32	15	thirty milch camels with their colts ; forty kine , and ten bulls ; twenty she-asses , and ten young asses .
DARBY	Genesis	32	16	And he delivered [ them ] into the hand of his servants , every drove by itself ; and he said to his servants , Go on before me , and put a space between drove and drove .
DARBY	Genesis	32	17	And he commanded the foremost , saying , When Esau my brother meets thee , and asks thee , saying , Whose art thou , and where goest thou , and whose are these before thee ?
DARBY	Genesis	32	18	—then thou shalt say , Thy servant Jacob 's : it is a gift sent to my lord , to Esau . And behold , he also is behind us .
DARBY	Genesis	32	19	And so commanded he the second , and the third , and all that followed the droves , saying , According to this word shall ye speak to Esau when ye find him .
DARBY	Genesis	32	20	And , moreover , ye shall say , Behold , thy servant Jacob is behind us . For he said , I will propitiate him with the gift that goes before me , and afterwards I will see his face : perhaps he will accept me .
DARBY	Genesis	32	21	And the gift went over before him ; and he himself lodged that night in the camp .
DARBY	Genesis	32	22	And he rose up that night , and took his two wives , and his two maidservants , and his eleven sons , and passed over the ford of the Jabbok ;
DARBY	Genesis	32	23	and he took them and led them over the river , and led over what he had .
DARBY	Genesis	32	24	And Jacob remained alone ; and a man wrestled with him until the rising of the dawn .
DARBY	Genesis	32	25	And when he saw that he did not prevail against him , he touched the joint of his thigh ; and the joint of Jacob 's thigh was dislocated as he wrestled with him .
DARBY	Genesis	32	26	And he said , Let me go , for the dawn ariseth . And he said , I will not let thee go except thou bless me .
DARBY	Genesis	32	27	And he said to him , What is thy name ? And he said , Jacob .
DARBY	Genesis	32	28	And he said , Thy name shall not henceforth be called Jacob , but Israel ; for thou hast wrestled with God , and with men , and hast prevailed .
DARBY	Genesis	32	29	And Jacob asked and said , Tell [ me ] , I pray thee , thy name . And he said , How is it that thou askest after my name ? And he blessed him there .
DARBY	Genesis	32	30	And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel—For I have seen God face to face , and my life has been preserved .
DARBY	Genesis	32	31	And as he passed over Peniel , the sun rose upon him ; and he limped upon his hip .
DARBY	Genesis	33	33	And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked , and behold , Esau was coming , and with him four hundred men . And he distributed the children to Leah , and to Rachel , and to the two maidservants :
DARBY	Genesis	33	2	and he put the maidservants and their children foremost , and Leah and her children after , and Rachel and Joseph hindmost .
DARBY	Genesis	33	3	And he passed on before them , and bowed to the earth seven times , until he came near to his brother .
DARBY	Genesis	33	4	And Esau ran to meet him , and embraced him , and fell on his neck , and kissed him ; and they wept .
DARBY	Genesis	33	5	And he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children , and said , Who are these with thee ? And he said , The children that God has graciously given thy servant .
DARBY	Genesis	33	6	And the maidservants drew near , they and their children , and they bowed .
DARBY	Genesis	33	7	And Leah also , with her children , drew near , and they bowed . And lastly Joseph drew near , and Rachel , and they bowed .
DARBY	Genesis	33	8	And he said , What [ meanest ] thou by all the drove which I met ? And he said , To find favour in the eyes of my lord .
DARBY	Genesis	33	9	And Esau said , I have enough , my brother ; let what thou hast be thine .
DARBY	Genesis	33	10	And Jacob said , No , I pray thee ; if now I have found favour in thine eyes , then receive my gift from my hand ; for therefore have I seen thy face , as though I had seen the face of God , and thou hast received me with pleasure .
DARBY	Genesis	33	11	Take , I pray thee , my blessing which has been brought to thee ; because God has been gracious to me , and because I have everything . And he urged him , and he took [ it ] .
DARBY	Genesis	33	12	And he said , Let us take our journey , and go on , and I will go before thee .
DARBY	Genesis	33	13	And he said to him , My lord knows that the children are tender , and the suckling sheep and kine are with me ; and if they should overdrive them only one day , all the flock would die .
DARBY	Genesis	33	14	Let my lord , I pray thee , pass on before his servant , and I will drive on at my ease according to the pace of the cattle that is before me , and according to the pace of the children , until I come to my lord , to Seir .
DARBY	Genesis	33	15	And Esau said , Let me now leave with thee [ some ] of the people that are with me . And he said , What need ? Let me find favour in the eyes of my lord .
DARBY	Genesis	33	16	And Esau returned that day on his way to Seir .
DARBY	Genesis	33	17	And Jacob journeyed to Succoth , and built himself a house , and for his cattle he made booths . Therefore the name of the place was called Succoth .
DARBY	Genesis	33	18	And Jacob came safely [ to the ] city Shechem , which is in the land of Canaan , when he came from Padan-Aram ; and he encamped before the city .
DARBY	Genesis	33	19	And he bought the portion of the field where he had spread his tent , of the hand of the sons of Hamor , Shechem 's father , for a hundred kesitahs .
DARBY	Genesis	33	20	And there he set up an altar , and called it El-Elohe-Israel .
DARBY	Genesis	34	34	And Dinah the daughter of Leah , whom she had borne to Jacob , went out to see the daughters of the land .
DARBY	Genesis	34	2	And when Shechem , the son of Hamor the Hivite , the prince of the country , saw her , he took her , and lay with her , and humbled her .
DARBY	Genesis	34	3	And his soul fastened on Dinah the daughter of Jacob , and he loved the maiden , and spoke consolingly to the maiden .
DARBY	Genesis	34	4	And Shechem spoke to his father Hamor , saying , Take me this girl as wife .
DARBY	Genesis	34	5	And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter ; but his sons were with his cattle in the fields , and Jacob said nothing until they came .
DARBY	Genesis	34	6	And Hamor the father of Shechem came out to Jacob , to speak to him .
DARBY	Genesis	34	7	And the sons of Jacob came from the fields when they heard [ it ] ; and the men were grieved , and they were very angry , because he had wrought what was disgraceful in Israel , in lying with Jacob 's daughter , which thing ought not to be done .
DARBY	Genesis	34	8	And Hamor spoke to them , saying , My son Shechem 's soul cleaves to your daughter : I pray you , give her to him as wife .
DARBY	Genesis	34	9	And make marriages with us : give your daughters to us , and take our daughters to you .
DARBY	Genesis	34	10	And dwell with us , and the land shall be before you : dwell and trade in it , and get yourselves possessions in it .
DARBY	Genesis	34	11	And Shechem said to her father and to her brethren , Let me find favour in your eyes ; and what ye shall say to me I will give .
DARBY	Genesis	34	12	Impose on me very much as dowry and gift , and I will give according as ye shall say to me ; but give me the maiden as wife .
DARBY	Genesis	34	13	And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully , and spoke—because he had defiled Dinah their sister—
DARBY	Genesis	34	14	and said to them , We can not do this , to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised ; for that [ were ] a reproach to us .
DARBY	Genesis	34	15	But only in this will we consent to you , if ye will be as we , that every male of you be circumcised ;
DARBY	Genesis	34	16	then will we give our daughters to you , and take your daughters to us , and we will dwell with you , and be one people .
DARBY	Genesis	34	17	But if ye do not hearken to us , to be circumcised , then will we take our daughter and go away .
DARBY	Genesis	34	18	And their words were good in the eyes of Hamor and Shechem , Hamor 's son .
DARBY	Genesis	34	19	And the youth did not delay to do this , because he had delight in Jacob 's daughter . And he was honourable above all in the house of his father .
DARBY	Genesis	34	20	And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city , and spoke to the men of their city , saying ,
DARBY	Genesis	34	21	These men are peaceable with us ; therefore let them dwell in the land , and trade in it . And the land—behold , it is of wide extent before them . We will take their daughters as wives , and give them our daughters .
DARBY	Genesis	34	22	But only in this will the men consent to us to dwell with us , to be one people—if every male among us be circumcised , just as they are circumcised .
DARBY	Genesis	34	23	Their cattle , and their possessions , and every beast of theirs , shall they not be ours ? only let us consent to them , and they will dwell with us .
DARBY	Genesis	34	24	And all that went out at the gate of his city hearkened to Hamor and to Shechem his son ; and every male was circumcised—all that went out at the gate of his city .
DARBY	Genesis	34	25	And it came to pass on the third day , when they were sore , that two of the sons of Jacob , Simeon and Levi , Dinah 's brethren , took each his sword , and came upon the city boldly , and slew all the males .
DARBY	Genesis	34	26	And Hamor and Shechem his son they slew with the edge of the sword ; and took Dinah out of Shechem 's house ; and went out .
DARBY	Genesis	34	27	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain , and plundered the city , because they had defiled their sister .
DARBY	Genesis	34	28	Their sheep , and their oxen , and their asses , and what [ was ] in the city , and what [ was ] in the field they took ;
DARBY	Genesis	34	29	and all their goods , and all their little ones , and their wives took they captive , and plundered them , and all that was in the houses .
DARBY	Genesis	34	30	And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi , Ye have troubled me , in that ye make me odious among the inhabitants of the land—among the Canaanites and the Perizzites ; and I am few men in number , and they will gather themselves against me and smite me , and I shall be destroyed , I and my house .
DARBY	Genesis	34	31	And they said , Should people deal with our sister as with a harlot ?
DARBY	Genesis	35	35	And God said to Jacob , Arise , go up to Bethel , and dwell there , and make there an altar unto the God that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother .
DARBY	Genesis	35	2	And Jacob said to his household , and to all that were with him , Put away the strange gods that are among you , and cleanse yourselves , and change your garments ;
DARBY	Genesis	35	3	and we will arise , and go up to Bethel ; and I will make there an altar to the God that answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way that I went .
DARBY	Genesis	35	4	And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods that were in their hand , and the rings that were in their ears , and Jacob hid them under the terebinth that [ is ] by Shechem .
DARBY	Genesis	35	5	And they journeyed ; and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them , and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob .
DARBY	Genesis	35	6	And Jacob came to Luz , which is in the land of Canaan , that is , Bethel , he and all the people that were with him .
DARBY	Genesis	35	7	And he built there an altar , and called the place El-beth-el ; because there God had appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother .
DARBY	Genesis	35	8	And Deborah , Rebecca 's nurse , died ; and she was buried beneath Bethel , under the oak ; and the name of it was called Allon-bachuth .
DARBY	Genesis	35	9	And God appeared to Jacob again after he had come from Padan-Aram , and blessed him .
DARBY	Genesis	35	10	And God said to him , Thy name is Jacob : thy name shall not henceforth be called Jacob , but Israel shall be thy name . And he called his name Israel .
DARBY	Genesis	35	11	And God said to him , I am the Almighty God : be fruitful and multiply ; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee ; and kings shall come out of thy loins .
DARBY	Genesis	35	12	And the land that I gave Abraham and Isaac , to thee will I give it , and to thy seed after thee will I give the land .
DARBY	Genesis	35	13	And God went up from him in the place where he had talked with him .
DARBY	Genesis	35	14	And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had talked with him , a pillar of stone , and poured on it a drink-offering , and poured oil on it .
DARBY	Genesis	35	15	And Jacob called the name of the place where God had talked with him , Beth-el .
DARBY	Genesis	35	16	And they journeyed from Bethel . And there was yet a certain distance to come to Ephrath , when Rachel travailed in childbirth ; and it went hard with her in her childbearing .
DARBY	Genesis	35	17	And it came to pass when it went hard with her in her childbearing , that the midwife said to her , Fear not ; for this also is a son for thee .
DARBY	Genesis	35	18	And it came to pass as her soul was departing—for she died—that she called his name Benoni ; but his father called him Benjamin .
DARBY	Genesis	35	19	And Rachel died , and was buried on the way to Ephrath , which [ is ] Bethlehem .
DARBY	Genesis	35	20	And Jacob erected a pillar upon her grave : that is the pillar of Rachel 's grave to [ this ] day .
DARBY	Genesis	35	21	And Israel journeyed , and spread his tent on the other side of Migdal-Eder .
DARBY	Genesis	35	22	And it came to pass when Israel dwelt in that land , that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah , his father 's concubine ; and Israel heard of it . And the sons of Jacob were twelve .
DARBY	Genesis	35	23	The sons of Leah : Reuben—Jacob 's firstborn—and Simeon , and Levi , and Judah , and Issachar , and Zebulun .
DARBY	Genesis	35	24	The sons of Rachel : Joseph and Benjamin .
DARBY	Genesis	35	25	And the sons of Bilhah , Rachel 's maidservant : Dan and Naphtali .
DARBY	Genesis	35	26	And the sons of Zilpah , Leah 's maidservant : Gad and Asher . These are the sons of Jacob that were born to him in Padan-Aram .
DARBY	Genesis	35	27	And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mamre—to Kirjath-Arba , which is Hebron ; where Abraham had sojourned , and Isaac .
DARBY	Genesis	35	28	And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years .
DARBY	Genesis	35	29	And Isaac expired and died , and was gathered to his peoples , old and full of days . And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him .
DARBY	Genesis	36	36	And Hadad died ; and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead .
DARBY	Genesis	36	2	Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan : Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite , and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah , daughter of Zibeon the Hivite ,
DARBY	Genesis	36	3	and Basmath Ishmael 's daughter , the sister of Nebaioth .
DARBY	Genesis	36	4	And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz ; and Basmath bore Reuel .
DARBY	Genesis	36	5	And Oholibamah bore Jeush and Jaalam and Korah . These are the sons of Esau that were born to him in the land of Canaan .
DARBY	Genesis	36	6	And Esau took his wives , and his sons , and his daughters , and all the souls of his house , and his cattle , and all his beasts , and all his possessions , that he had acquired in the land of Canaan , and went into a country away from his brother Jacob .
DARBY	Genesis	36	7	For their property was too great for them to dwell together , and the land where they were sojourners could not bear them , because of their cattle .
DARBY	Genesis	36	8	Thus Esau dwelt in mount Seir ; Esau is Edom .
DARBY	Genesis	36	9	And these are the generations of Esau , the father of Edom , in mount Seir .
DARBY	Genesis	36	10	These are the names of Esau 's sons : Eliphaz , the son of Adah the wife of Esau ; Reuel , the son of Basmath the wife of Esau .

DARBY	Genesis	36	31	And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom before there reigned a king over the children of Israel .
DARBY	Genesis	36	32	And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom ; and the name of his city was Dinhabah .
DARBY	Genesis	36	33	And Bela died ; and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead .

DARBY	Genesis	37	37	And Jacob dwelt in the land where his father sojourned—in the land of Canaan .
DARBY	Genesis	37	2	These are the generations of Jacob . Joseph , being seventeen years old , fed the flock with his brethren ; and he was doing service with the sons of Bilhah , and with the sons of Zilpah , his father 's wives . And Joseph brought to his father an evil report of them .
DARBY	Genesis	37	3	And Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons , because he was son of his old age ; and he made him a vest of many colours .
DARBY	Genesis	37	4	And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren , and they hated him , and could not greet him with friendliness .
DARBY	Genesis	37	5	And Joseph dreamed a dream , and told [ it ] to his brethren , and they hated him yet the more .
DARBY	Genesis	37	6	And he said to them , Hear , I pray you , this dream , which I have dreamt :
DARBY	Genesis	37	7	Behold , we were binding sheaves in the fields , and lo , my sheaf rose up , and remained standing ; and behold , your sheaves came round about and bowed down to my sheaf .
DARBY	Genesis	37	8	And his brethren said to him , Wilt thou indeed be a king over us ? wilt thou indeed rule over us ? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words .
DARBY	Genesis	37	9	And he dreamed yet another dream , and told it to his brethren , and said , Behold , I have dreamt another dream , and behold , the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me .
DARBY	Genesis	37	10	And he told [ it ] to his father and to his brethren . And his father rebuked him , and said to him , What is this dream which thou hast dreamt ? Shall we indeed come , I and thy mother and thy brethren , to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth ?
DARBY	Genesis	37	11	And his brethren envied him ; but his father kept the saying .
DARBY	Genesis	37	12	And his brethren went to feed their father 's flock at Shechem .
DARBY	Genesis	37	13	And Israel said to Joseph , Do not thy brethren feed [ the flock ] at Shechem ? Come , that I may send thee to them . And he said to him , Here am I .
DARBY	Genesis	37	14	And he said to him , Go , I pray thee , see after the welfare of thy brethren , and after the welfare of the flock ; and bring me word again . And he sent him out of the vale of Hebron ; and he came towards Shechem .
DARBY	Genesis	37	15	And a man found him , and behold , he was wandering in the country ; and the man asked him , saying , What seekest thou ?
DARBY	Genesis	37	16	And he said , I am seeking my brethren : tell me , I pray thee , where they feed [ their flocks ] .
DARBY	Genesis	37	17	And the man said , They have removed from this ; for I heard them say , Let us go to Dothan . And Joseph went after his brethren , and found them at Dothan .
DARBY	Genesis	37	18	And when they saw him from afar , and before he came near to them , they conspired against him to put him to death .
DARBY	Genesis	37	19	And they said one to another , Behold , there comes that dreamer !
DARBY	Genesis	37	20	And now come and let us kill him , and cast him into one of the pits , and we will say , An evil beast has devoured him ; and we will see what becomes of his dreams .
DARBY	Genesis	37	21	And Reuben heard [ it ] , and delivered him out of their hand , and said , Let us not take his life .
DARBY	Genesis	37	22	And Reuben said to them , Shed no blood : cast him into this pit which is in the wilderness ; but lay no hand upon him—in order that he might deliver him out of their hand , to bring him to his father again .
DARBY	Genesis	37	23	And it came to pass when Joseph came to his brethren , that they stripped Joseph of his vest , the vest of many colours , which he had on ;
DARBY	Genesis	37	24	and they took him and cast him into the pit ; now the pit was empty—there was no water in it .
DARBY	Genesis	37	25	And they sat down to eat bread ; and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and behold , a caravan of Ishmaelites came from Gilead ; and their camels bore tragacanth , and balsam , and ladanum—going to carry [ it ] down to Egypt .
DARBY	Genesis	37	26	And Judah said to his brethren , What profit is it that we kill our brother and secrete his blood ?
DARBY	Genesis	37	27	Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites ; but let not our hand be upon him ; for he is our brother , our flesh . And his brethren hearkened [ to him ] .
DARBY	Genesis	37	28	And Midianitish men , merchants , passed by ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty silver-pieces ; and they brought Joseph to Egypt .
DARBY	Genesis	37	29	And Reuben returned to the pit , and behold , Joseph [ was ] not in the pit ; and he rent his garments ,
DARBY	Genesis	37	30	and returned to his brethren , and said , The child is not ; and I , where shall I go ?
DARBY	Genesis	37	31	And they took Joseph 's vest , and slaughtered a buck of the goats , and dipped the vest in the blood ;
DARBY	Genesis	37	32	and they sent the vest of many colours and had it carried to their father , and said , This have we found : discern now whether it is thy son 's vest or not .
DARBY	Genesis	37	33	And he discerned it , and said , [ It is ] my son 's vest ! an evil beast has devoured him : Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces !
DARBY	Genesis	37	34	And Jacob rent his clothes , and put sackcloth on his loins , and mourned for his son many days .
DARBY	Genesis	37	35	And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him , but he refused to be comforted , and said , For I will go down to my son into Sheol mourning . Thus his father wept for him .
DARBY	Genesis	37	36	And the Midianites sold him into Egypt , to Potiphar , a chamberlain of Pharaoh , the captain of the life-guard .
DARBY	Genesis	38	38	And it came to pass at that time , that Judah went down from his brethren , and turned in to a man of Adullam whose name was Hirah .
DARBY	Genesis	38	2	And Judah saw there the daughter of a Canaanitish man whose name was Shua ; and he took her , and went in to her .
DARBY	Genesis	38	3	And she conceived and bore a son ; and he called his name Er .
DARBY	Genesis	38	4	And she again conceived and bore a son , and she called his name Onan .
DARBY	Genesis	38	5	And again she bore a son , and she called his name Shelah ; and he was at Chezib when she bore him .
DARBY	Genesis	38	6	And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn , and her name was Tamar .
DARBY	Genesis	38	7	And Er , Judah 's firstborn , was wicked in the sight of Jehovah , and Jehovah slew him .
DARBY	Genesis	38	8	Then Judah said to Onan , Go in to thy brother 's wife , and fulfil to her the brother-in-law 's duty , and raise up seed to thy brother .
DARBY	Genesis	38	9	But when Onan knew that the seed should not be his own , it came to pass when he went in to his brother 's wife , that he spilled [ it ] on the ground , in order to give no seed to his brother .
DARBY	Genesis	38	10	And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah , and he slew him also .
DARBY	Genesis	38	11	And Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law , Remain a widow in thy father 's house , until Shelah my son is grown ; for he said , Lest he die also , as his brethren . And Tamar went and remained in her father 's house .
DARBY	Genesis	38	12	And as the days were multiplied , Judah 's wife , the daughter of Shua , died . And Judah was comforted , and he went up to his sheep-shearers , to Timnah , he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite .
DARBY	Genesis	38	13	And it was told Tamar , saying , Behold thy father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep .
DARBY	Genesis	38	14	And she put the garments of her widowhood off from her , and covered herself with a veil , and wrapped herself , and sat in the entry of Enaim , which is on the way to Timnah ; for she saw that Shelah was grown , and she was not given to him as wife .
DARBY	Genesis	38	15	And Judah saw her , and took her for a harlot ; because she had covered her face .
DARBY	Genesis	38	16	And he turned aside to her by the way , and said , Come , I pray thee , let me go in to thee ; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law . And she said , What wilt thou give me , that thou mayest come in to me ?
DARBY	Genesis	38	17	And he said , I will send [ thee ] a kid of the goats from the flock . And she said , Wilt thou give [ me ] a pledge , until thou send it ?
DARBY	Genesis	38	18	And he said , What pledge shall I give thee ? And she said , Thy signet , and thy lace , and thy staff which is in thy hand . And he gave [ it ] her , and went in to her ; and she conceived by him .
DARBY	Genesis	38	19	And she arose and went away ; and she laid by her veil from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
DARBY	Genesis	38	20	And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite , to receive the pledge from the woman 's hand ; but he found her not .
DARBY	Genesis	38	21	And he asked the men of her place , saying , Where is the prostitute that was at Enaim , by the way-side ? And they said , There was no prostitute here .
DARBY	Genesis	38	22	And he returned to Judah , and said , I have not found her ; and also the men of the place said , No prostitute has been here .
DARBY	Genesis	38	23	Then Judah said , Let her take [ it ] for herself , lest we be put to shame . Behold , I sent this kid , and thou hast not found her .
DARBY	Genesis	38	24	And it came to pass about three months after , that it was told Judah , saying , Tamar thy daughter-in-law has committed fornication , and behold , she is also with child by fornication . And Judah said , Bring her forth , that she may be burned .
DARBY	Genesis	38	25	When she was brought forth , she sent to her father-in-law , saying , By the man to whom these [ belong ] am I with child ; and she said , Acknowledge , I pray thee , whose are this signet , and this lace , and this staff .
DARBY	Genesis	38	26	And Judah acknowledged [ them ] , and said , She is more righteous than I , because I have not given her to Shelah my son . And he knew her again no more .
DARBY	Genesis	38	27	And it came to pass at the time of her delivery , that behold , twins were in her womb .
DARBY	Genesis	38	28	And it came to pass when she brought forth , that one stretched out [ his ] hand , and the midwife took it and bound round his hand a scarlet thread , saying , This came out first .
DARBY	Genesis	38	29	And it came to pass as he drew back his hand , that behold , his brother came out ; and she said , How hast thou broken forth ! on thee be the breach ! And they called his name Pherez .
DARBY	Genesis	38	30	And afterwards came out his brother , round whose hand was the scarlet thread ; and they called his name Zerah .
DARBY	Genesis	39	39	And Joseph was brought down to Egypt ; and Potiphar , a chamberlain of Pharaoh , the captain of the life-guard , an Egyptian , bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites who had brought him down thither .
DARBY	Genesis	39	2	And Jehovah was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
DARBY	Genesis	39	3	And his master saw that Jehovah was with him , and that Jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand .
DARBY	Genesis	39	4	And Joseph found favour in his eyes , and attended on him ; and he set him over his house , and all that he had he gave into his hand .
DARBY	Genesis	39	5	And it came to pass from the time he had set him over his house and all that he had , that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian 's house for Joseph 's sake ; and the blessing of Jehovah was on all that he had in the house and in the field .
DARBY	Genesis	39	6	And he left all that he had in Joseph 's hand , and took cognizance of nothing with him , save the bread that he ate . And Joseph was of a beautiful form and of a beautiful countenance .
DARBY	Genesis	39	7	And it came to pass after these things , that his master 's wife cast her eyes on Joseph , and said , Lie with me !
DARBY	Genesis	39	8	But he refused , and said to his master 's wife , Behold , my master takes cognizance of nothing with me : what is in the house , and all that he has , he has given into my hand .
DARBY	Genesis	39	9	There is none greater in this house than I ; neither has he withheld anything from me but thee , because thou art his wife ; and how should I do this great wickedness , and sin against God ?
DARBY	Genesis	39	10	And it came to pass as she spoke to Joseph day by day and he hearkened not to her , to lie with her [ and ] to be with her ,
DARBY	Genesis	39	11	that on a certain day he went into the house to do his business , and there was none of the men of the house there in the house .
DARBY	Genesis	39	12	Then she caught him by his garment , saying , Lie with me ! But he left his garment in her hand , and fled and ran out .
DARBY	Genesis	39	13	And it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled forth ,
DARBY	Genesis	39	14	that she called to the men of her house , and spoke to them , saying , See , he has brought in a Hebrew man to us , to mock us : he came in to me , to lie with me ; and I cried with a loud voice ;
DARBY	Genesis	39	15	and it came to pass when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled and went out .
DARBY	Genesis	39	16	And she laid his garment by her until his lord came home .
DARBY	Genesis	39	17	And she spoke to him according to these words , saying , The Hebrew bondman that thou hast brought to us came in to me to mock me ;
DARBY	Genesis	39	18	and it came to pass as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled forth .
DARBY	Genesis	39	19	And it came to pass when his lord heard the words of his wife which she spoke to him , saying , After this manner did thy bondman to me , that his wrath was kindled .
DARBY	Genesis	39	20	And Joseph 's lord took him and put him into the tower-house , [ the ] place where the king 's prisoners were confined ; and he was there in the tower-house .
DARBY	Genesis	39	21	And Jehovah was with Joseph , and extended mercy to him , and gave him favour in the eyes of the chief of the tower-house .
DARBY	Genesis	39	22	And the chief of the tower-house committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners that were in the tower-house ; and whatever they had to do there he did .
DARBY	Genesis	39	23	The chief of the tower-house looked not to anything under his hand , because Jehovah was with him ; and what he did , Jehovah made it prosper .
DARBY	Genesis	40	40	And it came to pass after these things , [ that ] the cup-bearer of the king of Egypt and the baker offended their lord the king of Egypt .
DARBY	Genesis	40	2	And Pharaoh was wroth with his two chamberlains—with the chief of the cup-bearers and with the chief of the bakers ;
DARBY	Genesis	40	3	and he put them in custody into the house of the captain of the life-guard , into the tower-house , into the place where Joseph was imprisoned .
DARBY	Genesis	40	4	And the captain of the life-guard appointed Joseph to them , that he should attend on them . And they were [ several ] days in custody .
DARBY	Genesis	40	5	And they dreamed a dream , both of them in one night , each his dream , each according to the interpretation of his dream , the cup-bearer and the baker of the king of Egypt , who were imprisoned in the tower-house .
DARBY	Genesis	40	6	And Joseph came in to them in the morning , and looked on them , and behold , they were sad .
DARBY	Genesis	40	7	And he asked Pharaoh 's chamberlains that were with him in custody in his lord 's house , saying , Why are your faces [ so ] sad to-day ?
DARBY	Genesis	40	8	And they said to him , We have dreamt a dream , and there is no interpreter of it . And Joseph said to them , [ Do ] not interpretations [ belong ] to God ? tell me [ your dreams ] , I pray you .
DARBY	Genesis	40	9	Then the chief of the cup-bearers told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , In my dream , behold , a vine was before me ;
DARBY	Genesis	40	10	and in the vine were three branches ; and it was as though it budded : its blossoms shot forth , its clusters ripened into grapes .
DARBY	Genesis	40	11	And Pharaoh 's cup was in my hand ; and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Pharaoh 's cup , and gave the cup into Pharaoh 's hand .
DARBY	Genesis	40	12	And Joseph said to him , This is the interpretation of it : the three branches are three days .
DARBY	Genesis	40	13	In yet three days will Pharaoh lift up thy head and restore thee to thy place , and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh 's cup into his hand , after the former manner when thou wast his cup-bearer .
DARBY	Genesis	40	14	Only bear a remembrance with thee of me when it goes well with thee , and deal kindly , I pray thee , with me , and make mention of me to Pharaoh , and bring me out of this house ;
DARBY	Genesis	40	15	for indeed I was stolen out of the land of the Hebrews , and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon .
DARBY	Genesis	40	16	And when the chief of the bakers saw that the interpretation was good , he said to Joseph , I also was in my dream , and behold , three baskets of white bread were on my head .
DARBY	Genesis	40	17	And in the uppermost basket there were all manner of victuals for Pharaoh that the baker makes , and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head .
DARBY	Genesis	40	18	And Joseph answered and said , This is the interpretation of it : the three baskets are three days .
DARBY	Genesis	40	19	In yet three days will Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee , and hang thee on a tree ; and the birds will eat thy flesh from off thee .
DARBY	Genesis	40	20	And it came to pass the third day—Pharaoh 's birthday—that he made a feast to all his bondmen . And he lifted up the head of the chief of the cup-bearers , and the head of the chief of the bakers among his bondmen .
DARBY	Genesis	40	21	And he restored the chief of the cup-bearers to his office of cup-bearer again ; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh 's hand .
DARBY	Genesis	40	22	And he hanged the chief of the bakers , as Joseph had interpreted to them .
DARBY	Genesis	40	23	But the chief of the cup-bearers did not remember Joseph , and forgot him .
DARBY	Genesis	41	41	And Pharaoh said to Joseph , See , I have set thee over all the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Genesis	41	2	And behold , there came up out of the river seven kine , fine-looking and fat-fleshed , and they fed in the reed-grass .
DARBY	Genesis	41	3	And behold , seven other kine came up after them out of the river , bad-looking and lean-fleshed , and stood by the kine on the bank of the river .
DARBY	Genesis	41	4	And the kine that were bad-looking and lean-fleshed ate up the seven kine that were fine-looking and fat . And Pharaoh awoke .
DARBY	Genesis	41	5	And he slept and dreamed the second time ; and behold , seven ears of corn grew up on one stalk , fat and good .
DARBY	Genesis	41	6	And behold , seven ears , thin and parched with the east wind , sprung up after them .
DARBY	Genesis	41	7	And the thin ears devoured the seven fat and full ears . And Pharaoh awoke ; and behold , it was a dream .
DARBY	Genesis	41	8	And it came to pass in the morning , that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the scribes of Egypt , and all the sages who were therein , and Pharaoh told them his dream ; but [ there was ] none to interpret them to Pharaoh .
DARBY	Genesis	41	9	Then spoke the chief of the cup-bearers to Pharaoh , saying , I remember mine offences this day .
DARBY	Genesis	41	10	Pharaoh was wroth with his bondmen , and put me in custody into the captain of the life-guard 's house , me and the chief of the bakers .
DARBY	Genesis	41	11	And we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he ; we dreamed each according to the interpretation of his dream .
DARBY	Genesis	41	12	And there was there with us a Hebrew youth , a bondman of the captain of the life-guard , to whom we told [ them ] , and he interpreted to us our dreams ; to each he interpreted according to his dream .
DARBY	Genesis	41	13	And it came to pass , just as he interpreted to us , so it came about : me has he restored to my office , and him he hanged .
DARBY	Genesis	41	14	Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph ; and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon . And he shaved [ himself ] , and changed his clothes , and came in to Pharaoh .
DARBY	Genesis	41	15	And Pharaoh said to Joseph , I have dreamt a dream , and there is none to interpret it . And I have heard say of thee , thou understandest a dream to interpret it .
DARBY	Genesis	41	16	And Joseph answered Pharaoh , saying , It is not in me : God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace .
DARBY	Genesis	41	17	And Pharaoh said to Joseph , In my dream , behold , I stood on the bank of the river .
DARBY	Genesis	41	18	And behold , there came up out of the river seven kine , fat-fleshed and of fine form , and they fed in the reed-grass .
DARBY	Genesis	41	19	And behold , seven other kine came up after them , poor , and very ill-formed , and lean-fleshed—such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness .
DARBY	Genesis	41	20	And the lean and bad kine ate up the seven first fat kine ;
DARBY	Genesis	41	21	and they came into their belly , and it could not be known that they had come into their belly ; and their look was bad , as at the beginning . And I awoke .
DARBY	Genesis	41	22	And I saw in my dream , and behold , seven ears came up on one stalk , full and good .
DARBY	Genesis	41	23	And behold , seven ears , withered , thin , parched with the east wind , sprung up after them ;
DARBY	Genesis	41	24	and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears . And I told it to the scribes ; but there was none to make it known to me .
DARBY	Genesis	41	25	And Joseph said to Pharaoh , The dream of Pharaoh is one . What God will do he has made known to Pharaoh .
DARBY	Genesis	41	26	The seven fine kine are seven years ; and the seven good ears are seven years : the dream is one .
DARBY	Genesis	41	27	And the seven lean and bad kine that came up after them are seven years ; and the seven empty ears , parched with the east wind , will be seven years of famine .
DARBY	Genesis	41	28	This is the word which I have spoken to Pharaoh : what God is about to do he has let Pharaoh see .
DARBY	Genesis	41	29	Behold , there come seven years of great plenty throughout the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Genesis	41	30	And there will arise after them seven years of famine ; and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt , and the famine will waste away the land .
DARBY	Genesis	41	31	And the plenty will not be known afterwards in the land by reason of that famine ; for it will be very grievous .
DARBY	Genesis	41	32	And as regards the double repetition of the dream to Pharaoh , it is that the thing is established by God , and God will hasten to do it .
DARBY	Genesis	41	33	And now let Pharaoh look himself out a man discreet and wise , and set him over the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Genesis	41	34	Let Pharaoh do [ this ] : let him appoint overseers over the land , and take the fifth part of the land of Egypt during the seven years of plenty ,
DARBY	Genesis	41	35	and let them gather all the food of these coming good years , and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh , for food in the cities , and keep [ it ] .
DARBY	Genesis	41	36	And let the food be as store for the land for the seven years of famine , which will be in the land of Egypt , that the land perish not through the famine .
DARBY	Genesis	41	37	And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of all his bondmen .
DARBY	Genesis	41	38	And Pharaoh said to his bondmen , Shall we find [ one ] as this , a man in whom the Spirit of God is ?
DARBY	Genesis	41	39	And Pharaoh said to Joseph , Since God has made all this known to thee , there is none [ so ] discreet and wise as thou .
DARBY	Genesis	41	40	Thou shalt be over my house , and according to thy commandment shall all my people regulate themselves ; only concerning the throne will I be greater than thou .
DARBY	Genesis	41	42	And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand , and put it on Joseph 's hand , and arrayed him in clothes of byssus , and put a gold chain on his neck .
DARBY	Genesis	41	43	And he caused him to ride in the second chariot that he had ; and they cried before him , Bow the knee ! and he set him over all the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Genesis	41	44	And Pharaoh said to Joseph , I am Pharaoh ; and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Genesis	41	45	And Pharaoh called Joseph 's name Zaphnath-paaneah , and gave him as wife Asnath the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On . And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Genesis	41	46	And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt . And Joseph went out from Pharaoh , and passed through the whole land of Egypt .
DARBY	Genesis	41	47	And in the seven years of plenty the land brought forth by handfuls .
DARBY	Genesis	41	48	And he gathered up all the food of the seven years that was in the land of Egypt , and put the food in the cities ; the food of the fields of the city , which were round about it , he laid up in it .
DARBY	Genesis	41	49	And Joseph laid up corn as sand of the sea exceeding much , until they left off numbering ; for it was without number .
DARBY	Genesis	41	50	And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came , whom Asnath the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On bore to him .
DARBY	Genesis	41	51	And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh—For God has made me forget all my toil , and all my father 's house .
DARBY	Genesis	41	52	And the name of the second he called Ephraim—For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction .
DARBY	Genesis	41	53	And the seven years of plenty that were in the land of Egypt were ended ;
DARBY	Genesis	41	54	and the seven years of the dearth began to come , according as Joseph had said . And there was dearth in all lands ; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
DARBY	Genesis	41	55	And all the land of Egypt suffered from the dearth . And the people cried to Pharaoh for bread ; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians , Go to Joseph : what he says to you , that do .
DARBY	Genesis	41	56	And the famine was on all the earth . And Joseph opened every place in which there was [ provision ] , and sold grain to the Egyptians ; and the famine was grievous in the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Genesis	41	57	And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph , to buy [ grain ] , because the famine was grievous on the whole earth .
DARBY	Genesis	42	42	And Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt , and Jacob said to his sons , Why do ye look one upon another ?
DARBY	Genesis	42	2	And he said , Behold , I have heard that there is grain in Egypt ; go down thither and buy [ grain ] for us from thence , in order that we may live , and not die .
DARBY	Genesis	42	3	And Joseph 's ten brethren went down to buy [ grain ] out of Egypt .
DARBY	Genesis	42	4	But Benjamin , Joseph 's brother , Jacob sent not with his brethren ; for he said , Lest mischief may befall him .
DARBY	Genesis	42	5	So the sons of Israel came to buy [ grain ] among those that came ; for the famine was in the land of Canaan .
DARBY	Genesis	42	6	And Joseph , he was the governor over the land—he it was that sold [ the corn ] to all the people of the land . And Joseph 's brethren came and bowed down to him , the face to the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	42	7	And Joseph saw his brethren , and knew them ; but he made himself strange to them , and spoke roughly to them , and said to them , Whence come ye ? And they said , From the land of Canaan , to buy food .
DARBY	Genesis	42	8	And Joseph knew his brethren , but they did not know him .
DARBY	Genesis	42	9	And Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamt of them ; and he said to them , Ye are spies : to see the exposed places of the land ye are come .
DARBY	Genesis	42	10	And they said to him , No , my lord ; but to buy food are thy servants come .
DARBY	Genesis	42	11	We are all one man 's sons ; we are honest : thy servants are not spies .
DARBY	Genesis	42	12	And he said to them , No ; but to see the exposed places of the land are ye come .
DARBY	Genesis	42	13	And they said , Thy servants were twelve brethren , sons of one man , in the land of Canaan ; and behold , the youngest is this day with our father , and one is not .
DARBY	Genesis	42	14	And Joseph said to them , That is it that I have spoken to you , saying , Ye are spies .
DARBY	Genesis	42	15	By this ye shall be put to the proof : as Pharaoh lives , ye shall not go forth hence , unless your youngest brother come hither !
DARBY	Genesis	42	16	Send one of you , that he may fetch your brother , but ye shall be imprisoned , and your words shall be put to the proof , whether the truth is in you ; and if not , as Pharaoh lives , ye are spies .
DARBY	Genesis	42	17	And he put them in custody three days .
DARBY	Genesis	42	18	And Joseph said to them the third day , This do , that ye may live : I fear God .
DARBY	Genesis	42	19	If ye are honest , let one of your brethren remain bound in the house of your prison , but go ye , carry grain for the hunger of your households ;
DARBY	Genesis	42	20	and bring your youngest brother to me , in order that your words be verified , and that ye may not die . And they did so .
DARBY	Genesis	42	21	Then they said one to another , We are indeed guilty concerning our brother , whose anguish of soul we saw when he besought us , and we did not hearken ; therefore this distress is come upon us .
DARBY	Genesis	42	22	And Reuben answered them , saying , Did I not speak to you , saying , Do not sin against the lad ? But ye did not hearken ; and now behold , his blood also is required .
DARBY	Genesis	42	23	And they did not know that Joseph understood , for the interpreter was between them .
DARBY	Genesis	42	24	And he turned away from them , and wept . And he returned to them , and spoke to them , and took Simeon from among them , and bound him before their eyes .
DARBY	Genesis	42	25	And Joseph gave orders to fill their vessels with corn , and to restore every man 's money into his sack , and to give them provision for the way . And thus did they to them .
DARBY	Genesis	42	26	And they loaded their asses with their grain , and departed thence .
DARBY	Genesis	42	27	And one of them opened his sack to give his ass food in the inn , and saw his money , and behold , it was in the mouth of his sack .
DARBY	Genesis	42	28	And he said to his brethren , My money is returned [ to me ] , and behold , it is even in my sack . And their heart failed [ them ] , and they were afraid , saying one to another , What is this [ that ] God has done to us ?
DARBY	Genesis	42	29	And they came into the land of Canaan , to Jacob their father , and told him all that had befallen them , saying ,
DARBY	Genesis	42	30	The man , the lord of the land , spoke roughly to us , and treated us as spies of the land .
DARBY	Genesis	42	31	And we said to him , We are honest ; we are not spies :
DARBY	Genesis	42	32	we are twelve brethren , sons of our father ; one is not , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan .
DARBY	Genesis	42	33	And the man , the lord of the land , said to us , Hereby shall I know that ye are honest : leave one of your brethren with me , and take [ for ] the hunger of your households , and go ,
DARBY	Genesis	42	34	and bring your youngest brother to me , and I shall know that ye are not spies , but are honest . Your brother will I give up to you ; and ye may trade in the land .
DARBY	Genesis	42	35	And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks , that behold , every man had his bundle of money in his sack ; and they saw their bundles of money , they and their father , and were afraid .
DARBY	Genesis	42	36	And Jacob their father said to them , Ye have bereaved me of children : Joseph is not , and Simeon is not , and ye will take Benjamin ! All these things are against me .
DARBY	Genesis	42	37	And Reuben spoke to his father , saying , Slay my two sons if I bring him not back to thee : give him into my hand , and I will bring him to thee again .
DARBY	Genesis	42	38	But he said , My son shall not go down with you , for his brother is dead , and he alone is left ; and if mischief should befall him by the way in which ye go , then would ye bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to Sheol .
DARBY	Genesis	43	43	And the famine was grievous in the land .
DARBY	Genesis	43	2	And it came to pass , when they had finished eating the grain which they had brought from Egypt , that their father said to them , Go again , buy us a little food .
DARBY	Genesis	43	3	And Judah spoke to him , saying , The man did positively testify to us , saying , Ye shall not see my face , unless your brother be with you .
DARBY	Genesis	43	4	If thou wilt send our brother with us , we will go down and buy thee food ;
DARBY	Genesis	43	5	but if thou do not send [ him ] , we will not go down , for the man said to us , Ye shall not see my face , unless your brother be with you .
DARBY	Genesis	43	6	And Israel said , Why did ye deal [ so ] ill with me [ as ] to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother ?
DARBY	Genesis	43	7	And they said , The man asked very closely after us , and after our kindred , saying , Is your father yet alive ? have ye a brother ? And we told him according to the tenor of these words . Could we at all know that he would say , Bring your brother down ?
DARBY	Genesis	43	8	And Judah said to Israel his father , Send the lad with me , and we will arise and go , that we may live , and not die , both we and thou and our little ones .
DARBY	Genesis	43	9	I will be surety for him : of my hand shalt thou require him ; if I bring him not to thee , and set him before thy face , then shall I be guilty toward thee for ever .
DARBY	Genesis	43	10	For had we not lingered , we should now certainly have returned already twice .
DARBY	Genesis	43	11	And their father Israel said to them , If it is then so , do this : take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels , and carry down the man a gift : a little balsam and a little honey , tragacanth and ladanum , pistacia-nuts and almonds .
DARBY	Genesis	43	12	And take other money in your hand , and the money that was returned to you in the mouth of your sacks , carry back in your hand : perhaps it is an oversight .
DARBY	Genesis	43	13	And take your brother , and arise , go again to the man .
DARBY	Genesis	43	14	And the Almighty God give you mercy before the man , that he may send away your other brother and Benjamin ! And I , if I be bereaved of children , am bereaved .
DARBY	Genesis	43	15	And the men took that gift , and took double money in their hand , and Benjamin , and rose up , and went down to Egypt , and came before Joseph .
DARBY	Genesis	43	16	And Joseph saw Benjamin with them , and said to the [ man ] who was over his house , Bring the men into the house , and slaughter cattle , and make ready ; for the men shall eat with me at noon .
DARBY	Genesis	43	17	And the man did as Joseph had said ; and the man brought the men into Joseph 's house .
DARBY	Genesis	43	18	And the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph 's house , and said , Because of the money that was returned to us in our sacks at the beginning are we brought in , that he may turn against us , and fall upon us and take us for bondmen , and our asses .
DARBY	Genesis	43	19	And they came up to the man that was over Joseph 's house , and they spoke to him at the door of the house ,
DARBY	Genesis	43	20	and said , Ah ! my lord , we came indeed down at the first to buy food .
DARBY	Genesis	43	21	And it came to pass when we came to the inn , that we opened our sacks , and behold , [ every ] man 's money was in the mouth of his sack , our money according to its weight ; and we have brought it again in our hand .
DARBY	Genesis	43	22	And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food . We do not know who put our money in our sacks .
DARBY	Genesis	43	23	And he said , Peace be to you , fear not : your God , and the God of your father , has given you treasure in your sacks ; your money came to me . And he brought Simeon out to them .
DARBY	Genesis	43	24	And the man brought the men into Joseph 's house , and gave water , and they washed their feet ; and he gave their asses food .
DARBY	Genesis	43	25	And they made ready the gift for Joseph 's coming at noon ; for they had heard that they should eat bread there .
DARBY	Genesis	43	26	When Joseph came home , they brought him the gift that was in their hand , into the house , and bowed themselves to him to the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	43	27	And he asked them of their welfare , and said , Is your father well—the old man of whom ye spoke ? Is he yet alive ?
DARBY	Genesis	43	28	And they said , Thy servant our father is well ; he is yet alive . And they bowed , and made obeisance .
DARBY	Genesis	43	29	And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin , his mother 's son , and said , Is this your younger brother of whom ye spoke to me ? And he said , God be gracious to thee , my son !
DARBY	Genesis	43	30	And Joseph made haste , for his bowels burned for his brother ; and he sought [ a place ] to weep , and he went into the chamber , and wept there .
DARBY	Genesis	43	31	And he washed his face , and came out , and controlled himself , and said , Set on bread .
DARBY	Genesis	43	32	And they set on for him by himself , and for them by themselves , and for the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves ; because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews , for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians .
DARBY	Genesis	43	33	And they sat before him , the firstborn according to his birthright , and the youngest according to his youth ; and the men marvelled one at another .
DARBY	Genesis	43	34	And he had portions carried to them from before him . And Benjamin 's portion was five times greater than the portions of them all . And they drank , and made merry with him .
DARBY	Genesis	44	44	And he commanded him who was over his house , saying , Fill the men 's sacks with food , as much as they can carry ; and put every man 's money in the mouth of his sack .
DARBY	Genesis	44	2	And put my cup , the silver cup , in the mouth of the sack of the youngest , and his grain-money . And he did according to the word of Joseph which he had spoken .
DARBY	Genesis	44	3	In the morning , when it was light , the men were sent away , they and their asses .
DARBY	Genesis	44	4	They were gone out of the city , [ and ] not [ yet ] far off , when Joseph said to him who was over his house , Up ! follow after the men ; and when thou overtakest them , thou shalt say to them , Why have ye rewarded evil for good ?
DARBY	Genesis	44	5	Is not this [ it ] in which my lord drinks , and in which indeed he divines ? Ye have done evil [ in ] what ye have done .
DARBY	Genesis	44	6	And he overtook them , and he spoke to them these words .
DARBY	Genesis	44	7	And they said to him , Why does my lord speak such words as these ? Far be it from thy servants to do such a thing !
DARBY	Genesis	44	8	Behold , the money that we found in our sacks ' mouths we have brought again to thee from the land of Canaan ; and how should we steal out of thy lord 's house silver or gold ?
DARBY	Genesis	44	9	With whomsoever of thy servants it is found , let him die ; and we also will be my lord 's bondmen .
DARBY	Genesis	44	10	And he said , Now also [ let ] it [ be ] according to your words : let him with whom it is found be my bondman , but ye shall be blameless .
DARBY	Genesis	44	11	And they hasted and laid down every man his sack on the ground , and opened every man his sack .
DARBY	Genesis	44	12	And he searched carefully : he began at the eldest , and ended at the youngest ; and the cup was found in Benjamin 's sack .
DARBY	Genesis	44	13	Then they rent their clothes , and loaded every man his ass , and they returned to the city .
DARBY	Genesis	44	14	And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph 's house ; and he was still there ; and they fell down before him to the ground .
DARBY	Genesis	44	15	And Joseph said to them , What deed is this which ye have done ? Did ye not know that such a man as I can certainly divine ?
DARBY	Genesis	44	16	And Judah said , What shall we say to my lord ? what shall we speak , and how justify ourselves ? God has found out the iniquity of thy servants ; behold , we are my lord 's bondmen , both we , and he in whose hand the cup has been found .
DARBY	Genesis	44	17	And he said , Far be it from me to do so ! The man in whose hand the cup has been found , he shall be my bondman ; but as for you , go up in peace to your father .
DARBY	Genesis	44	18	Then Judah came near to him , and said , Ah ! my lord , let thy servant , I pray thee , speak a word in my lord 's ears , and let not thine anger burn against thy servant ; for thou art even as Pharaoh .
DARBY	Genesis	44	19	My lord asked his servants , saying , Have ye a father , or a brother ?
DARBY	Genesis	44	20	And we said to my lord , We have an aged father , and a child born to him in his old age , [ yet ] young ; and his brother is dead , and he alone is left of his mother ; and his father loves him .
DARBY	Genesis	44	21	And thou saidst unto thy servants , Bring him down to me , that I may set mine eye on him .
DARBY	Genesis	44	22	And we said to my lord , The youth can not leave his father : if he should leave his father , [ his father ] would die .
DARBY	Genesis	44	23	And thou saidst to thy servants , Unless your youngest brother come down with you , ye shall see my face no more .
DARBY	Genesis	44	24	And it came to pass when we came up to thy servant my father , we told him the words of my lord .
DARBY	Genesis	44	25	And our father said , Go again , buy us a little food .
DARBY	Genesis	44	26	But we said , We can not go down : if our youngest brother be with us , then will we go down ; for we can not see the man 's face unless our youngest brother is with us .
DARBY	Genesis	44	27	And thy servant my father said to us , Ye know that my wife bore me two [ sons ] ;
DARBY	Genesis	44	28	and the one went out from me , and I said , He must certainly have been torn in pieces ; and I have not seen him [ again ] hitherto .
DARBY	Genesis	44	29	And if ye take this one also from me , and mischief should befall him , ye will bring down my grey hairs with misery to Sheol .
DARBY	Genesis	44	30	And now , when I come to thy servant my father , and the lad is not with us , —seeing that his life is bound up with his life ,
DARBY	Genesis	44	31	it will come to pass when he sees that the lad is not [ there ] , that he will die ; and thy servants will bring down the grey hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol .
DARBY	Genesis	44	32	For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father , saying , If I bring him not to thee , then I shall be guilty toward my father all my days .
DARBY	Genesis	44	33	And now , let thy servant stay , I pray thee , instead of the lad a bondman to my lord , and let the lad go up with his brethren ;
DARBY	Genesis	44	34	for how should I go up to my father if the lad were not with me ? —lest I see the evil that would come on my father .
DARBY	Genesis	45	45	And Joseph could not control himself before all them that stood by him , and he cried , Put every man out from me ! And no man stood with him when Joseph made himself known to his brethren .
DARBY	Genesis	45	2	And he raised his voice in weeping ; and the Egyptians heard , and the house of Pharaoh heard .
DARBY	Genesis	45	3	And Joseph said to his brethren , I am Joseph . Does my father yet live ? And his brethren could not answer him , for they were troubled at his presence .
DARBY	Genesis	45	4	And Joseph said to his brethren , Come near to me , I pray you . And they came near . And he said , I am Joseph your brother , whom ye sold into Egypt .
DARBY	Genesis	45	5	And now , be not grieved , and be not angry with yourselves , that ye sold me hither , for God sent me before you to preserve life .
DARBY	Genesis	45	6	For the famine has been these two years in the land ; and yet there are five years in which there will be neither ploughing nor harvest .
DARBY	Genesis	45	7	So God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth , and to save you alive by a great deliverance .
DARBY	Genesis	45	8	And now it was not you [ that ] sent me here , but God ; and he has made me a father to Pharaoh , and lord of all his house , and governor over all the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Genesis	45	9	Haste and go up to my father , and say to him , Thus says thy son Joseph : God has made me lord of all Egypt ; come down to me , tarry not .
DARBY	Genesis	45	10	And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen , and thou shalt be near to me , thou , and thy sons , and thy sons ' sons , and thy sheep , and thy cattle , and all that thou hast .
DARBY	Genesis	45	11	And there will I maintain thee ; for yet there are five years of famine ; in order that thou be not impoverished , thou , and thy household , and all that thou hast .
DARBY	Genesis	45	12	And behold , your eyes see , and the eyes of my brother Benjamin , that it is my mouth which speaks to you .
DARBY	Genesis	45	13	And tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that ye have seen , and haste and bring down my father hither .
DARBY	Genesis	45	14	And he fell on his brother Benjamin 's neck , and wept ; and Benjamin wept on his neck .
DARBY	Genesis	45	15	And he kissed all his brethren , and wept upon them ; and after that his brethren talked with him .
DARBY	Genesis	45	16	And the report was heard in Pharaoh 's house , saying , Joseph 's brethren are come . And it was good in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of his bondmen .
DARBY	Genesis	45	17	And Pharaoh said to Joseph , Say to thy brethren , Do this : load your beasts and depart , go into the land of Canaan ,
DARBY	Genesis	45	18	and take your father and your households , and come to me ; and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and ye shall eat the fat of the land .
DARBY	Genesis	45	19	And thou art commanded—this do : take waggons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives , and take up your father , and come .
DARBY	Genesis	45	20	And let not your eye regret your stuff ; for the good of all the land of Egypt shall be yours .
DARBY	Genesis	45	21	And the sons of Israel did so ; and Joseph gave them waggons , according to the commandment of Pharaoh , and gave them provision for the way .
DARBY	Genesis	45	22	To each one of them all he gave changes of clothing ; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred [ pieces ] of silver and five changes of clothing .
DARBY	Genesis	45	23	And to his father he sent this : ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt , and ten she-asses laden with corn and bread , and food for his father by the way .
DARBY	Genesis	45	24	And he sent his brethren away , and they departed . And he said to them , Do not quarrel on the way .
DARBY	Genesis	45	25	And they went up out of Egypt , and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father .
DARBY	Genesis	45	26	And they told him , saying , Joseph is still alive , and he is governor over all the land of Egypt . And his heart fainted , for he did not believe them .
DARBY	Genesis	45	27	And they spoke to him all the words of Joseph , which he had spoken to them . And he saw the waggons that Joseph had sent to carry him . And the spirit of Jacob their father revived .
DARBY	Genesis	45	28	And Israel said , It is enough : Joseph my son is yet alive ; I will go and see him before I die .
DARBY	Genesis	46	46	And Israel took his journey with all that he had , and came to Beer-sheba ; and he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac .
DARBY	Genesis	46	2	And God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night and said , Jacob , Jacob ! And he said , Here am I .
DARBY	Genesis	46	3	And he said , I am God , the God of thy father : fear not to go down to Egypt ; for I will there make of thee a great nation .
DARBY	Genesis	46	4	I will go down with thee to Egypt , and I will also certainly bring thee up ; and Joseph shall put his hand on thine eyes .
DARBY	Genesis	46	5	And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba ; and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father , and their little ones , and their wives , on the waggons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him .
DARBY	Genesis	46	6	And they took their cattle , and their goods which they had acquired in the land of Canaan , and came to Egypt , Jacob and all his seed with him ;
DARBY	Genesis	46	7	his sons and his sons ' sons with him , his daughters and his sons ' daughters and all his seed he brought with him to Egypt .
DARBY	Genesis	46	8	And these are the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt : Jacob and his sons . Jacob 's firstborn , Reuben .
DARBY	Genesis	46	9	And the sons of Reuben : Enoch , and Phallu , and Hezron , and Carmi .
DARBY	Genesis	46	10	—And the sons of Simeon : Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Saul the son of a Canaanitish woman .
DARBY	Genesis	46	11	—And the sons of Levi : Gershon , Kohath , and Merari .
DARBY	Genesis	46	12	—And the sons of Judah : Er , and Onan , and Shelah , and Pherez , and Zerah ; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan . And the sons of Pherez were Hezron and Hamul .
DARBY	Genesis	46	13	—And the sons of Issachar : Tola , and Puah , and Job , and Shimron .
DARBY	Genesis	46	14	—And the sons of Zebulun : Sered , and Elon , and Jahleel .
DARBY	Genesis	46	15	—These are the sons of Leah , whom she bore to Jacob in Padan-Aram ; and his daughter , Dinah . All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three .
DARBY	Genesis	46	16	And the sons of Gad : Ziphion and Haggi , Shuni and Ezbon , Eri , and Arodi , and Areli .
DARBY	Genesis	46	17	—And the sons of Asher : Jimnah , and Jishvah , and Jishvi , and Beriah ; and Serah their sister ; and the sons of Beriah : Heber and Malchiel .
DARBY	Genesis	46	18	—These are the sons of Zilpah , whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter ; and she bore these to Jacob : sixteen souls .
DARBY	Genesis	46	19	The sons of Rachel Jacob 's wife : Joseph and Benjamin .
DARBY	Genesis	46	20	And to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim , whom Asnath bore to him , the daughter of Potipherah the priest in On .
DARBY	Genesis	46	21	—And the sons of Benjamin : Belah , and Becher , and Ashbel , Gera and Naaman , Ehi and Rosh , Muppim , and Huppim , and Ard .
DARBY	Genesis	46	22	—These are the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob : all the souls were fourteen .
DARBY	Genesis	46	23	And the sons of Dan : Hushim .
DARBY	Genesis	46	24	—And the sons of Naphtali : Jahzeel , and Guni , and Jezer , and Shillem .
DARBY	Genesis	46	25	—These are the sons of Bilhah , whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter ; and she bore these to Jacob : all the souls were seven .
DARBY	Genesis	46	26	All the souls that came with Jacob to Egypt , that had come out of his loins , besides Jacob 's sons ' wives : all the souls were sixty-six .
DARBY	Genesis	46	27	And the sons of Joseph who were born to him in Egypt , were two souls . All the souls of the house of Jacob that came to Egypt were seventy .
DARBY	Genesis	46	28	And he sent Judah before him to Joseph , to give notice before he came to Goshen . And they came into the land of Goshen .
DARBY	Genesis	46	29	Then Joseph yoked his chariot , and went up to meet Israel his father , to Goshen , and he presented himself to him ; and he fell on his neck , and wept on his neck a good while .
DARBY	Genesis	46	30	And Israel said to Joseph , Now let me die , after I have seen thy face , since thou still livest .
DARBY	Genesis	46	31	And Joseph said to his brethren and to his father 's house , I will go up , and tell Pharaoh , and say to him , My brethren and my father 's house , who were in the land of Canaan , are come to me ;
DARBY	Genesis	46	32	and the men are shepherds , for they have been occupied with cattle ; and they have brought their sheep , and their cattle , and all that they have .
DARBY	Genesis	46	33	And it shall come to pass that when Pharaoh shall call you and say , What is your occupation ?
DARBY	Genesis	46	34	then ye shall say , Thy servants are men that have been occupied with cattle from our youth even until now , both we and our fathers ; in order that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen ; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians .
DARBY	Genesis	47	47	And Joseph came and told Pharaoh and said , My father and my brethren , and their sheep and their cattle , and all that they have , are come out of the land of Canaan ; and behold , they are in the land of Goshen .
DARBY	Genesis	47	2	And he took from the whole number of his brethren , five men , and set them before Pharaoh .
DARBY	Genesis	47	3	And Pharaoh said to his brethren , What is your occupation ? And they said to Pharaoh , Thy servants are shepherds , both we and our fathers .
DARBY	Genesis	47	4	And they said to Pharaoh , To sojourn in the land are we come ; for there is no pasture for the sheep that thy servants have , for the famine is grievous in the land of Canaan ; and now , we pray thee , let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen .
DARBY	Genesis	47	5	And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph , saying , Thy father and thy brethren are come to thee .
DARBY	Genesis	47	6	The land of Egypt is before thee ; in the best of the land settle thy father and thy brethren : let them dwell in the land of Goshen . And if thou knowest men of activity among them , then set them as overseers of cattle over what I have .
DARBY	Genesis	47	7	And Joseph brought Jacob his father , and set him before Pharaoh . And Jacob blessed Pharaoh .
DARBY	Genesis	47	8	And Pharaoh said to Jacob , How many are the days of the years of thy life ?
DARBY	Genesis	47	9	And Jacob said to Pharaoh , The days of the years of my sojourning are a hundred and thirty years . Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life , and they do not attain to the days of the years of the life of my fathers , in the days of their sojourning .
DARBY	Genesis	47	10	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh , and went out from Pharaoh .
DARBY	Genesis	47	11	And Joseph settled his father and his brethren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
DARBY	Genesis	47	12	And Joseph maintained his father , and his brethren , and all his father 's household , with bread , according to the number of the little ones .
DARBY	Genesis	47	13	And there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very grievous ; and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan were exhausted through the famine .
DARBY	Genesis	47	14	And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Canaan , for the grain which they bought ; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh 's house .
DARBY	Genesis	47	15	And when money came to an end in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan , all the Egyptians came to Joseph , saying , Give us bread ! for why should we die before thee ? for [ our ] money is all gone .
DARBY	Genesis	47	16	And Joseph said , Give your cattle , and I will give you for your cattle , if [ your ] money be all gone .
DARBY	Genesis	47	17	And they brought their cattle to Joseph ; and Joseph gave them bread for horses , and for flocks of sheep , and for herds of cattle , and for asses ; and he fed them with bread for all their cattle that year .
DARBY	Genesis	47	18	And that year ended ; and they came to him the second year , and said to him , We will not hide [ it ] from my lord that since [ our ] money is come to an end , and the herds of cattle are in the possession of my lord , nothing is left before my lord but our bodies and our land .
DARBY	Genesis	47	19	Why should we die before thine eyes , both we and our land ? Buy us and our land for bread , and we and our land will be bondmen to Pharaoh ; and give seed , that we may live , and not die , and that the land be not desolate .
DARBY	Genesis	47	20	And Joseph bought all the soil of Egypt for Pharaoh ; for the Egyptians sold every man his field , because the famine prevailed over them ; and the land became Pharaoh 's .
DARBY	Genesis	47	21	And as for the people , he removed them into the cities , from [ one ] end of the borders of Egypt even to the [ other ] end of it .
DARBY	Genesis	47	22	Only the land of the priests he did not buy ; for the priests had an assigned portion from Pharaoh , and ate their assigned portion which Pharaoh had given them ; so they did not sell their land .
DARBY	Genesis	47	23	And Joseph said to the people , Behold , I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh : lo , here is seed for you , and sow the land .
DARBY	Genesis	47	24	And it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give the fifth to Pharaoh , and the four parts shall be your own , for seed of the field , and for your food , and for them of your households , and for food for your little ones .
DARBY	Genesis	47	25	And they said , Thou hast saved us alive . Let us find favour in the eyes of my lord , and we will be Pharaoh 's bondmen .
DARBY	Genesis	47	26	And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt to this day , [ that ] the fifth should be for Pharaoh , except the land of the priests : theirs alone did not become Pharaoh 's .
DARBY	Genesis	47	27	And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt , in the land of Goshen ; and they had possessions in it , and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly .
DARBY	Genesis	47	28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years ; and the days of Jacob , the years of his life , were a hundred and forty-seven years .
DARBY	Genesis	47	29	And the days of Israel approached that he should die . And he called his son Joseph , and said to him , If now I have found favour in thine eyes , put , I pray thee , thy hand under my thigh , and deal kindly and truly with me : bury me not , I pray thee , in Egypt ;
DARBY	Genesis	47	30	but when I shall lie with my fathers , thou shalt carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their sepulchre . And he said , I will do according to thy word .
DARBY	Genesis	47	31	And he said , Swear to me ; and he swore to him . And Israel worshipped on the bed 's head .
DARBY	Genesis	48	48	And it came to pass after these things , that one told Joseph , Behold , thy father is sick . And he took with him his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim .
DARBY	Genesis	48	2	And one told Jacob and said , Behold , thy son Joseph is coming to thee . And Israel strengthened himself , and sat upon the bed .
DARBY	Genesis	48	3	And Jacob said to Joseph , The Almighty God appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan , and blessed me ,
DARBY	Genesis	48	4	and he said to me , Behold , I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee , and I will make of thee a company of peoples ; and will give this land to thy seed after thee [ for ] an everlasting possession .
DARBY	Genesis	48	5	And now thy two sons , who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came to thee into Egypt , shall be mine : Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine , as Reuben and Simeon .
DARBY	Genesis	48	6	And thy family which thou hast begotten after them shall be thine : they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance .
DARBY	Genesis	48	7	And as for me , when I came from Padan , Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan on the way , when there was yet a certain distance to come to Ephrath ; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath , that is , Bethlehem .
DARBY	Genesis	48	8	And Israel beheld Joseph 's sons , and said , Who are these ?
DARBY	Genesis	48	9	And Joseph said to his father , They are my sons , whom God has given me here . And he said , Bring them , I pray thee , to me , that I may bless them .
DARBY	Genesis	48	10	But the eyes of Israel were heavy from age : he could not see . And he brought them nearer to him ; and he kissed them , and embraced them .
DARBY	Genesis	48	11	And Israel said to Joseph , I had not thought to see thy face ; and behold , God has let me see also thy seed .
DARBY	Genesis	48	12	And Joseph brought them out from his knees , and bowed down with his face to the earth .
DARBY	Genesis	48	13	And Joseph took them both , Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought [ them ] near to him .
DARBY	Genesis	48	14	But Israel stretched out his right hand , and laid [ it ] on Ephraim 's head—now he was the younger—and his left hand on Manasseh 's head ; guiding his hands intelligently , for Manasseh was the firstborn .
DARBY	Genesis	48	15	And he blessed Joseph , and said , The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked , the God that shepherded me all my life long to this day ,
DARBY	Genesis	48	16	the Angel that redeemed me from all evil , bless the lads ; and let my name be named upon them , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac ; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the land !
DARBY	Genesis	48	17	When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim , it was evil in his eyes ; and he took hold of his father 's hand to remove it from Ephraim 's head to Manasseh 's head .
DARBY	Genesis	48	18	And Joseph said to his father , Not so , my father , for this is the firstborn : put thy right hand on his head .
DARBY	Genesis	48	19	But his father refused and said , I know , my son , I know : he also will become a people , and he also will be great ; but truly his younger brother will be greater than he ; and his seed will become the fulness of nations .
DARBY	Genesis	48	20	And he blessed them that day , saying , In thee will Israel bless , saying , God make thee as Ephraim and Manasseh ! And he set Ephraim before Manasseh .
DARBY	Genesis	48	21	And Israel said to Joseph , Behold , I die ; and God will be with you , and bring you again to the land of your fathers .
DARBY	Genesis	48	22	And * I * have given to thee one tract [ of land ] above thy brethren , which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow .
DARBY	Genesis	49	49	And Jacob called his sons , and said , Gather yourselves together , and I will tell you what will befall you at the end of days .
DARBY	Genesis	49	2	Assemble yourselves , and hear , ye sons of Jacob , And listen to Israel your father .
DARBY	Genesis	49	3	Reuben , thou art my firstborn , My might , and the firstfruits of my vigour : Excellency of dignity , and excellency of strength .
DARBY	Genesis	49	4	Impetuous as the waters , thou shalt have no pre-eminence ; Because thou wentest up to thy father 's couch : Then defiledst thou [ it ] : he went up to my bed .
DARBY	Genesis	49	5	Simeon and Levi are brethren : Instruments of violence their swords .
DARBY	Genesis	49	6	My soul , come not into their council ; Mine honour , be not united with their assembly ; For in their anger they slew men , And in their wantonness houghed oxen .
DARBY	Genesis	49	7	Cursed be their anger , for it [ was ] violent ; And their rage , for it [ was ] cruel ! I will divide them in Jacob , And scatter them in Israel .
DARBY	Genesis	49	8	Judah— [ as to ] thee , thy brethren will praise thee ; Thy hand will be upon the neck of thine enemies ; Thy father 's children will bow down to thee .
DARBY	Genesis	49	9	Judah is a young lion ; From the prey , my son , thou art gone up . He stoopeth , he layeth himself down as a lion , And as a lioness : who will rouse him up ?
DARBY	Genesis	49	10	The scepter will not depart from Judah , Nor the lawgiver from between his feet , Until Shiloh come , And to him will be the obedience of peoples .
DARBY	Genesis	49	11	He bindeth his foal to the vine , And his ass 's colt to the choice vine ; He washeth his dress in wine , And his garment in the blood of grapes .
DARBY	Genesis	49	12	The eyes are red with wine , And the teeth [ are ] white with milk .
DARBY	Genesis	49	13	Zebulun will dwell at the shore of the seas ; Yea , he will be at the shore of the ships , And his side [ toucheth ] upon Sidon .
DARBY	Genesis	49	14	Issachar is a bony ass , Crouching down between two hurdles .
DARBY	Genesis	49	15	And he saw the rest that it was good , And the land that it was pleasant ; And he bowed his shoulder to bear , And was a tributary servant .
DARBY	Genesis	49	16	Dan will judge his people , As another of the tribes of Israel .
DARBY	Genesis	49	17	Dan will be a serpent on the way , A horned snake on the path , Which biteth the horse 's heels , So that the rider falleth backwards .
DARBY	Genesis	49	18	I wait for thy salvation , O Jehovah .
DARBY	Genesis	49	19	Gad—troops will rush upon him ; But he will rush upon the heel .
DARBY	Genesis	49	20	Out of Asher , his bread shall be fat , And he will give royal dainties .
DARBY	Genesis	49	21	Naphtali is a hind let loose ; He giveth goodly words .
DARBY	Genesis	49	22	Joseph is a fruitful bough ; A fruitful bough by a well ; [ His ] branches shoot over the wall .
DARBY	Genesis	49	23	The archers have provoked him , And shot at , and hated him ;
DARBY	Genesis	49	24	But his bow abideth firm , And the arms of his hands are supple By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob . From thence is the shepherd , the stone of Israel :
DARBY	Genesis	49	25	From the God of thy father , and he will help thee ; And from the Almighty , and he will bless thee—With blessings of heaven from above , With blessings of the deep that lieth under , With blessings of the breast and of the womb .
DARBY	Genesis	49	26	The blessings of thy father surpass the blessings of my ancestors , Unto the bounds of the everlasting hills : They shall be on the head of Joseph , And on the crown of the head of him that was separated from his brethren .
DARBY	Genesis	49	27	Benjamin— [ as ] a wolf will he tear to pieces ; In the morning he will devour the prey , And in the evening he will divide the booty .
DARBY	Genesis	49	28	All these are the twelve tribes of Israel , and this is what their father spoke to them ; and he blessed them : every one according to his blessing he blessed them .
DARBY	Genesis	49	29	And he charged them , and said to them , I am gathered to my people : bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite ,
DARBY	Genesis	49	30	in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah , which is opposite to Mamre , in the land of Canaan , which Abraham bought of Ephron the Hittite along with the field for a possession of a sepulchre .
DARBY	Genesis	49	31	There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife ; there they buried Isaac and Rebecca his wife ; and there I buried Leah .
DARBY	Genesis	49	32	The purchase of the field , and of the cave that is in it , was from the children of Heth .
DARBY	Genesis	49	33	And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered his feet into the bed , and expired , and was gathered to his peoples .
DARBY	Genesis	50	50	And Joseph fell upon his father 's face , and wept upon him , and kissed him .
DARBY	Genesis	50	2	And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father . And the physicians embalmed Israel .
DARBY	Genesis	50	3	And forty days were fulfilled for him ; for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed . And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days .
DARBY	Genesis	50	4	And when the days of his mourning were past , Joseph spoke to the house of Pharaoh , saying , If now I have found favour in your eyes , speak , I pray you , in the ears of Pharaoh , saying ,
DARBY	Genesis	50	5	My father made me swear , saying , Behold , I die ; in my grave which I have dug myself in the land of Canaan , there shalt thou bury me . And now , let me go up , I pray thee , that I may bury my father ; and I will come again .
DARBY	Genesis	50	6	And Pharaoh said , Go up and bury thy father , according as he made thee swear .
DARBY	Genesis	50	7	And Joseph went up to bury his father ; and with him went up all the bondmen of Pharaoh , the elders of his house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
DARBY	Genesis	50	8	and all the house of Joseph , and his brethren , and his father 's house ; only their little ones , and their flocks , and their herds , they left in the land of Goshen .
DARBY	Genesis	50	9	And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen ; and the camp was very great .
DARBY	Genesis	50	10	And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad , which is beyond the Jordan ; and there they lamented with a great and very grievous lamentation ; and he made a mourning for his father of seven days .
DARBY	Genesis	50	11	And the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , saw the mourning at the threshing-floor of Atad , and they said , This is a grievous mourning of the Egyptians . Therefore the name of it was called Abel-Mizraim , which is beyond the Jordan .
DARBY	Genesis	50	12	And his sons did to him according as he had commanded them ;
DARBY	Genesis	50	13	and his sons carried him into the land of Canaan , and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah which Abraham had bought along with the field , for a possession of a sepulchre , of Ephron the Hittite , opposite to Mamre .
DARBY	Genesis	50	14	And , after he had buried his father , Joseph returned to Egypt , he and his brethren , and all that had gone up with him to bury his father .
DARBY	Genesis	50	15	And when Joseph 's brethren saw that their father was dead , they said , If now Joseph should be hostile to us , and should indeed requite us all the evil that we did to him !
DARBY	Genesis	50	16	And they sent a messenger to Joseph , saying , Thy father commanded before he died , saying ,
DARBY	Genesis	50	17	Thus shall ye speak to Joseph : Oh forgive , I pray thee , the transgression of thy brethren , and their sin ! for they did evil to thee . And now , we pray thee , forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father . And Joseph wept when they spoke to him .
DARBY	Genesis	50	18	And his brethren also went and fell down before his face , and said , Behold , we are thy bondmen .
DARBY	Genesis	50	19	And Joseph said to them , Fear not : am I then in the place of God ?
DARBY	Genesis	50	20	Ye indeed meant evil against me : God meant it for good , in order that he might do as [ it is ] this day , to save a great people alive .
DARBY	Genesis	50	21	And now , fear not : I will maintain you and your little ones . And he comforted them , and spoke consolingly to them .
DARBY	Genesis	50	22	And Joseph dwelt in Egypt , he and his father 's house ; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years .
DARBY	Genesis	50	23	And Joseph saw Ephraim 's children of the third [ generation ] ; the sons also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born on Joseph 's knees .
DARBY	Genesis	50	24	And Joseph said to his brethren , I die ; and God will certainly visit you , and bring you up out of this land , into the land that he swore unto Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
DARBY	Genesis	50	25	And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel , saying , God will certainly visit you ; and ye shall carry up my bones hence .
DARBY	Genesis	50	26	And Joseph died , a hundred and ten years old ; and they embalmed him ; and he was put in a coffin in Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	1	1	And these are the names of the sons of Israel who had come into Egypt ; with Jacob had they come , each with his household :
DARBY	Exodus	1	2	Reuben , Simeon , Levi , and Judah ;
DARBY	Exodus	1	3	Issachar , Zebulun , and Benjamin ;
DARBY	Exodus	1	4	Dan and Naphtali ; Gad and Asher .
DARBY	Exodus	1	5	And all the souls that had come out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls ; and Joseph was in Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	1	6	And Joseph died , and all his brethren , and all that generation .
DARBY	Exodus	1	7	And the children of Israel were fruitful , and swarmed and multiplied , and became exceeding strong ; and the land was full of them .
DARBY	Exodus	1	8	And there arose a new king over Egypt , who did not know Joseph .
DARBY	Exodus	1	9	And he said to his people , Behold , the people of the children of Israel are more numerous and stronger than we .
DARBY	Exodus	1	10	Come on , let us deal wisely with them , lest they multiply , and it come to pass that , if war occur , they take side with our enemies and fight against us , and go up out of the land .
DARBY	Exodus	1	11	And they set over them service-masters to oppress them with their burdens . And they built store-cities for Pharaoh , Pithom and Rameses .
DARBY	Exodus	1	12	But the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and spread ; and they were distressed because of the children of Israel .
DARBY	Exodus	1	13	And the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with harshness ;
DARBY	Exodus	1	14	and they embittered their life with hard labour in clay and bricks , and in all manner of labour in the field : all their labour with which they made them serve was with harshness .
DARBY	Exodus	1	15	And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives—of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah , and the name of the other was Puah—
DARBY	Exodus	1	16	and he said , When ye help the Hebrew women in bearing , and see [ them ] on the stool , if it be a son , then ye shall kill him , but if a daughter , then she shall live .
DARBY	Exodus	1	17	But the midwives feared God , and did not as the king of Egypt had said to them , but saved the male children alive .
DARBY	Exodus	1	18	And the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them , Why have ye done this , and saved the male children alive ?
DARBY	Exodus	1	19	And the midwives said to Pharaoh , Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian ; for they are strong , and they have borne before the midwife comes to them .
DARBY	Exodus	1	20	And God dealt well with the midwives ; and the people multiplied and became very strong .
DARBY	Exodus	1	21	And it came to pass , because the midwives feared God , that he made them houses .
DARBY	Exodus	1	22	Then Pharaoh charged all his people , saying , Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river , but every daughter ye shall save alive .
DARBY	Exodus	2	2	And the woman conceived , and bore a son . And she saw him that he was fair , and hid him three months .
DARBY	Exodus	2	3	And when she could no longer hide him , she took for him an ark of reeds , and plastered it with resin and with pitch , and put the child in it , and laid [ it ] in the sedge on the bank of the river .
DARBY	Exodus	2	4	And his sister stood afar off to see what would happen to him .
DARBY	Exodus	2	5	And the daughter of Pharaoh went down to bathe in the river ; and her maids went along by the river 's side . And she saw the ark in the midst of the sedge , and sent her handmaid and fetched it .
DARBY	Exodus	2	6	And she opened [ it ] , and saw the child , and behold , the boy wept . And she had compassion on him , and said , This is [ one ] of the Hebrews ' children .
DARBY	Exodus	2	7	And his sister said to Pharaoh 's daughter , Shall I go and call thee a wet-nurse of the Hebrew women , that she may nurse the child for thee ?
DARBY	Exodus	2	8	And Pharaoh 's daughter said to her , Go . And the damsel went and called the child 's mother .
DARBY	Exodus	2	9	And Pharaoh 's daughter said to her , Take this child away and nurse it for me , and I will give [ thee ] thy wages . And the woman took the child and nursed it .
DARBY	Exodus	2	10	And when the child was grown , she brought him to Pharaoh 's daughter , and he became her son . And she called his name Moses , and said , Because I drew him out of the water .
DARBY	Exodus	2	11	And it came to pass in those days , when Moses was grown , that he went out to his brethren and looked on their burdens ; and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew , one of his brethren .
DARBY	Exodus	2	12	And he turned this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no man , he smote the Egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
DARBY	Exodus	2	13	And he went out on the second day , and behold , two Hebrew men were quarrelling ; and he said to him that was in the wrong , Why art thou smiting thy neighbour ?
DARBY	Exodus	2	14	And he said , Who made thee ruler and judge over us ? dost thou intend to kill me , as thou killedst the Egyptian ? Then Moses feared , and said , Surely the matter is known .
DARBY	Exodus	2	15	And Pharaoh heard of this matter , and sought to slay Moses . But Moses fled from before Pharaoh , and dwelt in the land of Midian . And he sat by the well .
DARBY	Exodus	2	16	And the priest of Midian had seven daughters ; and they came and drew [ water ] , and filled the troughs , to water their father 's flock .
DARBY	Exodus	2	17	And the shepherds came and drove them away ; but Moses rose and helped them , and watered their flock .
DARBY	Exodus	2	18	And when they came to Reuel their father , he said , Why are ye come so soon to-day ?
DARBY	Exodus	2	19	And they said , An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds , and also drew [ water ] abundantly for us , and watered the flock .
DARBY	Exodus	2	20	And he said to his daughters , And where is he ? why then have ye left the man behind ? Call him , that he may eat bread .
DARBY	Exodus	2	21	And Moses consented to remain with the man ; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter .
DARBY	Exodus	2	22	And she bore a son , and he called his name Gershom ; for he said , I have been a sojourner in a foreign land .
DARBY	Exodus	2	23	And it came to pass during those many days , that the king of Egypt died . And the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage , and cried ; and their cry came up to God because of the bondage ;
DARBY	Exodus	2	24	and God heard their groaning , and God remembered his covenant with Abraham , with Isaac , and with Jacob ;
DARBY	Exodus	2	25	and God looked upon the children of Israel , and God acknowledged [ them ] .
DARBY	Exodus	3	3	And Moses said , Let me now turn aside and see this great sight , why the thorn-bush is not burnt .
DARBY	Exodus	3	2	And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a thorn-bush : and he looked , and behold , the thorn-bush burned with fire , and the thorn-bush was not being consumed .
DARBY	Exodus	3	4	And Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see , and God called to him out of the midst of the thorn-bush and said , Moses , Moses ! And he said , Here am I .
DARBY	Exodus	3	5	And he said , Draw not nigh hither : loose thy sandals from off thy feet , for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground .
DARBY	Exodus	3	6	And he said , I am the God of thy father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . And Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look at God .
DARBY	Exodus	3	7	And Jehovah said , I have seen assuredly the affliction of my people who are in Egypt , and their cry have I heard on account of their taskmasters ; for I know their sorrows .
DARBY	Exodus	3	8	And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians , and to bring them up out of that land unto a good and spacious land , unto a land flowing with milk and honey , unto the place of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites .
DARBY	Exodus	3	9	And now behold , the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me ; and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them .
DARBY	Exodus	3	10	And now come , and I will send thee unto Pharaoh , that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	3	11	And Moses said to God , Who am I , that I should go unto Pharaoh , and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt ?
DARBY	Exodus	3	12	And he said , For I will be with thee ; and this shall be the sign to thee that I have sent thee : when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt , ye shall serve God upon this mountain .
DARBY	Exodus	3	13	And Moses said to God , Behold , [ when ] I come unto the children of Israel , and shall say unto them , The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you ; and they shall say , What is his name ? what shall I say unto them ?
DARBY	Exodus	3	14	And God said to Moses , I AM THAT I AM . And he said , Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel : I AM hath sent me unto you .
DARBY	Exodus	3	15	And God said moreover to Moses , Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel : Jehovah , the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , hath sent me unto you . This is my name for ever , and this is my memorial unto all generations .
DARBY	Exodus	3	16	Go and gather the elders of Israel together , and say unto them , Jehovah the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , hath appeared to me , saying , I have indeed visited you , and [ seen ] that which is done unto you in Egypt ;
DARBY	Exodus	3	17	and I have said , I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt , unto the land of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , unto a land flowing with milk and honey .
DARBY	Exodus	3	18	And they shall hearken to thy voice . And thou shalt come , thou and the elders of Israel , unto the king of Egypt , and ye shall say unto him , Jehovah , the God of the Hebrews , hath met with us ; and now , let us go , we pray thee , three days ' journey into the wilderness , that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God .
DARBY	Exodus	3	19	But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go , no , not by a powerful hand .
DARBY	Exodus	3	20	And I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof ; and after that he will let you go .
DARBY	Exodus	3	21	And I will give this people favour in the eyes of the Egyptians , and it shall come to pass , when ye go out , that ye shall not go out empty ;
DARBY	Exodus	3	22	but every woman shall ask of her neighbour , and of her that is the inmate of her house , utensils of silver , and utensils of gold , and clothing ; and ye shall put [ them ] on your sons and on your daughters , and shall spoil the Egyptians .
DARBY	Exodus	4	4	And Jehovah said to Moses , Stretch out thy hand and take it by the tail—and he stretched out his hand and caught it , and it became a staff in his hand—
DARBY	Exodus	4	2	And Jehovah said to him , What is that in thy hand ? And he said , A staff .
DARBY	Exodus	4	3	And he said , Cast it on the ground . And he cast it on the ground , and it became a serpent ; and Moses fled from before it .
DARBY	Exodus	4	5	that they may believe that Jehovah , the God of their fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , hath appeared unto thee .
DARBY	Exodus	4	6	And Jehovah said moreover to him , Put now thy hand into thy bosom . And he put his hand into his bosom , and took it out , and behold , his hand was leprous , as snow .
DARBY	Exodus	4	7	And he said , Put thy hand into thy bosom again . And he put his hand into his bosom again , and took it out of his bosom , and behold , it was turned again as his flesh .
DARBY	Exodus	4	8	And it shall come to pass , if they will not believe thee , neither hearken to the voice of the first sign , that they will believe the voice of the other sign .
DARBY	Exodus	4	9	And it shall come to pass , if they will not believe also those two signs , neither hearken unto thy voice , that thou shalt take of the water of the river , and pour [ it ] on the dry [ land ] ; and the water that thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry [ land ] .
DARBY	Exodus	4	10	And Moses said to Jehovah , Ah Lord ! I am not eloquent , neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken to thy servant , for I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue .
DARBY	Exodus	4	11	And Jehovah said to him , Who gave man a mouth ? or who maketh dumb , or deaf , or seeing , or blind ? [ have ] not I , Jehovah ?
DARBY	Exodus	4	12	And now go , and I will be with thy mouth , and will teach thee what thou shalt say .
DARBY	Exodus	4	13	And he said , Ah Lord ! send , I pray thee , by the hand [ of him whom ] thou wilt send .
DARBY	Exodus	4	14	Then the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses , and he said , Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother ? I know that he can speak well . And also behold , he goeth out to meet thee ; and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart .
DARBY	Exodus	4	15	And thou shalt speak unto him , and put the words in his mouth ; and I will be with thy mouth , and with his mouth , and will teach you what ye shall do .
DARBY	Exodus	4	16	And he shall speak for thee unto the people ; and it shall come to pass that he shall be to thee for a mouth , and thou shalt be to him for God .
DARBY	Exodus	4	17	And thou shalt take this staff in thy hand , with which thou shalt do the signs .
DARBY	Exodus	4	18	And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law , and said to him , Let me go , I pray thee , and return to my brethren who are in Egypt , that I may see whether they are yet alive . And Jethro said to Moses , Go in peace .
DARBY	Exodus	4	19	And Jehovah said to Moses in Midian , Go , return to Egypt ; for all the men are dead who sought thy life .
DARBY	Exodus	4	20	And Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them riding upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt . And Moses took the staff of God in his hand .
DARBY	Exodus	4	21	And Jehovah said to Moses , When thou goest to return to Egypt , see that thou do all the wonders before Pharaoh that I have put in thy hand . And I will harden his heart , that he shall not let the people go .
DARBY	Exodus	4	22	And thou shalt say to Pharaoh , Thus saith Jehovah : Israel is my son , my firstborn .
DARBY	Exodus	4	23	And I say to thee , Let my son go , that he may serve me . And if thou refuse to let him go , behold , I will kill thy son , thy firstborn .
DARBY	Exodus	4	24	And it came to pass on the way , in the inn , that Jehovah came upon him , and sought to slay him .
DARBY	Exodus	4	25	Then Zipporah took a stone and cut off the foreskin of her son , and cast it at his feet , and said , A bloody husband indeed art thou to me !
DARBY	Exodus	4	26	And he let him go . Then she said , A bloody husband—because of the circumcision .
DARBY	Exodus	4	27	And Jehovah said to Aaron , Go into the wilderness to meet Moses . And he went , and met him on the mountain of God , and kissed him .
DARBY	Exodus	4	28	And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah who had sent him , and all the signs that he had commanded him .
DARBY	Exodus	4	29	And Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the children of Israel ;
DARBY	Exodus	4	30	and Aaron spoke all the words that Jehovah had spoken to Moses , and did the signs before the eyes of the people .
DARBY	Exodus	4	31	And the people believed . And when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel , and that he had seen their affliction , then they bowed their heads and worshipped .
DARBY	Exodus	5	5	And Pharaoh said , Behold the people of the land are now many , and ye wish to make them rest from their burdens .
DARBY	Exodus	5	2	And Pharaoh said , Who is Jehovah , to whose voice I am to hearken to let Israel go ? I do not know Jehovah , neither will I let Israel go .
DARBY	Exodus	5	3	And they said , The God of the Hebrews has met with us : let us go , we pray thee , three days ' journey into the wilderness , and sacrifice to Jehovah our God ; lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with sword .
DARBY	Exodus	5	4	And the king of Egypt said to them , Why do ye , Moses and Aaron , wish to have the people go off from their works ? Away , to your burdens !
DARBY	Exodus	5	6	And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people , and their officers , saying ,
DARBY	Exodus	5	7	Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick , as heretofore : let them go and gather straw for themselves .
DARBY	Exodus	5	8	And the number of the bricks they have made heretofore shall ye lay upon them : ye shall not diminish any of it , for they are idle ; therefore they cry , saying , Let us go [ and ] sacrifice to our God .
DARBY	Exodus	5	9	Let them put heavier labour on the men , that they may be taken up with it , and not regard vain words .
DARBY	Exodus	5	10	And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out and spoke to the people , saying , Thus says Pharaoh : I will not give you straw :
DARBY	Exodus	5	11	go ye , get yourselves straw where ye may find it ; but none of your work shall be diminished .
DARBY	Exodus	5	12	And the people were scattered abroad throughout the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw .
DARBY	Exodus	5	13	And the taskmasters urged [ them ] , saying , Fulfil your labours , the daily work , as when there was straw .
DARBY	Exodus	5	14	And the officers of the children of Israel , whom Pharaoh 's taskmasters had set over them , were beaten , [ and ] it was said , Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick , both yesterday and to-day , as heretofore ?
DARBY	Exodus	5	15	Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh , saying , Why dost thou deal thus with thy bondmen ?
DARBY	Exodus	5	16	There is no straw given to thy bondmen , and they say to us , Make brick ; and behold , thy bondmen are beaten , but it is the fault of thy people .
DARBY	Exodus	5	17	And he said , Ye are idle , idle ! therefore ye say , Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	5	18	And now go—work ! and straw shall not be given you , and ye shall deliver the measure of bricks .
DARBY	Exodus	5	19	And the officers of the children of Israel saw [ that ] it stood ill with them , because it was said , Ye shall not diminish anything from your bricks , the daily work .
DARBY	Exodus	5	20	And they met Moses and Aaron , who stood there to meet them , as they came out from Pharaoh .
DARBY	Exodus	5	21	And they said to them , Jehovah look upon you and judge , that ye have made our odour to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of his bondmen , putting a sword into their hand to kill us !
DARBY	Exodus	5	22	And Moses returned to Jehovah , and said , Lord , why hast thou done evil to this people ? why now hast thou sent me ?
DARBY	Exodus	5	23	For ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name , he hath done evil to this people ; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all !
DARBY	Exodus	6	6	Therefore say unto the children of Israel , I am Jehovah , and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians , and I will deliver you from their service , and I will redeem you with a stretched-out arm , and with great judgments .
DARBY	Exodus	6	2	And God spoke to Moses , and said to him , I am Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	6	3	And I appeared unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , as the Almighty God ; but by my name Jehovah I was not made known to them .
DARBY	Exodus	6	4	And I established also my covenant with them , to give them the land of Canaan , the land of their pilgrimage , in which they were sojourners .
DARBY	Exodus	6	5	And I have heard also the groaning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians have forced to serve , and I have remembered my covenant .
DARBY	Exodus	6	7	And I will take you to me for a people , and will be your God ; and ye shall know that I , Jehovah your God , am he who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
DARBY	Exodus	6	8	And I will bring you into the land concerning which I swore to give it unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob ; and I will give it you for a possession : I am Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	6	9	And Moses spoke thus to the children of Israel ; but they did not listen to Moses from anguish of spirit , and from hard service .
DARBY	Exodus	6	10	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Exodus	6	11	Go in , speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
DARBY	Exodus	6	12	And Moses spoke before Jehovah , saying , Lo , the children of Israel do not hearken to me : how then should Pharaoh hearken to me , to me of uncircumcised lips ?
DARBY	Exodus	6	13	And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron , and gave them a commandment to the children of Israel , and to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	6	14	These are the heads of their fathers ' houses : the sons of Reuben , the firstborn of Israel : Enoch and Phallu , Hezron and Carmi : these are the families of Reuben .
DARBY	Exodus	6	15	—And the sons of Simeon : Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Saul the son of a Canaanitish woman : these are the families of Simeon .
DARBY	Exodus	6	16	And these are the names of the sons of Levi , according to their generations : Gershon , and Kohath , and Merari . And the years of the life of Levi were a hundred and thirty-seven years .
DARBY	Exodus	6	17	The sons of Gershon : Libni and Shimei , according to their families .
DARBY	Exodus	6	18	And the sons of Kohath : Amram , and Jizhar , and Hebron , and Uzziel . And the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred and thirty-three years .
DARBY	Exodus	6	19	And the sons of Merari : Mahli and Mushi : these are the families of Levi according to their generations .
DARBY	Exodus	6	20	And Amram took Jochebed his aunt as wife ; and she bore him Aaron and Moses . And the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty-seven years .
DARBY	Exodus	6	21	And the sons of Jizhar : Korah , and Nepheg , and Zicri .
DARBY	Exodus	6	22	And the sons of Uzziel : Mishael , and Elzaphan , and Sithri .
DARBY	Exodus	6	23	And Aaron took Elisheba , daughter of Amminadab , sister of Nahshon , as wife ; and she bore him Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar .
DARBY	Exodus	6	24	And the sons of Korah : Assir , and Elkanah , and Abiasaph : these are the families of the Korahites .
DARBY	Exodus	6	25	And Eleazar Aaron 's son took [ one ] of the daughters of Putiel as wife ; and she bore him Phinehas : these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families .
DARBY	Exodus	6	26	This is that Aaron and Moses , to whom Jehovah said , Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts .
DARBY	Exodus	6	27	These are they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt : this is that Moses and Aaron .
DARBY	Exodus	6	28	And it came to pass on the day when Jehovah spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt ,
DARBY	Exodus	6	29	that Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying , I am Jehovah : speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee .
DARBY	Exodus	6	30	And Moses said before Jehovah , Behold , I am of uncircumcised lips , and how will Pharaoh hearken unto me ?
DARBY	Exodus	7	7	And Moses was eighty years old , and Aaron was eighty-three years old , when they spoke to Pharaoh .
DARBY	Exodus	7	2	Thou shalt speak all that I command thee ; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
DARBY	Exodus	7	3	And I will render Pharaoh 's heart obdurate , and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	7	4	And Pharaoh will not hearken unto you ; and I will lay my hand upon Egypt , and bring forth my hosts , my people , the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
DARBY	Exodus	7	5	And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah , when I stretch forth my hand on Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them .
DARBY	Exodus	7	6	And Moses and Aaron did as Jehovah had commanded them : so did they .
DARBY	Exodus	7	8	And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
DARBY	Exodus	7	9	When Pharaoh shall speak to you , saying , Do a miracle for yourselves , —then thou shalt say unto Aaron , Take thy staff and cast [ it ] before Pharaoh—it will become a serpent .
DARBY	Exodus	7	10	And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh , and did so , as Jehovah had commanded ; and Aaron cast down his staff before Pharaoh , and before his bondmen , and it became a serpent .
DARBY	Exodus	7	11	And Pharaoh also called the sages and the sorcerers ; and they too , the scribes of Egypt , did so with their enchantments :
DARBY	Exodus	7	12	they cast down every man his staff , and they became serpents ; but Aaron 's staff swallowed up their staves .
DARBY	Exodus	7	13	And Pharaoh 's heart was stubborn , and he hearkened not to them , as Jehovah had said .
DARBY	Exodus	7	14	And Jehovah said to Moses , Pharaoh 's heart is hardened : he refuseth to let the people go .
DARBY	Exodus	7	15	Go unto Pharaoh in the morning—behold , he will go out unto the water—and take thy stand by the bank of the river in front of him ; and take in thy hand the staff that was turned into a serpent .
DARBY	Exodus	7	16	And say unto him , Jehovah the God of the Hebrews has sent me to thee , saying , Let my people go , that they may serve me in the wilderness ; but behold , hitherto thou hast not hearkened .
DARBY	Exodus	7	17	Thus saith Jehovah : In this shalt thou know that I am Jehovah—behold , I will smite with the staff that is in my hand upon the water which is in the river , and it shall be turned into blood .
DARBY	Exodus	7	18	And the fish that is in the river shall die ; and the river shall stink ; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink the water out of the river .
DARBY	Exodus	7	19	And Jehovah said to Moses , Say unto Aaron , Take thy staff , and stretch out thy hand upon the waters of the Egyptians—upon their streams , upon their rivers , and upon their ponds , and upon all their reservoirs of water , that they may become blood ; and there shall be blood throughout the land of Egypt , both in [ vessels of ] wood and in [ vessels of ] stone .
DARBY	Exodus	7	20	And Moses and Aaron did so , as Jehovah had commanded ; and he lifted up the staff , and smote the waters that were in the river before the eyes of Pharaoh , and before the eyes of his bondmen ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned into blood .
DARBY	Exodus	7	21	And the fish that was in the river died ; and the river stank , and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river ; and the blood was throughout the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	7	22	And the scribes of Egypt did so with their sorceries ; and Pharaoh 's heart was stubborn , neither did he hearken to them , as Jehovah had said .
DARBY	Exodus	7	23	And Pharaoh turned and went into his house , and took not this to heart either .
DARBY	Exodus	7	24	And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink ; for they could not drink of the water of the river .
DARBY	Exodus	7	25	And seven days were fulfilled , after Jehovah had smitten the river .
DARBY	Exodus	8	8	And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron , and said , Intreat Jehovah , that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people ; and I will let the people go , that they may sacrifice to Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	8	2	And if thou refuse to let [ them ] go , behold , I will smite all thy borders with frogs .
DARBY	Exodus	8	3	And the river shall swarm with frogs , and they shall go up and come into thy house , and into thy bedroom , and upon thy bed , and into the house of thy bondmen , and upon thy people , and into thine ovens , and into thy kneading-troughs .
DARBY	Exodus	8	4	And the frogs shall come up both upon thee and upon thy people , and upon all thy bondmen .
DARBY	Exodus	8	5	And Jehovah said to Moses , Say unto Aaron , Stretch out thy hand with thy staff over the streams , over the rivers , and over the ponds , and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	8	6	And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt ; and the frogs came up , and covered the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	8	7	And the scribes did so with their sorceries , and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	8	9	And Moses said to Pharaoh , Glory over me , for what time shall I intreat for thee , and for thy bondmen , and for thy people , to cut off the frogs from thee and from thy houses ; [ so that ] they shall remain in the river only ?
DARBY	Exodus	8	10	And he said , For to-morrow . And he said , Be it according to thy word ; that thou mayest know that there is none like Jehovah our God .
DARBY	Exodus	8	11	And the frogs shall depart from thee , and from thy houses , and from thy bondmen , and from thy people : they shall remain in the river only .
DARBY	Exodus	8	12	And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh ; and Moses cried to Jehovah because of the frogs that he had brought against Pharaoh .
DARBY	Exodus	8	13	And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses ; and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the courts , and out of the fields .
DARBY	Exodus	8	14	And they gathered them in heaps ; and the land stank .
DARBY	Exodus	8	15	And Pharaoh saw that there was respite ; and he hardened his heart , and hearkened not to them , as Jehovah had said .
DARBY	Exodus	8	16	And Jehovah said to Moses , Say unto Aaron , Stretch out thy staff , and smite the dust of the earth , and it shall become gnats throughout the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	8	17	And they did so ; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff , and smote the dust of the earth , and there arose gnats on man and on beast : all the dust of the land became gnats throughout the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	8	18	And the scribes did so with their sorceries , to bring forth gnats ; but they could not . And the gnats were on man and on beast .
DARBY	Exodus	8	19	Then the scribes said to Pharaoh , This is the finger of God ! But Pharaoh 's heart was stubborn , and he hearkened not to them , as Jehovah had said .
DARBY	Exodus	8	20	And Jehovah said to Moses , Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh—behold , he will go out to the water—and say to him , Thus saith Jehovah , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
DARBY	Exodus	8	21	For , if thou do not let my people go , behold , I will send dog-flies upon thee , and upon thy bondmen , and upon thy people , and into thy houses ; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of dog-flies , and also the ground on which they are .
DARBY	Exodus	8	22	And I will distinguish in that day the land of Goshen , in which my people dwell , that no dog-flies shall be there ; that thou mayest know that I Jehovah am in the midst of the land .
DARBY	Exodus	8	23	And I will put a separation between my people and thy people ; to-morrow shall this sign be .
DARBY	Exodus	8	24	And Jehovah did so ; and there came dog-flies in a multitude into the house of Pharaoh , and [ into ] the houses of his bondmen ; and throughout the land of Egypt , the land was corrupted by the dog-flies .
DARBY	Exodus	8	25	And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron , and said , Go , sacrifice to your God in the land .
DARBY	Exodus	8	26	And Moses said , It is not proper to do so ; for we should sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God : lo , if we sacrificed the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes , would they not stone us ?
DARBY	Exodus	8	27	We will go three days ' journey into the wilderness , and sacrifice to Jehovah our God , as he shall command us .
DARBY	Exodus	8	28	And Pharaoh said , I will let you go , that you may sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness ; only , go not very far away : intreat for me !
DARBY	Exodus	8	29	And Moses said , Behold , I go out from thee , and will intreat Jehovah ; and the dog-flies will depart from Pharaoh , from his bondmen , and from his people , to-morrow ; only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	8	30	And Moses went out from Pharaoh , and intreated Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	8	31	And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses ; and he removed the dog-flies from Pharaoh , from his bondmen , and from his people ; there remained not one .
DARBY	Exodus	8	32	And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also , and would not let the people go .
DARBY	Exodus	9	9	And it shall become fine dust over all the land of Egypt , and shall become boils on man and on cattle , breaking out [ with ] blisters , throughout the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	9	2	For if thou refuse to let them go , and shalt retain them still ,
DARBY	Exodus	9	3	behold , the hand of Jehovah shall be on thy cattle which is in the field , on the horses , on the asses , on the camels , on the oxen and on the sheep , with a very grievous plague .
DARBY	Exodus	9	4	And Jehovah will distinguish between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt ; and there shall nothing die of all that the children of Israel have .
DARBY	Exodus	9	5	And Jehovah appointed a set time , saying , To-morrow will Jehovah do this thing in the land .
DARBY	Exodus	9	6	And Jehovah did this thing on the following day , and all the cattle of Egypt died ; but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one .
DARBY	Exodus	9	7	And Pharaoh sent , and behold , there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead . But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened , and he did not let the people go .
DARBY	Exodus	9	8	And Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron , Take to yourselves handfuls of ashes of the furnace , and let Moses scatter it toward the heavens before the eyes of Pharaoh .
DARBY	Exodus	9	10	And they took ashes of the furnace , and stood before Pharaoh ; and Moses sprinkled it toward the heavens ; and it became boils [ with ] blisters breaking out on man and on cattle .
DARBY	Exodus	9	11	And the scribes could not stand before Moses because of the boils ; for the boils were on the scribes , and on all the Egyptians .
DARBY	Exodus	9	12	And Jehovah made Pharaoh 's heart stubborn , and he did not hearken to them , as Jehovah had told Moses .
DARBY	Exodus	9	13	And Jehovah said to Moses , Rise up early in the morning , and set thyself before Pharaoh , and say to him , Thus saith Jehovah , the God of the Hebrews : Let my people go , that they may serve me .
DARBY	Exodus	9	14	For I will at this time send all my plagues to thy heart , and on thy bondmen , and on thy people ; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth .
DARBY	Exodus	9	15	For now shall I put forth my hand , and I will smite thee and thy people with pestilence ; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth .
DARBY	Exodus	9	16	And for this very cause have I raised thee up , to shew thee my power ; and that my name may be declared in all the earth .
DARBY	Exodus	9	17	Dost thou still exalt thyself against my people , that thou wilt not let them go ?
DARBY	Exodus	9	18	Behold , to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail , such as hath not been in Egypt since its foundation until now .
DARBY	Exodus	9	19	And now send , [ and ] secure thy cattle , and all that thou hast in the field : all the men and the cattle that are found in the field , and are not brought home—on them the hail shall come down , and they shall die .
DARBY	Exodus	9	20	He that feared the word of Jehovah among the bondmen of Pharaoh made his bondmen and his cattle flee into the houses .
DARBY	Exodus	9	21	But he that did not regard the word of Jehovah left his bondmen and his cattle in the field .
DARBY	Exodus	9	22	And Jehovah said to Moses , Stretch out thy hand toward the heavens , that there may be hail throughout the land of Egypt , upon men , and upon cattle , and upon every herb of the field in the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	9	23	And Moses stretched out his staff toward the heavens , and Jehovah gave thunder and hail ; and the fire ran along the ground ; and Jehovah rained hail on the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	9	24	And there was hail , and fire mingled with the hail , very grievous , such as there had been none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
DARBY	Exodus	9	25	And the hail smote throughout the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both men and cattle ; and the hail smote every herb of the field , and broke every tree of the field .
DARBY	Exodus	9	26	Only in the land of Goshen , where the children of Israel were , was there no hail .
DARBY	Exodus	9	27	And Pharaoh sent , and called Moses and Aaron , and said to them , I have sinned this time : Jehovah is the righteous [ one ] , but I and my people are the wicked [ ones ] .
DARBY	Exodus	9	28	Intreat Jehovah that it may be enough , that there be no more thunder of God and hail ; and I will let you go , and ye shall stay no longer !
DARBY	Exodus	9	29	And Moses said to him , When I go out of the city , I will spread out my hands to Jehovah : the thunder will cease , and there will be no more hail ; that thou mayest know that the earth is Jehovah 's .
DARBY	Exodus	9	30	But as to thee and thy bondmen , I know that ye do not yet fear Jehovah Elohim .
DARBY	Exodus	9	31	And the flax and the barley were smitten ; for the barley was in the ear , and the flax was bolled .
DARBY	Exodus	9	32	But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten ; for they were not come out into ear .
DARBY	Exodus	9	33	And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread out his hands to Jehovah ; and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not [ any more ] poured on the earth .
DARBY	Exodus	9	34	And Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased , and he sinned yet more , and hardened his heart , he , and his bondmen .
DARBY	Exodus	9	35	And the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn , neither would he let the children of Israel go , as Jehovah had spoken by Moses .
DARBY	Exodus	10	10	And he said to them , Let Jehovah be so with you , as I let you go , and your little ones : see that evil is before you !
DARBY	Exodus	10	2	and that thou mightest tell in the ears of thy son and thy son 's son what I have wrought in Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	10	3	And Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh , and said to him , Thus saith Jehovah the God of the Hebrews : How long dost thou refuse to humble thyself before me ? let my people go , that they may serve me .
DARBY	Exodus	10	4	For , if thou refuse to let my people go , behold , I will to-morrow bring locusts into thy borders ;
DARBY	Exodus	10	5	and they shall cover the face of the land , so that ye will not be able to see the land ; and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped , which ye have remaining from the hail , and shall eat every tree which ye have growing in the field ;
DARBY	Exodus	10	6	and they shall fill thy houses , and the houses of all thy bondmen , and the houses of all the Egyptians ; which neither thy fathers nor thy fathers ' fathers have seen , since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day . And he turned and went out from Pharaoh .
DARBY	Exodus	10	7	And Pharaoh 's bondmen said to him , How long shall this man be a snare to us ? let the men go , that they may serve Jehovah their God : dost thou not yet know that Egypt is ruined ?
DARBY	Exodus	10	8	And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh . And he said to them , Go , serve Jehovah your God . Who are they that shall go ?
DARBY	Exodus	10	9	And Moses said , We will go with our young and with our old , with our sons and with our daughters ; with our flocks and with our herds will we go ; for we have a feast of Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	10	11	Not so : go now , ye [ that are ] men , and serve Jehovah ! for it is that ye have desired . And they were driven out from Pharaoh 's presence .
DARBY	Exodus	10	12	And Jehovah said to Moses , Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts , that they may come up over the land of Egypt , and eat every herb of the land—all that the hail hath left .
DARBY	Exodus	10	13	And Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt , and Jehovah brought an east wind on the land all that day and all that night . When it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
DARBY	Exodus	10	14	And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the borders of Egypt , very grievous ; before them there were no such locusts as they , neither after them will be such .
DARBY	Exodus	10	15	And they covered the face of the whole land , so that the land was darkened ; and they ate every herb of the land , and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left ; and there remained not any green thing on the trees , and in the herbs of the field , throughout the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	10	16	And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron in haste ; and he said , I have sinned against Jehovah your God , and against you .
DARBY	Exodus	10	17	And now , forgive , I pray you , my sin only this time , and intreat Jehovah your God that he may take away from me this death only !
DARBY	Exodus	10	18	And he went out from Pharaoh , and intreated Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	10	19	And Jehovah turned a very powerful west wind , which took away the locusts , and drove them into the Red Sea : there remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	10	20	And Jehovah made Pharaoh 's heart stubborn , and he did not let the children of Israel go .
DARBY	Exodus	10	21	And Jehovah said to Moses , Stretch out thy hand toward the heavens , that there may be darkness in the land of Egypt—so that one may feel darkness .
DARBY	Exodus	10	22	And Moses stretched out his hand toward the heavens ; and there was a thick darkness throughout the land of Egypt three days :
DARBY	Exodus	10	23	they saw not one another , neither rose any from his place , for three days . But all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings .
DARBY	Exodus	10	24	And Pharaoh called Moses and said , Go , serve Jehovah ; only , let your flocks and your herds remain ; let your little ones also go with you .
DARBY	Exodus	10	25	And Moses said , Thou must give also sacrifices and burnt-offerings into our hands , that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God .
DARBY	Exodus	10	26	Our cattle also must go with us : there shall not a hoof be left behind ; for we must take thereof to serve Jehovah our God ; and we do not know with what we must serve Jehovah , until we come there .
DARBY	Exodus	10	27	But Jehovah made Pharaoh 's heart stubborn , and he would not let them go .
DARBY	Exodus	10	28	And Pharaoh said to him , Get thee from me , take heed to thyself , see my face no more ; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die .
DARBY	Exodus	10	29	And Moses said , Thou hast spoken rightly : I will see thy face again no more !
DARBY	Exodus	11	11	And Jehovah said to Moses , Yet one plague will I bring upon Pharaoh , and upon Egypt ; afterwards he will let you go hence : when he shall let [ you ] go altogether , he shall utterly drive you out hence .
DARBY	Exodus	11	2	Speak now in the ears of the people , that they ask every man of his neighbour , and every woman of her neighbour , utensils of silver and utensils of gold .
DARBY	Exodus	11	3	And Jehovah gave the people favour in the eyes of the Egyptians . Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt—in the eyes of Pharaoh 's bondmen , and in the eyes of the people .
DARBY	Exodus	11	4	And Moses said , Thus saith Jehovah : About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	11	5	And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sitteth on his throne , even unto the firstborn of the bondwoman that is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of cattle .
DARBY	Exodus	11	6	And there shall be a great cry throughout the land of Egypt , such as there hath been none like it , nor shall be like it any more .
DARBY	Exodus	11	7	But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue , against man or beast ; that ye may know that Jehovah distinguisheth between the Egyptians and Israel .
DARBY	Exodus	11	8	And all these thy bondmen shall come down unto me , and bow down to me , saying , Go out , thou , and all the people that follow thee ; and after that I will go out . And he went out from Pharaoh in a glowing anger .
DARBY	Exodus	11	9	And Jehovah had said to Moses , Pharaoh shall not hearken to you ; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	11	10	And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh ; but Jehovah made Pharaoh 's heart stubborn , and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land .
DARBY	Exodus	12	12	And I will go through the land of Egypt in that night , and smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both man and beast ; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment : I am Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	12	2	This month shall be unto you the beginning of months : it shall be the first month of the year to you .
DARBY	Exodus	12	3	Speak unto all the assembly of Israel , saying , On the tenth of this month let them take themselves each a lamb , for a father 's house , a lamb for a house .
DARBY	Exodus	12	4	And if the household be too small for a lamb , let him and his neighbour next unto his house take [ it ] according to the number of the souls ; each according to [ the measure ] of his eating shall ye count for the lamb .
DARBY	Exodus	12	5	Your lamb shall be without blemish , a yearling male ; ye shall take [ it ] from the sheep , or from the goats .
DARBY	Exodus	12	6	And ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month ; and the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel shall kill it between the two evenings .
DARBY	Exodus	12	7	And they shall take of the blood , and put [ it ] on the two door-posts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it .
DARBY	Exodus	12	8	And they shall eat the flesh in that night , roast with fire , and unleavened bread ; with bitter [ herbs ] shall they eat it .
DARBY	Exodus	12	9	Ye shall eat none of it raw , nor boiled at all with water , but roast with fire ; its head with its legs and with its in-wards .
DARBY	Exodus	12	10	And ye shall let none of it remain until the morning ; and what remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire .
DARBY	Exodus	12	11	And thus shall ye eat it : your loins shall be girded , your sandals on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and ye shall eat it in haste ; it is Jehovah 's passover .
DARBY	Exodus	12	13	And the blood shall be for you as a sign on the houses in which ye are ; and when I see the blood , I will pass over you ; and the plague shall not be among you for destruction , when I smite the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	12	14	And this day shall be unto you for a memorial ; and ye shall celebrate it [ as ] a feast to Jehovah ; throughout your generations [ as ] an ordinance for ever shall ye celebrate it .
DARBY	Exodus	12	15	Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread : on the very first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses ; for whoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day—that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
DARBY	Exodus	12	16	And on the first day ye shall have a holy convocation , and on the seventh day a holy convocation : no manner of work shall be done on them , save what is eaten by every person—that only shall be done by you .
DARBY	Exodus	12	17	And ye shall keep the [ feast of ] unleavened [ bread ] ; for in this same day have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt ; and ye shall keep this day in your generations [ as ] an ordinance for ever .
DARBY	Exodus	12	18	In the first [ month ] , on the fourteenth day of the month , in the evening , ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month in the evening .
DARBY	Exodus	12	19	Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses ; for whoever eateth what is leavened—that soul shall be cut off from the assembly of Israel , whether he be a sojourner , or born in the land .
DARBY	Exodus	12	20	Ye shall eat nothing leavened : in all your dwellings shall ye eat unleavened bread .
DARBY	Exodus	12	21	And Moses called all the elders of Israel , and said to them , Seize and take yourselves lambs for your families , and kill the passover .
DARBY	Exodus	12	22	And take a bunch of hyssop , and dip [ it ] in the blood that is in the bason , and smear the lintel and the two door-posts with the blood that is in the bason ; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning .
DARBY	Exodus	12	23	And Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians ; and when he sees the blood on the lintel , and on the two door-posts , Jehovah will pass over the door , and will not suffer the destroyer to come into your houses to smite [ you ] .
DARBY	Exodus	12	24	And ye shall observe this as an ordinance for thee and for thy sons for ever .
DARBY	Exodus	12	25	And it shall come to pass , when ye are come into the land that Jehovah will give you , as he has promised , that ye shall keep this service .
DARBY	Exodus	12	26	And it shall come to pass , when your children shall say to you , What mean ye by this service ?
DARBY	Exodus	12	27	that ye shall say , It is a sacrifice of passover to Jehovah , who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when he smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses . And the people bowed their heads and worshipped .
DARBY	Exodus	12	28	And the children of Israel went away , and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron ; so did they .
DARBY	Exodus	12	29	And it came to pass that at midnight Jehovah smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon , and all the firstborn of cattle .
DARBY	Exodus	12	30	And Pharaoh rose up in the night , he , and all his bondmen , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house in which there was not one dead .
DARBY	Exodus	12	31	And he called Moses and Aaron in the night , and said , Rise up , go away from among my people , both ye and the children of Israel ; and go , serve Jehovah , as ye have said .
DARBY	Exodus	12	32	Also take your flocks and your herds , as ye have said , and go ; and bless me also .
DARBY	Exodus	12	33	And the Egyptians urged the people , to send them out of the land in haste ; for they said , We are all dead [ men ] !
DARBY	Exodus	12	34	And the people took their dough before it was leavened ; their kneading-troughs bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders .
DARBY	Exodus	12	35	And the children of Israel had done according to the word of Moses , and they had asked of the Egyptians utensils of silver , and utensils of gold , and clothing .
DARBY	Exodus	12	36	And Jehovah had given the people favour in the eyes of the Egyptians , and they gave to them ; and they spoiled the Egyptians .
DARBY	Exodus	12	37	And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot [ that were ] men , besides children .
DARBY	Exodus	12	38	And a mixed multitude went up also with them ; and flocks and herds—very much cattle .
DARBY	Exodus	12	39	And they baked the dough that they brought forth out of Egypt into unleavened cakes , for it was not leavened ; for they were driven out of Egypt , and could not wait ; neither had they prepared for themselves any food .
DARBY	Exodus	12	40	And the residence of the children of Israel that they resided in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years .
DARBY	Exodus	12	41	And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years , on that same day it came to pass that all the hosts of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	12	42	It is a night of observance to Jehovah , because of their being brought out from the land of Egypt : that same night is an observance to Jehovah for all the children of Israel in their generations .
DARBY	Exodus	12	43	And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron , This is the ordinance of the passover : No stranger shall eat of it ;
DARBY	Exodus	12	44	but every man 's bondman that is bought for money—let him be circumcised : then shall he eat it .
DARBY	Exodus	12	45	A settler and a hired servant shall not eat it .
DARBY	Exodus	12	46	In one house shall it be eaten ; thou shalt not carry forth any of the flesh abroad out of the house ; neither shall ye break a bone thereof .
DARBY	Exodus	12	47	All the assembly of Israel shall hold it .
DARBY	Exodus	12	48	And when a sojourner sojourneth with thee , and would hold the passover to Jehovah , let all his males be circumcised , and then let him come near and hold it ; and he shall be as one that is born in the land ; but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof .
DARBY	Exodus	12	49	One law shall be for him that is home-born and for the sojourner that sojourneth among you .
DARBY	Exodus	12	50	And all the children of Israel did as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron ; so did they .
DARBY	Exodus	12	51	And it came to pass on that same day , [ that ] Jehovah brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt according to their hosts .
DARBY	Exodus	13	13	And every firstling of an ass shalt thou ransom with a lamb ; and if thou do not ransom it , thou shalt break its neck ; and every firstborn of a man among thy sons shalt thou ransom .
DARBY	Exodus	13	2	Hallow unto me every firstborn , whatever breaketh open the womb among the children of Israel , of man and of cattle : it is mine .
DARBY	Exodus	13	3	And Moses said to the people , Remember this day , in which ye came out from Egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for with a powerful hand hath Jehovah brought you out from this ; and nothing leavened shall be eaten .
DARBY	Exodus	13	4	Ye come out to-day , in the month Abib .
DARBY	Exodus	13	5	And it shall be when Jehovah hath brought thee into the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Hivite and the Jebusite , which he swore to thy fathers to give thee , a land flowing with milk and honey , that thou shalt keep this service in this month .
DARBY	Exodus	13	6	Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread ; and in the seventh day is a feast to Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	13	7	Unleavened bread shall be eaten the seven days ; and leavened bread shall not be seen with thee , neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy borders .
DARBY	Exodus	13	8	And thou shalt inform thy son in that day , saying , It is because of what Jehovah did to me when I came out of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	13	9	And it shall be for a sign to thee on thy hand , and for a memorial between thine eyes , that the law of Jehovah may be in thy mouth ; for with a powerful hand hath Jehovah brought thee out of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	13	10	And thou shalt keep this ordinance at its set time from year to year .
DARBY	Exodus	13	11	And it shall be when Jehovah hath brought thee into the land of the Canaanites , as he hath sworn to thee and to thy fathers , and hath given it thee ,
DARBY	Exodus	13	12	that thou shalt offer unto Jehovah all that breaketh open the womb , and every firstling that cometh of cattle which is thine : the males [ shall be ] Jehovah 's .
DARBY	Exodus	13	14	And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come , saying , What is this ? that thou shalt say to him , With a powerful hand Jehovah brought us out from Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
DARBY	Exodus	13	15	And it came to pass , when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go , that Jehovah slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , both the firstborn of men and the firstborn of cattle : therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that breaketh open the womb—being males ; and every firstborn of my children I ransom .
DARBY	Exodus	13	16	And it shall be for a sign on thy hand , and for frontlets between thine eyes , for with a powerful hand Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	13	17	And it came to pass , when Pharaoh let the people go , that God did not lead them the way of the land of the Philistines , although that was near ; for God said , That the people may not repent when they see conflict , and return to Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	13	18	And God led the people about , the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea ; and the children of Israel went arrayed out of the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	13	19	And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him ; for he had made the children of Israel swear an oath , saying , God will be sure to visit you ; then ye shall carry my bones with you hence .
DARBY	Exodus	13	20	And they took their journey from Succoth , and encamped in Etham , at the end of the wilderness .
DARBY	Exodus	13	21	And Jehovah went before their face by day in a pillar of a cloud , to lead them [ in ] the way ; and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light ; so that they could go day and night .
DARBY	Exodus	13	22	The pillar of the cloud did not remove [ from ] before the people by day , nor the pillar of fire by night .
DARBY	Exodus	14	14	Jehovah will fight for you , and ye shall be still .
DARBY	Exodus	14	2	Speak unto the children of Israel , that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth , between Migdol and the sea : before Baal-Zephon , opposite to it , shall ye encamp by the sea .
DARBY	Exodus	14	3	And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel , They are entangled in the land , the wilderness has hemmed them in .
DARBY	Exodus	14	4	And I will harden Pharaoh 's heart , that he may pursue after them ; and I will glorify myself in Pharaoh , and in all his host ; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah . And they did so .
DARBY	Exodus	14	5	And it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled ; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his bondmen was turned against the people , and they said , Why have we done this , that we have let Israel go from our service ?
DARBY	Exodus	14	6	And he yoked his chariot , and took his people with him .
DARBY	Exodus	14	7	And he took six hundred chosen chariots , and all the chariots of Egypt , and captains over every one of them .
DARBY	Exodus	14	8	And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel ; and the children of Israel had gone out with a high hand .
DARBY	Exodus	14	9	And the Egyptians pursued after them , —all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh , and his horsemen , and his army , and overtook them where they had encamped by the sea , beside Pi-hahiroth , opposite to Baal-Zephon .
DARBY	Exodus	14	10	And Pharaoh approached ; and the children of Israel lifted up their eyes , and behold , the Egyptians marched after them ; and the children of Israel were much afraid , and cried out to Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	14	11	And they said to Moses , Is it because there were no graves in Egypt , thou hast taken us away to die in the wilderness ? why hast thou done this to us , that thou hast led us out of Egypt ?
DARBY	Exodus	14	12	Is not this what we told thee in Egypt , when we said , Let us alone , and we will serve the Egyptians ? For [ it had been ] better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness .
DARBY	Exodus	14	13	And Moses said to the people , Fear not : stand still , and see the salvation of Jehovah , which he will work for you to-day ; for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day , ye shall see them again no more for ever .
DARBY	Exodus	14	15	And Jehovah said to Moses , Why dost thou cry unto me ? Speak unto the children of Israel , that they go forward .
DARBY	Exodus	14	16	And thou , lift thy staff , and stretch out thy hand over the sea , and divide it ; and the children of Israel shall go on dry [ ground ] through the midst of the sea .
DARBY	Exodus	14	17	And I , behold , I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall pursue after them ; and I will glorify myself in Pharaoh and in all his host , in his chariots and in his horsemen .
DARBY	Exodus	14	18	And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah , when I have glorified myself in Pharaoh , in his chariots and in his horsemen .
DARBY	Exodus	14	19	And the Angel of God , who went before the camp of Israel , removed and went behind them ; and the pillar of the cloud went from before them , and stood behind them .
DARBY	Exodus	14	20	And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel ; and was a cloud and darkness , and lit up the night ; and the one did not come near the other all the night .
DARBY	Exodus	14	21	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea ; and Jehovah made the sea go [ back ] by a strong east wind all the night , and made the sea dry [ land ] , and the waters were divided .
DARBY	Exodus	14	22	And the children of Israel went through the midst of the sea on the dry [ ground ] ; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left .
DARBY	Exodus	14	23	And the Egyptians pursued and came after them—all Pharaoh 's horses , his chariots and his horsemen , into the midst of the sea .
DARBY	Exodus	14	24	And it came to pass in the morning watch , that Jehovah looked upon the camp of the Egyptians , in the pillar of fire and of the cloud , and embarrassed the camp of the Egyptians .
DARBY	Exodus	14	25	And he took off their chariot wheels , and caused them to drive with difficulty ; and the Egyptians said , Let us flee before Israel , for Jehovah is fighting for them against the Egyptians !
DARBY	Exodus	14	26	And Jehovah said to Moses , Stretch out thy hand over the sea , that the waters may return upon the Egyptians , upon their chariots and upon their horsemen .
DARBY	Exodus	14	27	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to its strength toward the morning ; and the Egyptians fled against it ; and Jehovah overturned the Egyptians into the midst of the sea .
DARBY	Exodus	14	28	And the waters returned , and covered the chariots and the horsemen of all the host of Pharaoh that had come into the sea after them ; there remained not even one of them .
DARBY	Exodus	14	29	And the children of Israel walked on dry [ ground ] through the midst of the sea ; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left .
DARBY	Exodus	14	30	Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians ; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the sea-shore .
DARBY	Exodus	14	31	And Israel saw the great power [ with ] which Jehovah had wrought against the Egyptians ; and the people feared Jehovah , and believed in Jehovah , and in Moses his bondman .
DARBY	Exodus	15	15	Then the princes of Edom were amazed ; The mighty men of Moab , trembling hath seized them ; All the inhabitants of Canaan melted away .
DARBY	Exodus	15	2	My strength and song is Jah , and he is become my salvation : This is my God , and I will glorify him ; My father 's God , and I will extol him .
DARBY	Exodus	15	3	Jehovah is a man of war ; Jehovah , his name .
DARBY	Exodus	15	4	Pharaoh 's chariots and his army hath he cast into the sea ; His chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea .
DARBY	Exodus	15	5	The depths covered them ; they sank to the bottom as a stone .
DARBY	Exodus	15	6	Thy right hand , Jehovah , is become glorious in power : Thy right hand , Jehovah , hath dashed in pieces the enemy .
DARBY	Exodus	15	7	And by the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown thine adversaries : Thou sentest forth thy burning wrath , it consumed them as stubble .
DARBY	Exodus	15	8	And by the breath of thy nostrils the waters were heaped up ; The streams stood as a mound ; The depths were congealed in the heart of the sea .
DARBY	Exodus	15	9	The enemy said , I will pursue , I will overtake , I will divide the spoil ; my soul shall be sated upon them ; I will unsheath my sword , my hand shall dispossess them .
DARBY	Exodus	15	10	Thou didst blow with thy breath , the sea covered them ; They sank as lead in the mighty waters .
DARBY	Exodus	15	11	Who is like unto thee , Jehovah , among the gods ? Who is like unto thee , glorifying thyself in holiness , Fearful [ in ] praises , doing wonders ?
DARBY	Exodus	15	12	Thou stretchedst out thy right hand , the earth swallowed them .
DARBY	Exodus	15	13	Thou by thy mercy hast led forth the people that thou hast redeemed ; Thou hast guided them by thy strength unto the abode of thy holiness .
DARBY	Exodus	15	14	The peoples heard it , they were afraid : A thrill seized the inhabitants of Philistia .
DARBY	Exodus	15	16	Fear and dread fall upon them ; By the greatness of thine arm they are still as a stone ; Till thy people pass over , Jehovah , Till the people pass over that thou hast purchased .
DARBY	Exodus	15	17	Thou shalt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance , The place that thou , Jehovah , hast made thy dwelling , The Sanctuary , Lord , that thy hands have prepared .
DARBY	Exodus	15	18	Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever !
DARBY	Exodus	15	19	For the horse of Pharaoh , with his chariots and with his horsemen , came into the sea , and Jehovah brought again the waters of the sea upon them ; and the children of Israel went on dry [ ground ] through the midst of the sea .
DARBY	Exodus	15	20	And Miriam the prophetess , the sister of Aaron , took the tambour in her hand , and all the women went out after her with tambours and with dances .
DARBY	Exodus	15	21	And Miriam answered them , Sing to Jehovah , for he is highly exalted : The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea .
DARBY	Exodus	15	22	And Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
DARBY	Exodus	15	23	And they came to Marah , and could not drink the waters of Marah , for they were bitter ; therefore the name of it was called Marah .
DARBY	Exodus	15	24	And the people murmured against Moses , saying , What shall we drink ?
DARBY	Exodus	15	25	And he cried to Jehovah ; and Jehovah shewed him wood , and he cast it into the waters , and the waters became sweet . There he made for them a statute and an ordinance ; and there he tested them .
DARBY	Exodus	15	26	And he said , If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God , and do what is right in his eyes , and incline thine ears to his commandments , and keep all his statutes , I will put none of the complaints upon thee that I have put upon the Egyptians ; for I am Jehovah who healeth thee .
DARBY	Exodus	15	27	And they came to Elim ; and twelve springs of water were there , and seventy palm trees ; and they encamped there by the waters .
DARBY	Exodus	16	16	This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded : Gather of it every man according to what he can eat , an omer a poll , [ according to ] the number of your persons : ye shall take every man for those that are in his tent .
DARBY	Exodus	16	2	And the whole assembly of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness .
DARBY	Exodus	16	3	And the children of Israel said to them , Would that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt , when we sat by the flesh-pots , when we ate bread to the full ; for ye have brought us out into this wilderness , to kill this whole congregation with hunger !
DARBY	Exodus	16	4	Then said Jehovah to Moses , Behold , I will rain bread from heaven for you ; and the people shall go out and gather the daily need on its day , that I may prove them , whether they will walk in my law , or not .
DARBY	Exodus	16	5	And it shall come to pass on the sixth day , that they shall prepare what they have brought in ; and it shall be twice as much as they shall gather daily .
DARBY	Exodus	16	6	And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel , In the evening , then shall ye know that Jehovah has brought you out from the land of Egypt ;
DARBY	Exodus	16	7	and in the morning , then shall ye see the glory of Jehovah ; for he has heard your murmurings against Jehovah ; —and what are we , that ye murmur against us ?
DARBY	Exodus	16	8	And Moses said , When Jehovah gives you in the evening flesh to eat , and in the morning bread to the full ; for Jehovah hears your murmurings which ye murmur against him … and what [ are ] we ? your murmurings are not against us , but against Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	16	9	And Moses spoke to Aaron , Say to all the assembly of the children of Israel , Come near into the presence of Jehovah ; for he has heard your murmurings .
DARBY	Exodus	16	10	And it came to pass , when Aaron spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel , that they turned toward the wilderness , and behold , the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud .
DARBY	Exodus	16	11	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Exodus	16	12	I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel : speak to them , saying , Between the two evenings ye shall eat flesh , and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread ; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Exodus	16	13	And it came to pass in the evening , that quails came up , and covered the camp ; and in the morning the dew lay round the camp .
DARBY	Exodus	16	14	And when the dew that lay [ round it ] was gone up , behold , on the face of the wilderness there was [ something ] fine , granular , fine as hoar-frost , on the ground .
DARBY	Exodus	16	15	And the children of Israel saw [ it ] , and said one to another , What is it ? for they did not know what it was . And Moses said to them , This is the bread which Jehovah has given you to eat .
DARBY	Exodus	16	17	And the children of Israel did so , and gathered , some much , some little .
DARBY	Exodus	16	18	And they measured with the omer : then he that gathered much had nothing over , and he that gathered little wanted nothing : they had gathered every man according to the measure of his eating .
DARBY	Exodus	16	19	And Moses said to them , Let no man leave [ any ] of it until the morning .
DARBY	Exodus	16	20	But they did not hearken to Moses ; and some men left of it until the morning ; then worms bred in it and it stank . And Moses was wroth with them .
DARBY	Exodus	16	21	And they gathered it every morning , every man as much as he could eat ; and when the sun became hot , it melted .
DARBY	Exodus	16	22	And it came to pass on the sixth day , that they gathered twice as much bread , two omers for one ; and all the princes of the assembly came and told Moses .
DARBY	Exodus	16	23	And he said to them , This is what Jehovah has said : To-morrow is the rest , the holy sabbath , of Jehovah : bake what ye will bake , and cook what ye will cook ; and lay up for yourselves all that remains over , to be kept for the morning .
DARBY	Exodus	16	24	And they laid it up for the morning , as Moses had commanded ; and it did not stink , neither was there any worm in it .
DARBY	Exodus	16	25	And Moses said , Eat it to-day ; for to-day is sabbath to Jehovah : to-day ye shall not find it in the field .
DARBY	Exodus	16	26	Six days shall ye gather it ; but on the seventh day is sabbath : on it there shall be none .
DARBY	Exodus	16	27	And it came to pass on the seventh day that there went out [ some ] from the people to gather [ it ] , and they found none .
DARBY	Exodus	16	28	And Jehovah said to Moses , How long do ye refuse to keep my commandments and my laws ?
DARBY	Exodus	16	29	See , for Jehovah hath given you the sabbath ; therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread for two days . Abide every man in his place : let no man go from his place on the seventh day .
DARBY	Exodus	16	30	And the people rested on the seventh day .
DARBY	Exodus	16	31	And the house of Israel called its name Manna ; and it was like coriander-seed , white ; and the taste of it was like cake with honey .
DARBY	Exodus	16	32	And Moses said , This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded : Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations ; that they may see the bread that I gave you to eat in the wilderness , when I brought you out of the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	16	33	And Moses said to Aaron , Take a pot , and put in it an omer full of manna , and deposit it before Jehovah , to be kept for your generations .
DARBY	Exodus	16	34	As Jehovah had commanded Moses , so Aaron deposited it before the Testimony , to be kept .
DARBY	Exodus	16	35	And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years , until they came into an inhabited land : they ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan .
DARBY	Exodus	16	36	Now an omer is the tenth [ part ] of an ephah .
DARBY	Exodus	17	17	And all the assembly of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin , according to their journeys , at the command of Jehovah ; and they encamped in Rephidim ; and there was no water for the people to drink .
DARBY	Exodus	17	2	And the people contended with Moses , and said , Give us water , that we may drink ! And Moses said to them , Why do ye dispute with me ? Why do ye tempt Jehovah ?
DARBY	Exodus	17	3	And the people thirsted there for water ; and the people murmured against Moses , and said , Why is it that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst ?
DARBY	Exodus	17	4	And Moses cried to Jehovah , saying , What shall I do with this people ? Yet a little , and they will stone me !
DARBY	Exodus	17	5	And Jehovah said to Moses , Go on before the people , and take with thee of the elders of Israel , and thy staff with which thou didst smite the river , take in thy hand , and go .
DARBY	Exodus	17	6	Behold , I will stand before thee there upon the rock on Horeb ; and thou shalt strike the rock , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink . And Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel .
DARBY	Exodus	17	7	And he called the name of the place Massah , and Meribah , because of the contention of the children of Israel , and because they had tempted Jehovah , saying , Is Jehovah among us , or not ?
DARBY	Exodus	17	8	And Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim .
DARBY	Exodus	17	9	And Moses said to Joshua , Choose us men , and go out , fight with Amalek ; to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand .
DARBY	Exodus	17	10	And Joshua did as Moses had said to him , to fight with Amalek ; and Moses , Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the hill .
DARBY	Exodus	17	11	And it came to pass when Moses raised his hand , that Israel prevailed ; and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed .
DARBY	Exodus	17	12	And Moses ' hands were heavy ; then they took a stone , and put [ it ] under him , and he sat on it ; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands , one on this side , and one on that side ; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun .
DARBY	Exodus	17	13	And Joshua broke the power of Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword .
DARBY	Exodus	17	14	And Jehovah said to Moses , Write this [ for ] a memorial in the book , and rehearse [ it ] in the ears of Joshua , that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens .
DARBY	Exodus	17	15	And Moses built an altar , and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi .
DARBY	Exodus	17	16	And he said , For the hand is on the throne of Jah ; Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation !
DARBY	Exodus	18	18	Thou wilt be quite exhausted , both thou and this people that is with thee ; for the thing is too heavy for thee : thou canst not perform it alone .
DARBY	Exodus	18	2	And Jethro , Moses ' father-in-law , took Zipporah , Moses ' wife , after he had sent her back ,
DARBY	Exodus	18	3	and her two sons , of whom the name of the one was Gershom—for he said , I have been a sojourner in a foreign land ,
DARBY	Exodus	18	4	—and the name of the other , Eliezer—For the God of my father has been my help , and has delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh .
DARBY	Exodus	18	5	And Jethro , Moses ' father-in-law , came to Moses with his sons and his wife into the wilderness , where he encamped at the mountain of God .
DARBY	Exodus	18	6	And he sent word to Moses : I , thy father-in-law Jethro , am come to thee , and thy wife , and her two sons with her .
DARBY	Exodus	18	7	And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law , and did obeisance , and kissed him ; and they asked each other [ after ] their welfare , and went into the tent .
DARBY	Exodus	18	8	And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake ; all the trouble that had befallen them on the way , and [ how ] Jehovah had delivered them .
DARBY	Exodus	18	9	And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness that Jehovah had done to Israel ; that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians .
DARBY	Exodus	18	10	And Jethro said , Blessed be Jehovah , who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Pharaoh ; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
DARBY	Exodus	18	11	Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all gods ; for in the thing in which they acted haughtily [ he was ] above them .
DARBY	Exodus	18	12	And Jethro , Moses ' father-in-law , took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God ; and Aaron came , and all the elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses ' father-in-law in the presence of God .
DARBY	Exodus	18	13	And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses sat to judge the people ; and the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening .
DARBY	Exodus	18	14	And Moses ' father-in-law saw all that he did with the people , and said , What is this thing which thou art doing with the people ? why dost thou sit alone , and all the people are standing by thee from morning to evening ?
DARBY	Exodus	18	15	And Moses said to his father-in-law , Because the people come to me to enquire of God .
DARBY	Exodus	18	16	When they have a matter , they come to me , and I judge between one and another ; and I make known [ to them ] the statutes of God , and his laws .
DARBY	Exodus	18	17	And Moses ' father-in-law said to him , The thing that thou art doing is not good .
DARBY	Exodus	18	19	Hearken now to my voice : I will give thee counsel , and God shall be with thee . Be thou for the people with God , and bring the matters before God ;
DARBY	Exodus	18	20	and teach them the statutes and the laws , and make known to them the way in which they must walk , and the work that they must do .
DARBY	Exodus	18	21	But do thou provide among all the people able men , such as fear God , men of truth , hating covetousness ; and place [ them ] over them , chiefs of thousands , chiefs of hundreds , chiefs of fifties , and chiefs of tens ,
DARBY	Exodus	18	22	that they may judge the people at all times ; and it shall be [ that ] they shall bring to thee every great matter , and that they shall judge every small matter , and they shall lighten [ the task ] on thee , and they shall bear [ it ] with thee .
DARBY	Exodus	18	23	If thou do this thing , and God command thee [ so ] , thou wilt be able to endure , and all this people shall also go to their place in peace .
DARBY	Exodus	18	24	And Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law , and did all that he had said .
DARBY	Exodus	18	25	And Moses chose able men out of all Israel , and made them heads over the people , chiefs of thousands , chiefs of hundreds , chiefs of fifties , and chiefs of tens .
DARBY	Exodus	18	26	And they judged the people at all times : the hard matters they brought to Moses , but every small matter they judged .
DARBY	Exodus	18	27	And Moses sent away his father-in-law , and he departed into his land .
DARBY	Exodus	19	19	And the sound of the trumpet increased and became exceeding loud ; Moses spoke , and God answered him by a voice .
DARBY	Exodus	19	2	they departed from Rephidim , and came [ into ] the wilderness of Sinai , and encamped in the wilderness ; and Israel encamped there before the mountain .
DARBY	Exodus	19	3	And Moses went up to God , and Jehovah called to him out of the mountain , saying , Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel :
DARBY	Exodus	19	4	Ye have seen what I have done to the Egyptians , and [ how ] I have borne you on eagles ' wings and brought you to myself .
DARBY	Exodus	19	5	And now , if ye will hearken to my voice indeed and keep my covenant , then shall ye be my own possession out of all the peoples—for all the earth is mine—
DARBY	Exodus	19	6	and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests , and a holy nation . These are the words which thou shalt speak to the children of Israel .
DARBY	Exodus	19	7	And Moses came and called the elders of the people , and laid before the mall these words which Jehovah had commanded him .
DARBY	Exodus	19	8	And all the people answered together , and said , All that Jehovah has spoken will we do ! And Moses brought the words of the people back to Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	19	9	And Jehovah said to Moses , Lo , I will come to thee in the cloud 's thick darkness , that the people may hear when I speak with thee , and believe thee also for ever . And Moses told the words of the people to Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	19	10	And Jehovah said to Moses , Go to the people , and hallow them to-day and to-morrow , and let them wash their clothes ;
DARBY	Exodus	19	11	and let them be ready for the third day ; for on the third day Jehovah will come down before the eyes of all the people on mount Sinai .
DARBY	Exodus	19	12	And set bounds round about the people , saying , Take heed to yourselves , [ not ] to go up unto the mountain nor touch the border of it : whatever toucheth the mountain shall certainly be put to death :
DARBY	Exodus	19	13	not a hand shall touch it , but it shall certainly be stoned , or shot through ; whether it be a beast or a man , it shall not live . When the long drawn note of the trumpet soundeth , they shall come up to the mountain .
DARBY	Exodus	19	14	And Moses came down from the mountain to the people , and hallowed the people ; and they washed their clothes .
DARBY	Exodus	19	15	And he said to the people , Be ready for the third day ; do not come near [ your ] wives .
DARBY	Exodus	19	16	And it came to pass on the third day , when it was morning , that there were thunders and lightnings and a heavy cloud on the mountain , and the sound of the trumpet exceeding loud ; and the whole people that was in the camp trembled .
DARBY	Exodus	19	17	And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God ; and they stood at the foot of the mountain .
DARBY	Exodus	19	18	And the whole of mount Sinai smoked , because Jehovah descended on it in fire ; and its smoke ascended as the smoke of a furnace ; and the whole mountain shook greatly .
DARBY	Exodus	19	20	And Jehovah came down on mount Sinai , on the top of the mountain ; and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain , and Moses went up .
DARBY	Exodus	19	21	And Jehovah said to Moses , Go down , testify to the people that they break not through to Jehovah to gaze , and many of them perish .
DARBY	Exodus	19	22	And the priests also , who come near to Jehovah , shall hallow themselves , lest Jehovah break forth on them .
DARBY	Exodus	19	23	And Moses said to Jehovah , The people can not come up to mount Sinai ; for thou hast testified to us , saying , Set bounds about the mountain , and hallow it .
DARBY	Exodus	19	24	And Jehovah said to him , Go , descend , and thou shalt come up , thou , and Aaron with thee ; but the priests and the people shall not break through to go up to Jehovah , lest he break forth on them .
DARBY	Exodus	19	25	So Moses went down to the people , and told them .
DARBY	Exodus	20	20	And Moses said to the people , Fear not ; for God is come to prove you , and that his fear may be before you , that ye sin not .
DARBY	Exodus	20	2	I am Jehovah thy God , who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
DARBY	Exodus	20	3	Thou shalt have no other gods before me .
DARBY	Exodus	20	4	Thou shalt not make thyself any graven image , or any form of what is in the heavens above , or what is in the earth beneath , or what is in the waters under the earth :
DARBY	Exodus	20	5	thou shalt not bow down thyself to them , nor serve them ; for I , Jehovah thy God , am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and to the fourth [ generation ] of them that hate me ,
DARBY	Exodus	20	6	and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments .
DARBY	Exodus	20	7	Thou shalt not idly utter the name of Jehovah thy God ; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that idly uttereth his name .
DARBY	Exodus	20	8	Remember the sabbath day to hallow it .
DARBY	Exodus	20	9	Six days shalt thou labour , and do all thy work ;

DARBY	Exodus	20	11	For in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth , the sea , and all that is in them , and rested on the seventh day ; therefore Jehovah blessed the sabbath day , and hallowed it .

DARBY	Exodus	21	4	If his master have given him a wife , and she have borne him sons or daughters , the wife and her children shall be her master 's , and he shall go out alone .
DARBY	Exodus	21	5	But if the bondman shall say distinctly , I love my master , my wife , and my children , I will not go free ;

DARBY	Exodus	21	7	And if a man shall sell his daughter as a handmaid , she shall not go out as the bondmen go out .
DARBY	Exodus	21	8	If she is unacceptable in the eyes of her master , who had taken her for himself , then shall he let her be ransomed : to sell her unto a foreign people he hath no power , after having dealt unfaithfully with her .
DARBY	Exodus	21	9	And if he have appointed her unto his son , he shall deal with her after the law of daughters .
DARBY	Exodus	21	10	If he take himself another , her food , her clothing , and her conjugal rights he shall not diminish .

DARBY	Exodus	22	9	As to all manner of fraud , —as to ox , as to ass , as to sheep , as to clothing , as to everything lost , of which [ a man ] saith , It is this—the cause of both parties shall come before the judges : he whom the judges shall condemn shall restore double to his neighbour .
DARBY	Exodus	22	10	If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass , or an ox , or a sheep , or any cattle , to keep , and it die , or be hurt , or driven away , and no man see [ it ] ,

DARBY	Exodus	32	5	And Aaron saw [ it ] , and built an altar before it ; and Aaron made a proclamation , and said , To-morrow is a feast to Jehovah !
DARBY	Exodus	32	6	And they rose up early on the morrow , and offered up burnt-offerings , and brought peace-offerings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to sport .
DARBY	Exodus	32	7	Then Jehovah said to Moses , Away , go down ! for thy people , which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt , is acting corruptly .
DARBY	Exodus	32	8	They have turned aside quickly out of the way that I commanded them : they have made themselves a molten calf , and have bowed down to it , and have sacrificed thereunto , and said , This is thy god , Israel , who has brought thee up out of the land of Egypt !
DARBY	Exodus	32	9	And Jehovah said to Moses , I see this people , and behold , it is a stiff-necked people .
DARBY	Exodus	32	10	And now let me alone , that my anger may burn against them , and I may consume them ; and I will make of thee a great nation .
DARBY	Exodus	32	11	And Moses besought Jehovah his God , and said , Why , Jehovah , doth thy wrath burn against thy people , which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand ?
DARBY	Exodus	32	12	Why should the Egyptians speak , and say , For misfortune he has brought them out , to slay them on the mountains , and to annihilate them from the face of the earth ? Turn from the heat of thine anger , and repent of this evil against thy people !
DARBY	Exodus	32	13	Remember Abraham , Isaac and Israel , thy servants , to whom thou sworest by thyself , and saidst to them , I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven , and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed , and they shall possess [ it ] for ever !
DARBY	Exodus	32	14	And Jehovah repented of the evil that he had said he would do to his people .
DARBY	Exodus	32	15	And Moses turned and went down from the mountain , [ with ] the two tables of the testimony in his hand—tables written on both their sides : on this side and on that were they written .
DARBY	Exodus	32	16	And the tables [ were ] God 's work , and the writing was God 's writing , engraven on the tables .
DARBY	Exodus	32	17	And Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted , and said to Moses , There is a shout of war in the camp .
DARBY	Exodus	32	18	And he said , It is not the sound of a shout of victory , neither is it the sound of a shout of defeat : it is the noise of alternate singing I hear .
DARBY	Exodus	32	19	And it came to pass , when he came near the camp , and saw the calf and the dancing , that Moses ' anger burned , and he cast the tables out of his hands , and shattered them beneath the mountain .
DARBY	Exodus	32	20	And he took the calf that they had made , and burned [ it ] with fire , and ground it to powder , and strewed [ it ] on the water , and made the children of Israel drink [ it ] .
DARBY	Exodus	32	21	And Moses said to Aaron , What has this people done to thee , that thou hast brought so great a sin on them ?
DARBY	Exodus	32	22	And Aaron said , Let not the anger of my lord burn ! thou knowest the people , that they are [ set ] on mischief .
DARBY	Exodus	32	23	And they said to me , Make us a god , who will go before us ; for this Moses , the man that has brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we do not know what is become of him !
DARBY	Exodus	32	24	And I said to them , Who has gold ? They broke [ it ] off , and gave [ it ] me , and I cast it into the fire , and there came out this calf .
DARBY	Exodus	32	25	And Moses saw the people how they were stripped ; for Aaron had stripped them to [ their ] shame before their adversaries .
DARBY	Exodus	32	26	And Moses stood in the gate of the camp , and said , He that is for Jehovah , [ let him come ] to me . And all the sons of Levi gathered to him .
DARBY	Exodus	32	27	And he said to them , Thus saith Jehovah , the God of Israel : Put every man his sword upon his hip ; go and return from gate to gate through the camp , and slay every man his brother , and every man his friend , and every man his neighbour .
DARBY	Exodus	32	28	And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses ; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
DARBY	Exodus	32	29	And Moses said , Consecrate yourselves to-day to Jehovah , yea , every man with his son , and with his brother , and bring on yourselves a blessing to-day .
DARBY	Exodus	32	30	And it came to pass the next day , that Moses said to the people , Ye have sinned a great sin . And now I will go up to Jehovah : perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin .
DARBY	Exodus	32	31	And Moses returned to Jehovah , and said , Alas , this people has sinned a great sin , and they have made themselves a god of gold !
DARBY	Exodus	32	33	And Jehovah said to Moses , Whoever hath sinned against me , him will I blot out of my book .
DARBY	Exodus	32	34	And now go , lead the people whither I have told thee : behold , my Angel shall go before thee ; but in the day of my visiting I will visit their sin upon them .
DARBY	Exodus	32	35	And Jehovah smote the people , because they made the calf , which Aaron had made .
DARBY	Exodus	33	33	And Jehovah said to Moses , Depart , go up hence , thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt , into the land that I swore unto Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , Unto thy seed will I give it ,
DARBY	Exodus	33	2	( and I will send an angel before thee , and dispossess the Canaanite , the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , the Hivite , and the Jebusite , )
DARBY	Exodus	33	3	into a land flowing with milk and honey ; for I will not go up in the midst of thee , for thou art a stiff-necked people , —lest I consume thee on the way .
DARBY	Exodus	33	4	And when the people heard this evil word , they mourned ; and no man put on his ornaments .
DARBY	Exodus	33	5	Now Jehovah had said to Moses , Say unto the children of Israel , Ye are a stiff-necked people : in one moment I will come up into the midst of thee and will consume thee . And now put off thine ornaments from thee , and I will know what I will do unto thee .
DARBY	Exodus	33	6	And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments at mount Horeb .
DARBY	Exodus	33	7	And Moses took the tent , and pitched it outside the camp , far from the camp , and called it the Tent of meeting . And it came to pass [ that ] every one who sought Jehovah went out to the tent of meeting which was outside the camp .
DARBY	Exodus	33	8	And it came to pass , when Moses went out to the tent , all the people rose up , and stood every man at the entrance of his tent , and they looked after Moses until he entered into the tent .
DARBY	Exodus	33	9	And it came to pass when Moses entered into the tent , the pillar of cloud descended , and stood at the entrance of the tent , and [ Jehovah ] talked with Moses .
DARBY	Exodus	33	10	And all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent ; and all the people rose and worshipped , every man at the entrance of his tent .
DARBY	Exodus	33	11	And Jehovah spoke with Moses face to face , as a man speaks with his friend . And he returned to the camp ; but his attendant , Joshua the son of Nun , a young man , departed not from within the tent .
DARBY	Exodus	33	12	And Moses said to Jehovah , Behold , thou sayest unto me , Bring up this people ; but thou dost not let me know whom thou wilt send with me ; and thou hast said , I know thee by name , and thou hast also found grace in mine eyes .
DARBY	Exodus	33	13	And now , if indeed I have found grace in thine eyes , make me now to know thy way , that I may know thee , that I may find grace in thine eyes ; and consider that this nation is thy people !
DARBY	Exodus	33	14	And he said , My presence shall go , and I will give thee rest .
DARBY	Exodus	33	15	And he said to him , If thy presence do not go , bring us not up hence .
DARBY	Exodus	33	16	And how shall it be known then that I have found grace in thine eyes—I and thy people ? [ Is it ] not by thy going with us ? so shall we be distinguished , I and thy people , from every people that is on the face of the earth .
DARBY	Exodus	33	17	And Jehovah said to Moses , I will do this thing also that thou hast said ; for thou hast found grace in mine eyes , and I know thee by name .
DARBY	Exodus	33	18	And he said , Let me , I pray thee , see thy glory .
DARBY	Exodus	33	19	And he said , I will make all my goodness pass before thy face , and I will proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee ; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious , and I will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy .
DARBY	Exodus	33	20	And he said , Thou canst not see my face ; for Man shall not see me , and live .
DARBY	Exodus	33	21	And Jehovah said , Behold , [ there is ] a place by me : there shalt thou stand on the rock .
DARBY	Exodus	33	22	And it shall come to pass , when my glory passeth by , that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock , and will cover thee with my hand , until I have passed by .
DARBY	Exodus	33	23	And I will take away my hand , and thou shalt see me from behind ; but my face shall not be seen .
DARBY	Exodus	34	34	And when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him , he took the veil off , until he came out ; and he came out , and spoke to the children of Israel what he was commanded .
DARBY	Exodus	34	2	And be ready for the morning , and go up in the morning to mount Sinai , and stand there before me on the top of the mountain .
DARBY	Exodus	34	3	And let no man go up with thee , neither shall any man be seen on all the mountain ; neither shall sheep and oxen feed in front of that mountain .
DARBY	Exodus	34	4	And he hewed two tables of stone like the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up to mount Sinai , as Jehovah had commanded him , and took in his hand the two tables of stone .
DARBY	Exodus	34	5	And Jehovah came down in the cloud , and stood beside him there , and proclaimed the name of Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	34	6	And Jehovah passed by before his face , and proclaimed , Jehovah , Jehovah God merciful and gracious , slow to anger , and abundant in goodness and truth ,
DARBY	Exodus	34	7	keeping mercy unto thousands , forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin , but by no means clearing [ the guilty ] ; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children , and upon the children 's children , upon the third and upon the fourth [ generation ] .
DARBY	Exodus	34	8	And Moses made haste , and bowed his head to the earth and worshipped ,
DARBY	Exodus	34	9	and said , If indeed I have found grace in thine eyes , Lord , let the Lord , I pray thee , go in our midst ; for it is a stiff-necked people ; and pardon our iniquity and our sin , and take us for an inheritance !
DARBY	Exodus	34	10	And he said , Behold , I make a covenant : before all thy people I will do marvels that have not been done in all the earth , nor in any nation ; and all the people in the midst of which thou [ art ] shall see the work of Jehovah ; for a terrible thing it shall be that I will do with thee .
DARBY	Exodus	34	11	Observe what I command thee this day : behold , I will drive out before thee the Amorite , and the Canaanite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Hivite , and the Jebusite .
DARBY	Exodus	34	12	Take heed to thyself , that thou make no covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which thou shalt come , lest it be a snare in the midst of thee ;
DARBY	Exodus	34	13	but ye shall demolish their altars , shatter their statues , and hew down their Asherahs .
DARBY	Exodus	34	14	For thou shalt worship no other God ; for Jehovah—Jealous is his name—is a jealous God ;
DARBY	Exodus	34	15	lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land , and then , when they go a whoring after their gods , and sacrifice unto their gods , thou be invited , and eat of their sacrifice ,
DARBY	Exodus	34	16	and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons , and their daughters go a whoring after their gods , and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods .
DARBY	Exodus	34	17	—Thou shalt make thyself no molten gods .
DARBY	Exodus	34	18	—The feast of the unleavened bread shalt thou keep : seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread , as I have commanded thee , at the appointed time of the month Abib ; for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt .
DARBY	Exodus	34	19	—All that openeth the womb [ is ] mine ; and all the cattle that is born a male , the firstling of ox and sheep .
DARBY	Exodus	34	20	But the firstling of an ass thou shalt ransom with a lamb ; and if thou ransom [ it ] not , then shalt thou break its neck . All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt ransom ; and none shall appear before me empty .
DARBY	Exodus	34	21	—Six days shalt thou work , but on the seventh day thou shalt rest ; in ploughing time and in harvest thou shalt rest .
DARBY	Exodus	34	22	—And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks , of the first-fruits of wheat-harvest , and the feast of ingathering at the turn of the year .
DARBY	Exodus	34	23	Thrice in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord Jehovah , the God of Israel .
DARBY	Exodus	34	24	For I will dispossess the nations before thee , and enlarge thy border , and no man shall desire thy land , when thou goest up to appear before the face of Jehovah thy God thrice in the year .
DARBY	Exodus	34	25	—Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven ; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left over night until the morning .
DARBY	Exodus	34	26	—The first of the first-fruits of thy land shalt thou bring into the house of Jehovah thy God . Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother 's milk .
DARBY	Exodus	34	27	And Jehovah said to Moses , Write thee these words ; for after the tenor of these words have I made a covenant with thee and with Israel .
DARBY	Exodus	34	28	—And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights ; he ate no bread , and drank no water.—And he wrote on the tables the words of the covenant , the ten words .
DARBY	Exodus	34	29	And it came to pass , when Moses came down from mount Sinai—and the two tables of testimony were in Moses ' hand , when he came down from the mountain—that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone through his talking with him .
DARBY	Exodus	34	30	And Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , and behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come near him .
DARBY	Exodus	34	31	And Moses called to them ; and they turned to him , —Aaron and all the principal men of the assembly ; and Moses talked with them .
DARBY	Exodus	34	32	And afterwards , all the children of Israel came near ; and he gave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with him on mount Sinai .
DARBY	Exodus	34	33	And Moses ended speaking with them ; and he had put on his face a veil .
DARBY	Exodus	34	35	And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses , that the skin of Moses ' face shone ; and Moses put the veil on his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
DARBY	Exodus	35	35	he has filled them with wisdom of heart , to work all manner of work of the engraver , and of the artificer , and of the embroiderer , in blue , and in purple , in scarlet , and in byssus , and of the weaver , [ even ] of them that do every kind of work , and of those that devise artistic work
DARBY	Exodus	35	2	Six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day , a sabbath of rest to Jehovah : whoever does work on it shall be put to death .
DARBY	Exodus	35	3	Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your dwellings upon the sabbath day .
DARBY	Exodus	35	4	And Moses spoke to all the assembly of the children of Israel , saying , This is the word which Jehovah has commanded , saying ,
DARBY	Exodus	35	5	Take from among you a heave-offering to Jehovah : every one whose heart [ is ] willing , let him bring it , Jehovah 's heave-offering—gold , and silver , and copper ,
DARBY	Exodus	35	6	and blue , and purple , and scarlet , and byssus , and goats ' [ hair ] ,
DARBY	Exodus	35	7	and rams ' skins dyed red , and badgers ' skins , and acacia-wood ,
DARBY	Exodus	35	8	and oil for the light , and spices for the anointing oil , and for the incense of fragrant drugs ;
DARBY	Exodus	35	9	and onyx stones , and stones to be set for the ephod , and for the breastplate .
DARBY	Exodus	35	10	And all who are wise-hearted among you shall come and make all that Jehovah has commanded :
DARBY	Exodus	35	11	the tabernacle , its tent , and its covering , its clasps , and its boards , its bars , its pillars , and its bases ;
DARBY	Exodus	35	12	the ark , and its staves ; the mercy-seat , and the veil of separation ;
DARBY	Exodus	35	13	the table and its staves , and all its utensils , and the shewbread ;
DARBY	Exodus	35	14	and the lamp-stand for the light , and its utensils , and its lamps , and the oil for the light ;
DARBY	Exodus	35	15	and the altar of incense , and its staves ; and the anointing-oil , and the incense of fragrant drugs ; and the entrance-curtain at the entrance of the tabernacle ;
DARBY	Exodus	35	16	the altar of burnt-offering , and the copper grating for it , its staves , and all its utensils ; the laver and its stand ;
DARBY	Exodus	35	17	the hangings of the court , its pillars , and its bases , and the curtains of the gate of the court ;
DARBY	Exodus	35	18	the pegs of the tabernacle , and the pegs of the court , and their cords ;
DARBY	Exodus	35	19	the garments of service , to do service in the sanctuary , the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to serve as priests .
DARBY	Exodus	35	20	And all the assembly of the children of Israel departed from before Moses .
DARBY	Exodus	35	21	And they came , every one whose heart moved him , and every one whose spirit prompted him ; they brought Jehovah 's heave-offering for the work of the tent of meeting , and for all its service , and for the holy garments .
DARBY	Exodus	35	22	And they came , both men and women ; every one who was of willing heart brought nose-rings , and earrings , and rings , and bracelets , all kinds of utensils of gold : every man that waved a wave-offering of gold to Jehovah .
DARBY	Exodus	35	23	And every man with whom was found blue , and purple , and scarlet , and byssus , and goats ' [ hair ] , and rams ' skins dyed red , and badgers ' skins , brought [ them ] .
DARBY	Exodus	35	24	All they that offered a heave-offering of silver and copper brought Jehovah 's heave-offering . And every one with whom was found acacia-wood for all manner of work of the service , brought [ it ] .
DARBY	Exodus	35	25	And every woman that was wise-hearted spun with her hands , and brought what she had spun : the blue , and the purple , and the scarlet , and the byssus .
DARBY	Exodus	35	26	And all the women whose heart moved them in wisdom spun goats ' [ hair ] .
DARBY	Exodus	35	27	And the principal men brought the onyx stones , and the stones to be set , for the ephod , and for the breastplate ;
DARBY	Exodus	35	28	and the spice , and the oil for the light , and for the anointing oil , and for the incense of fragrant drugs .
DARBY	Exodus	35	29	The children of Israel brought a voluntary offering to Jehovah , every man and woman whose heart prompted them to bring for all manner of work , which Jehovah , by the hand of Moses , had commanded to be done .
DARBY	Exodus	35	30	And Moses said to the children of Israel , See , Jehovah has called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah ,
DARBY	Exodus	35	31	and he has filled him with the spirit of God , in wisdom , in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship ,
DARBY	Exodus	35	32	and to devise artistic things : to work in gold , and in silver , and in copper ,
DARBY	Exodus	35	33	and in cutting of stones , for setting , and in carving of wood , to execute all artistic work ;
DARBY	Exodus	35	34	and he has put in his heart to teach , he and Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan :
DARBY	Exodus	36	36	And he made four pillars of acacia [ -wood ] for it , and overlaid them with gold ; their hooks were of gold ; and he cast for them four bases of silver .
DARBY	Exodus	36	2	And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab , and every man that was wise-hearted , in whose heart God had put wisdom , every one whose heart moved him to come to the work to do it .
DARBY	Exodus	36	3	And they took from Moses every heave-offering that the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary , to make it . And they still brought him voluntary offerings morning by morning .
DARBY	Exodus	36	4	And all the wise men that wrought all the work of the sanctuary came , every man from his work which they wrought ,
DARBY	Exodus	36	5	and spoke to Moses , saying , The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work that Jehovah commanded to be done .
DARBY	Exodus	36	6	Then Moses gave commandment , and they caused it to be proclaimed through the camp , saying , Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the heave-offering of the sanctuary ! So the people were restrained from bringing ;
DARBY	Exodus	36	7	for the work they had was sufficient for all the work to do it , and it was too much .
DARBY	Exodus	36	8	And every wise-hearted man among those that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of twined byssus , and blue , and purple , and scarlet : [ with ] cherubim of artistic work did he make them .
DARBY	Exodus	36	9	The length of one curtain was twenty-eight cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits—one measure for all the curtains .
DARBY	Exodus	36	10	And he coupled five of the curtains one to another , and [ the other ] five curtains coupled he one to another .
DARBY	Exodus	36	11	And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain at the edge of the coupling ; he did likewise in the edge of the outermost curtain in the other coupling .
DARBY	Exodus	36	12	He made fifty loops in one curtain , and he made fifty loops at the end of the curtain that was in the other coupling : the loops were opposite to one another .
DARBY	Exodus	36	13	And he made fifty clasps of gold , and coupled the curtains together with the clasps , so that the tabernacle became one .
DARBY	Exodus	36	14	And he made curtains of goats ' [ hair ] for the tent over the tabernacle : eleven curtains did he make them .
DARBY	Exodus	36	15	The length of one curtain was thirty cubits , and four cubits the breadth of one curtain—one measure for the eleven curtains .
DARBY	Exodus	36	16	And he coupled five of the curtains by themselves , and six of the curtains by themselves .
DARBY	Exodus	36	17	And he made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain in the coupling , and fifty loops made he on the edge of the curtain in the other coupling .
DARBY	Exodus	36	18	And he made fifty clasps of copper to couple the tent , that it might be one .
DARBY	Exodus	36	19	And he made a covering for the tent [ of ] rams ' skins dyed red , and a covering of badgers ' skins above [ that ] .
DARBY	Exodus	36	20	And he made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia-wood , standing up ;
DARBY	Exodus	36	21	ten cubits the length of the boards , and one cubit and a half the breadth of one board ;
DARBY	Exodus	36	22	two tenons in one board , connected one with the other : thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
DARBY	Exodus	36	23	And he made the boards for the tabernacle : twenty boards for the south side southward ;
DARBY	Exodus	36	24	and he made forty bases of silver under the twenty boards , two bases under one board , for its two tenons , and two bases under another board for its two tenons .
DARBY	Exodus	36	25	And for the other side of the tabernacle , on the side toward the north , he made twenty boards ,
DARBY	Exodus	36	26	and their forty bases of silver , two bases under one board , and two bases under another board .
DARBY	Exodus	36	27	And at the rear of the tabernacle , westward , he made six boards ;
DARBY	Exodus	36	28	and he made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle at the rear ;
DARBY	Exodus	36	29	and they were joined beneath , and were coupled together at the top thereof into one ring : thus he did to both of them in both the corners ;
DARBY	Exodus	36	30	and there were eight boards , and their silver bases : sixteen bases , under every board two bases .
DARBY	Exodus	36	31	—And he made bars of acacia-wood : five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle ,
DARBY	Exodus	36	32	and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle , and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle at the rear , westward .
DARBY	Exodus	36	33	And he made the middle bar in the midst of the boards reach from one end to the other .
DARBY	Exodus	36	34	And he overlaid the boards with gold ; and made their rings of gold [ as ] receptacles for the bars ; and overlaid the bars with gold .
DARBY	Exodus	36	35	And he made the veil of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and twined byssus : of artistic work he made it [ with ] cherubim .
DARBY	Exodus	36	37	And he made a curtain for the entrance of the tent of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and twined byssus , of embroidery ;
DARBY	Exodus	36	38	and its five pillars with their hooks ; and he overlaid their capitals and their connecting-rods with gold ; and their five bases were of copper .
DARBY	Exodus	37	37	And Bezaleel made the ark of acacia-wood ; two cubits and a half the length thereof , and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof .
DARBY	Exodus	37	2	And he overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside , and made a border of gold upon it round about .
DARBY	Exodus	37	3	And he cast for it four rings of gold , for its four corners : two rings on the one side of it , and two rings on the other side of it .
DARBY	Exodus	37	4	And he made staves of acacia-wood and overlaid them with gold .
DARBY	Exodus	37	5	And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark , to carry the ark .
DARBY	Exodus	37	6	—And he made a mercy-seat of pure gold ; two cubits and a half the length thereof , and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof .
DARBY	Exodus	37	7	And he made two cherubim of gold ; of beaten work did he make them , at the two ends of the mercy-seat ;
DARBY	Exodus	37	8	one cherub at the end of one side , and one cherub at the end of the other side ; out of the mercy-seat he made the two cherubim at the two ends thereof .
DARBY	Exodus	37	9	And the cherubim spread out [ their ] wings over it , covering over with their wings the mercy-seat ; and their faces were opposite to one another : the faces of the cherubim were [ turned ] toward the mercy-seat .
DARBY	Exodus	37	10	And he made the table of acacia-wood ; two cubits the length thereof , and a cubit the breadth thereof , and a cubit and a half the height thereof .
DARBY	Exodus	37	11	And he overlaid it with pure gold , and made upon it a border of gold round about .
DARBY	Exodus	37	12	And he made for it a margin of a hand-breadth round about ; and made a border of gold for the margin thereof round about .
DARBY	Exodus	37	13	And he cast for it four rings of gold , and put the rings on the four corners that were on the four feet thereof .
DARBY	Exodus	37	14	Close to the margin were the rings , as receptacles of the staves to carry the table .
DARBY	Exodus	37	15	And he made the staves of acacia-wood , and overlaid them with gold , to carry the table .
DARBY	Exodus	37	16	And he made the utensils that were on the table , the dishes thereof , and the cups thereof , and the bowls thereof , and the goblets with which to pour out , of pure gold .
DARBY	Exodus	37	17	And he made the candlestick of pure gold ; [ of ] beaten work he made the candlestick : its base , and its shaft , its cups , its knobs , and its flowers were of itself .
DARBY	Exodus	37	18	And six branches went out of the sides thereof—three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof , and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof ;
DARBY	Exodus	37	19	[ there were ] three cups shaped like almonds in the one branch , a knob and a flower ; and three cups shaped like almonds in the other branch , a knob and a flower : so in the six branches which went out of the candlestick .
DARBY	Exodus	37	20	And in the candlestick were four cups , shaped like almonds , its knobs , and its flowers ;
DARBY	Exodus	37	21	and a knob under two branches thereof , and [ again ] a knob under two branches thereof , and [ again ] a knob under two branches thereof , for the six branches which went out of it .

DARBY	Leviticus	5	19	It is a trespass-offering : he hath certainly trespassed against Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	6	6	And his trespass-offering shall he bring to Jehovah , a ram without blemish out of the small cattle according to thy valuation , as a trespass-offering , unto the priest .
DARBY	Leviticus	6	2	If any one sin and act unfaithfully against Jehovah , and lie to his neighbour as to an entrusted thing or a deposit or [ that in which ] he hath robbed or wronged his neighbour ,
DARBY	Leviticus	6	3	or have found what was lost , and denieth it , and sweareth falsely in anything of all that man doeth , sinning therein ;
DARBY	Leviticus	6	4	then it shall be , if he hath sinned and transgressed , that he shall restore what he robbed or that in which he hath defrauded , or the deposit , or the lost thing which he found ,
DARBY	Leviticus	6	5	or all that about which he hath sworn falsely ; and he shall restore it in the principal , and shall add the fifth part more thereto ; to [ him to ] whom it belongeth shall he give it , on the day of his trespass-offering .

DARBY	Leviticus	6	10	And the priest shall put on his linen raiment , and his linen breeches shall he put on his flesh , and take up the ashes to which the fire hath consumed the burnt-offering on the altar , and he shall put them beside the altar .
DARBY	Leviticus	6	11	And he shall put off his garments , and put on other garments , and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place .

DARBY	Leviticus	7	14	And of it he shall present one out of the whole offering as a heave-offering to Jehovah ; to the priest that sprinkleth the blood of the peace-offering , to him it shall belong .
DARBY	Leviticus	7	15	And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offering of thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is presented ; he shall not let any of it remain until the morning .
DARBY	Leviticus	7	16	And if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow , or voluntary , it shall be eaten the same day that he presented his sacrifice ; on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten ;
DARBY	Leviticus	7	17	and the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire .
DARBY	Leviticus	7	18	And if [ any ] of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offering be eaten at all on the third day , it shall not be accepted , it shall not be reckoned to him that hath presented it ; it shall be an unclean thing , and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity .

DARBY	Leviticus	8	28	And Moses took them from off their hands , and burned [ them ] on the altar , over the burnt-offering : they were a consecration-offering for a sweet odour : it was an offering by fire to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	8	29	And Moses took the breast , and waved it as a wave-offering before Jehovah ; of the ram of consecration it was Moses ' part ; as Jehovah had commanded Moses .

DARBY	Leviticus	9	24	And there went out fire from before Jehovah , and consumed on the altar the burnt-offering , and the pieces of fat ; and all the people saw it , and they shouted , and fell on their face .
DARBY	Leviticus	10	10	that ye may put difference between the holy and the unholy , and between unclean and clean ,
DARBY	Leviticus	10	2	And there went out fire from before Jehovah , and devoured them , and they died before Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	10	3	And Moses said to Aaron , This is what Jehovah spoke , saying , I will be hallowed in them that come near me , and before all the people I will be glorified . And Aaron was silent .
DARBY	Leviticus	10	4	And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan , the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron , and said to them , Come near , carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp .
DARBY	Leviticus	10	5	And they went near , and carried them in their vests out of the camp , as Moses had said .
DARBY	Leviticus	10	6	And Moses said to Aaron , and to Eleazar and to Ithamar his sons , Your heads shall ye not uncover , neither rend your clothes ; lest ye die , and lest wrath come on all the assembly ; but your brethren , the whole house of Israel , shall bewail the burning which Jehovah hath kindled .
DARBY	Leviticus	10	7	And ye shall not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting , lest ye die ; for the anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you . And they did according to the word of Moses .
DARBY	Leviticus	10	8	And Jehovah spoke to Aaron , saying ,
DARBY	Leviticus	10	9	Thou shalt not drink wine nor strong drink , thou , and thy sons with thee , when ye go into the tent of meeting , lest ye die— [ it is ] an everlasting statute throughout your generations ,
DARBY	Leviticus	10	11	and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah hath spoken to them by the hand of Moses .
DARBY	Leviticus	10	12	And Moses spoke to Aaron , and to Eleazar and to Ithamar , his sons that were left , Take the oblation that is left of Jehovah 's offerings by fire , and eat it with unleavened bread beside the altar ; for it is most holy .
DARBY	Leviticus	10	13	And ye shall eat it in a holy place , because it is thy due , and thy sons ' due , of Jehovah 's offerings by fire ; for so I am commanded .
DARBY	Leviticus	10	14	And the breast of the wave-offering , and the shoulder of the heave-offering shall ye eat in a clean place , thou , and thy sons , and thy daughters with thee ; for [ as ] thy due , and thy sons ' due , are they given of the sacrifices of peace-offerings of the children of Israel .
DARBY	Leviticus	10	15	The shoulder of the heave-offering and the breast of the wave-offering shall they bring , with the fire-offering of the pieces of fat , to wave [ them ] as a wave-offering before Jehovah ; and they shall be thine , and thy sons ' with thee , for an everlasting statute , as Jehovah has commanded .
DARBY	Leviticus	10	16	And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering , and behold , it was burnt up : then he was wroth with Eleazar and Ithamar , the sons of Aaron that were left , saying ,
DARBY	Leviticus	10	17	Why have ye not eaten the sin-offering in a holy place ? for it is most holy , and he has given it to you that ye might bear the iniquity of the assembly , to make atonement for them before Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	10	18	Lo , its blood was not brought in within the sanctuary : ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary , as I commanded .
DARBY	Leviticus	10	19	And Aaron said to Moses , Behold , to-day have they presented their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before Jehovah ; and such things have befallen me ; and had I to-day eaten the sin-offering , would it have been good in the sight of Jehovah ?
DARBY	Leviticus	10	20	And Moses heard it ; and it was good in his sight .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	11	They shall be even an abomination unto you : of their flesh shall ye not eat , and their carcase ye shall have in abomination .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	2	Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , These are the animals which ye shall eat of all the beasts which are on the earth .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	3	Whatever hath cloven hoofs , and feet quite split open , and cheweth the cud , among the beasts—that shall ye eat .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	4	Only these shall ye not eat of those that chew the cud , or of those with cloven hoofs : the camel , for it cheweth the cud , but hath not cloven hoofs—it shall be unclean unto you ;
DARBY	Leviticus	11	5	and the rock-badger , for it cheweth the cud , but hath not cloven hoofs—it shall be unclean unto you ;
DARBY	Leviticus	11	6	and the hare , for it cheweth the cud , but hath not cloven hoofs—it shall be unclean unto you ;
DARBY	Leviticus	11	7	and the swine , for it hath cloven hoofs , and feet quite split open , but it cheweth not the cud—it shall be unclean unto you .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	8	Of their flesh shall ye not eat , and their carcase shall ye not touch : they shall be unclean unto you .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	9	These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters : whatever hath fins and scales in waters , in seas and in rivers , these shall ye eat ;
DARBY	Leviticus	11	10	but all that have not fins and scales in seas and in rivers , of all that swarm in the waters , and of every living soul which is in the waters—they shall be an abomination unto you .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	12	Whatever in the waters hath no fins and scales , that shall be an abomination unto you .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	13	And these shall ye have in abomination of the fowls ; they shall not be eaten ; an abomination shall they be : the eagle , and the ossifrage , and the sea-eagle ,
DARBY	Leviticus	11	14	and the falcon , and the kite , after its kind ;
DARBY	Leviticus	11	15	every raven after its kind ;
DARBY	Leviticus	11	16	and the female ostrich and the male ostrich , and the sea-gull , and the hawk , after its kind ;
DARBY	Leviticus	11	17	and the owl , and the gannet , and the ibis ,
DARBY	Leviticus	11	18	and the swan , and the pelican , and the carrion vulture ,
DARBY	Leviticus	11	19	and the stork ; the heron after its kind , and the hoopoe , and the bat .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	20	Every winged crawling thing that goeth upon all four shall be an abomination unto you .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	21	Yet these shall ye eat of every winged crawling thing that goeth upon all four : those which have legs above their feet with which to leap upon the earth .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	22	These shall ye eat of them : the arbeh after its kind , and the solam after its kind , and the hargol after its kind , and the hargab after its kind .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	23	But every winged crawling thing that hath four feet shall be an abomination unto you .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	24	And by these ye shall make yourselves unclean ; whoever toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	25	And whoever carrieth [ ought ] of their carcase shall wash his garments , and be unclean until the even .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	26	Every beast that hath cloven hoofs , but not feet quite split open , nor cheweth the cud , shall be unclean unto you : every one that toucheth them shall be unclean .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	27	And whatever goeth on its paws , among all manner of beasts that go upon all four , those are unclean unto you : whoever toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	28	And he that carrieth their carcase shall wash his garments , and be unclean until the even : they shall be unclean unto you .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	29	And these shall be unclean unto you among the crawling things which crawl on the earth : the mole , and the field-mouse , and the lizard , after its kind ;
DARBY	Leviticus	11	30	and the groaning lizard , and the great red lizard , and the climbing lizard , and the chomet , and the chameleon .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	31	These shall be unclean unto you among all that crawl : whoever toucheth them when they are dead , shall be unclean until the even .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	32	And on whatever any of them when they are dead doth fall , it shall be unclean ; all vessels of wood , or garment , or skin , or sack , every vessel wherewith work is done—it shall be put into water , and be unclean until the even ; then shall it be clean .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	33	And every earthen vessel into which [ any ] of them falleth—whatever is in it shall be unclean ; and ye shall break it .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	34	All food that is eaten on which [ such ] water hath come shall be unclean ; and all drink that is drunk shall be unclean , in every [ such ] vessel .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	35	And everything where upon [ any part ] of their carcase falleth shall be unclean ; oven and hearth shall be broken down : they are unclean , and shall be unclean unto you .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	36	Nevertheless , a spring or a well , a quantity of water , shall be clean . But he that toucheth their carcase shall be unclean .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	37	And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing-seed which is to be sown , it shall be clean ;
DARBY	Leviticus	11	38	but if water have been put on the seed , and any part of their carcase fall thereon , it shall be unclean unto you .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	39	And if any beast which is to you for food die , he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	40	And he that eateth of its carcase shall wash his garments , and be unclean until the even : he also that carrieth its carcase shall wash his garments , and be unclean until the even .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	41	And every crawling thing which crawleth on the earth shall be an abomination ; it shall not be eaten .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	42	Whatever goeth on the belly , and whatever goeth on all four , and all that have a great many feet , of every manner of crawling thing which crawleth on the earth—these ye shall not eat ; for they are an abomination .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	43	Ye shall not make yourselves abominable through any crawling thing which crawleth , neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them , that ye should be defiled thereby .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	44	For I am Jehovah your God ; and ye shall hallow yourselves , and ye shall be holy ; for I am holy ; and ye shall not make yourselves unclean through any manner of crawling thing which creepeth on the earth .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	45	For I am Jehovah who brought you up out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : ye shall therefore be holy , for I am holy .
DARBY	Leviticus	11	46	This is the law of cattle , and of fowl , and of every living soul that moveth in the waters , and of every soul that crawleth on the earth ;
DARBY	Leviticus	11	47	to make a difference between the unclean and the clean , and between the beast that is to be eaten and the beast that is not to be eaten .
DARBY	Leviticus	12	12	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Leviticus	12	2	Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a woman conceive seed , and bear a male , then she shall be unclean seven days ; as in the days of the separation of her infirmity shall she be unclean .
DARBY	Leviticus	12	3	And on the eighth day shall the flesh of his foreskin be circumcised .
DARBY	Leviticus	12	4	And she shall continue thirty-three days in the blood of her cleansing ; no holy thing shall she touch , nor come into the sanctuary , until the days of her cleansing are fulfilled .
DARBY	Leviticus	12	5	And if she bear a female , then she shall be unclean two weeks , as in her separation ; and she shall continue sixty-six days in the blood of her cleansing .
DARBY	Leviticus	12	6	And when the days of her cleansing are fulfilled , for a son or for a daughter , she shall bring a yearling lamb for a burnt-offering , and a young pigeon or a turtle-dove for a sin-offering , to the entrance of the tent of meeting , unto the priest .
DARBY	Leviticus	12	7	And he shall present it before Jehovah , and make atonement for her ; and she shall be clean from the flux of her blood . This is the law for her that hath borne a male or a female .
DARBY	Leviticus	12	8	And if her hand can not find what is sufficient for a sheep , she shall bring two turtle-doves or two young pigeons ; one for a burnt-offering , and the other for a sin-offering ; and the priest shall make atonement for her ; and she shall be clean .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	13	and the priest looketh , and behold , the leprosy covereth all his flesh , he shall pronounce [ him ] clean [ that hath ] the sore ; it is all turned white ; he is clean .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	2	When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising or a scab , or bright spot , and it become in the skin of his flesh a sore [ as ] of leprosy , then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest , or unto one of his sons the priests .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	3	And when the priest looketh on the sore in the skin of the flesh , and the hair in the sore is turned white , and the sore looketh deeper than the skin of his flesh , it is the sore of leprosy ; and the priest shall look on him and pronounce him unclean .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	4	But if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh , and look not deeper than the skin , and the hair thereof be not turned white , the priest shall shut up [ him that hath ] the sore seven days .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	5	And the priest shall look on him the seventh day ; and behold , in his sight , the sore remaineth as it was , the sore hath not spread in the skin , then the priest shall shut him up seven days a second time .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	6	And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day , and behold , the sore is become pale and the sore hath not spread in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him clean ; it is a scab ; and he shall wash his garments and be clean .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	7	But if the scab have spread much in the skin , after that he hath been seen by the priest for his cleansing , he shall be seen by the priest again ;
DARBY	Leviticus	13	8	and the priest shall look on him , and behold , the scab hath spread in the skin ; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is leprosy .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	9	When a sore [ as ] of leprosy is in a man , he shall be brought unto the priest ;
DARBY	Leviticus	13	10	and the priest shall look on him , and behold , there is a white rising in the skin , and it hath turned the hair white , and a trace of raw flesh is in the rising :
DARBY	Leviticus	13	11	it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh ; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean , and he shall not shut him up , for he is unclean .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	12	But if the leprosy break out much in the skin , and the leprosy cover all the skin of [ him that hath ] the sore , from his head even to his foot , wherever the eyes of the priest look ,
DARBY	Leviticus	13	14	And on the day when raw flesh appeareth in him , he shall be unclean .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	15	And the priest shall look on the raw flesh , and shall pronounce him unclean : the raw flesh is unclean , it is leprosy .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	16	But if the raw flesh change again , and be turned white , he shall come unto the priest ;
DARBY	Leviticus	13	17	and the priest shall look on him , and behold , the sore is turned white ; then the priest shall pronounce [ him ] clean [ that hath ] the sore : he is clean .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	18	And the flesh—when in the skin thereof cometh a boil , and it is healed ,
DARBY	Leviticus	13	19	and there is in the place of the boil a white rising , or a white-reddish bright spot , it shall be shewn to the priest ;
DARBY	Leviticus	13	20	and the priest shall look on it , and behold , it looketh deeper than the skin , and the hair thereof is turned white ; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is the sore of leprosy broken out in the boil .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	21	But if the priest look on it , and behold , there are no white hairs therein , and it is not deeper than the skin , and is pale , the priest shall shut him up seven days ;
DARBY	Leviticus	13	22	and if it spread much in the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is the sore .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	23	But if the bright spot have remained in its place , [ and ] have not spread , it is the scar of the boil ; and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	24	Or if in the flesh , in the skin thereof , there is a burning inflammation , and the place of the inflammation become a bright spot white-reddish or white ,
DARBY	Leviticus	13	25	and the priest look on it , and behold , the hair is turned white in the bright spot , and it looketh deeper than the skin , it is a leprosy which is broken out in the inflammation ; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is the sore of leprosy .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	26	But if the priest look on it , and behold , there is no white hair in the bright spot , and it is no deeper than the skin , and is pale , the priest shall shut him up seven days .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	27	And the priest shall look on him the seventh day , and if it have spread much in the skin , the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is the sore of leprosy .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	28	But if the bright spot have remained in its place , [ and ] not spread in the skin , and is pale , it is the rising of the inflammation ; and the priest shall pronounce him clean ; for it is the scar of the inflammation .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	29	And if a man or a woman have a sore on the head or on the beard ,
DARBY	Leviticus	13	30	and the priest look on the sore , and behold , it looketh deeper than the skin , and there is in it yellow thin hair , then the priest shall pronounce him unclean ; it is a scall , the leprosy of the head or the beard .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	31	And if the priest look on the sore of the scall , and behold , it is not in sight deeper than the skin , and there is no black hair in it , the priest shall shut up [ him that hath ] the sore of the scall seven days .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	32	And when the priest looketh on the sore on the seventh day , and behold , the scall hath not spread , and there is in it no yellow hair , and the scall doth not look deeper than the skin ,
DARBY	Leviticus	13	33	he [ that hath the sore ] shall shave himself ; but the scall shall he not shave ; and the priest shall shut up [ him that hath ] the scall seven days a second time .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	34	And the priest shall look on the scall on the seventh day , and behold , the scall hath not spread in the skin , nor is in sight deeper than the skin , then the priest shall pronounce him clean ; and he shall wash his garments , and be clean .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	35	But if the scall have spread much in the skin after his cleansing ,
DARBY	Leviticus	13	36	and the priest shall look on him , and behold , the scall hath spread in the skin , the priest shall not seek for yellow hair : he is unclean .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	37	But if the scall have in his sight remained as it was , and there is black hair grown up therein , the scall is healed : he is clean ; and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	38	And if a man or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots , white bright spots ,
DARBY	Leviticus	13	39	and the priest look , and behold , there are in the skin of their flesh pale white spots , it is an eruption which is broken out in the skin : he is clean .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	40	And if a man 's hair have fallen off his head , he is bald : he is clean ;
DARBY	Leviticus	13	41	and if he have the hair fallen off from the part of the head towards his face , he is forehead-bald : he is clean .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	42	And if there be in the bald head , or bald forehead , a white-reddish sore , it is a leprosy which hath broken out in his bald head , or his bald forehead .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	43	And the priest shall look on it , and behold , the rising of the sore is white-reddish in his bald head , or in his bald forehead , like the appearance of the leprosy in the skin of the flesh ;
DARBY	Leviticus	13	44	he is a leprous man , he is unclean ; the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean ; his sore is in his head .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	45	And as to the leper in whom the sore is , —his garments shall be rent , and his head shall be uncovered , and he shall put a covering on his beard , and shall cry , Unclean , unclean !
DARBY	Leviticus	13	46	All the days that the sore shall be in him he shall be unclean : he is unclean ; he shall dwell apart ; outside the camp shall his dwelling be .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	47	And if a sore of leprosy is in a garment , in a woollen garment , or a linen garment ,
DARBY	Leviticus	13	48	either in the warp or in the woof of linen or of wool , or in a skin , or in anything made of skin ,
DARBY	Leviticus	13	49	and the sore is greenish or reddish in the garment , or in the skin , or in the warp , or in the woof , or in anything of skin , it is the sore of leprosy , and shall be shewn unto the priest .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	50	And the priest shall look on the sore , and shall shut up [ that which hath ] the sore seven days .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	51	And he shall see the sore on the seventh day : if the sore have spread in the garment , either in the warp or in the woof , or in a skin , in any work that may be made of skin , the sore is a corroding leprosy : it is unclean .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	52	And they shall burn the garment , or the warp or the woof , of wool or of linen , or anything of skin , wherein the sore is ; for it is a corroding leprosy : it shall be burned with fire .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	53	But if the priest look , and behold , the sore hath not spread in the garment , or in the warp , or in the woof , or in anything of skin ,
DARBY	Leviticus	13	54	then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the sore is , and he shall shut it up seven days a second time .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	55	And the priest shall look on the sore after the washing , and behold , if the sore have not changed its appearance , and the sore have not spread , it is unclean : thou shalt burn it with fire : it is a fretting sore on what is threadbare or where the nap is gone .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	56	But if the priest look , and behold , the sore hath become pale after the washing of it , then he shall rend it from the garment , or from the skin , or from the warp , or from the woof .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	57	And if it appear still in the garment , or in the warp , or in the woof , or in anything of skin , it is a [ leprosy ] breaking out : thou shalt burn with fire that wherein the sore is .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	58	But the garment , or the warp , or the woof , or whatever thing of skin which thou hast washed , and the sore departeth from them , it shall be washed a second time , and it is clean .
DARBY	Leviticus	13	59	This is the law of the sore of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen , or in the warp , or in the woof , or in anything of skin , to cleanse it , or to pronounce it unclean .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	14	And the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering , and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and on the thumb of his right hand , and on the great toe of his right foot .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	2	This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing : he shall be brought unto the priest ,
DARBY	Leviticus	14	3	and the priest shall go out of the camp ; and when the priest looketh , and behold , the sore of leprosy is healed in the leper ,
DARBY	Leviticus	14	4	then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two clean living birds , and cedar-wood , and scarlet , and hyssop .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	5	And the priest shall command that one bird be killed in an earthen vessel over running water :
DARBY	Leviticus	14	6	as to the living bird—he shall take it , and the cedar-wood , and the scarlet , and the hyssop , and dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water ;
DARBY	Leviticus	14	7	and he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times , and shall pronounce him clean , and shall let the living bird loose into the open field .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	8	And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his garments , and shave all his hair , and bathe in water , and he shall be clean ; and afterwards shall he come into the camp , and shall abide outside his tent seven days .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	9	And it shall come to pass on the seventh day , that he shall shave all his hair , his head , and his beard , and his eyebrows , even all his hair shall he shave , and he shall wash his garments , and shall bathe his flesh in water , and he is clean .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	10	And on the eighth day he shall take two he-lambs without blemish , and one yearling ewe-lamb without blemish , and three tenth parts of fine flour mingled with oil , for an oblation , and one log of oil .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	11	And the priest that cleanseth [ him ] shall present the man that is to be cleansed and those things before Jehovah , at the entrance of the tent of meeting .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	12	And the priest shall take one he-lamb , and present it for a trespass-offering , and the log of oil , and wave them as a wave-offering before Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	13	And he shall slaughter the he-lamb at the place where the sin-offering and the burnt-offering are slaughtered , in a holy place ; for as the sin-offering , so the trespass-offering is the priest 's : it is most holy .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	15	And the priest shall take of the log of oil , and pour it into his , the priest 's , left hand ;
DARBY	Leviticus	14	16	and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand , and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	17	And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put on the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and on the thumb of his right hand , and on the great toe of his right foot , upon the blood of the trespass-offering .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	18	And the remainder of the oil that is in the priest 's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed , and the priest shall make atonement for him before Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	19	And the priest shall offer the sin-offering , and make atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness ; and afterwards shall he slaughter the burnt-offering .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	20	And the priest shall offer the burnt-offering and the oblation upon the altar ; and the priest shall make atonement for him , and he shall be clean .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	21	But if he be poor , and his hand be not able to get it , then he shall take one lamb for a trespass-offering , for a wave-offering , to make atonement for him ; and one tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for an oblation ; and a log of oil ,
DARBY	Leviticus	14	22	and two turtle-doves , or two young pigeons , as his hand may be able to get : the one shall be a sin-offering , and the other a burnt-offering .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	23	And he shall bring them on the eighth day of his cleansing unto the priest , unto the entrance of the tent of meeting , before Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	24	And the priest shall take the he-lamb of the trespass-offering , and the log of oil , and the priest shall wave them as a wave-offering before Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	25	And he shall slaughter the he-lamb of the trespass-offering ; and the priest shall take of the blood of the trespass-offering , and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and on the great toe of his right foot .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	26	And the priest shall pour of the oil into [ his ] , the priest 's , left hand ,
DARBY	Leviticus	14	27	and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	28	And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and on the great toe of his right foot , upon the place of the blood of the trespass-offering .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	29	And the remainder of the oil that is in the priest 's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed , to make atonement for him before Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	30	And he shall offer one of the turtle-doves , or of the young pigeons , of what his hand was able to get ;
DARBY	Leviticus	14	31	of what his hand was able to get shall the one be a sin-offering , and the other a burnt-offering , with the oblation ; and the priest shall make atonement for him that is to be cleansed before Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	32	This is the law for him in whom is the sore of leprosy , whose hand can not get what is [ regularly prescribed ] in his cleansing .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	33	And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
DARBY	Leviticus	14	34	When ye come into the land of Canaan , which I give to you for a possession , and I put a leprous plague in a house of the land of your possession ,
DARBY	Leviticus	14	35	then he whose house it is shall come and tell the priest , saying , It seemeth to me like a plague in the house ;
DARBY	Leviticus	14	36	and the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest go into it to see the plague , that all that is in the house be not made unclean ; and afterwards the priest shall go in to see the house .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	37	And when he looketh on the plague , and behold , the plague is in the walls of the house , greenish or reddish hollows , and their look is deeper than the surface of the wall ,
DARBY	Leviticus	14	38	then the priest shall go out of the house to the entrance of the house , and shut up the house seven days .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	39	And the priest shall come again the seventh day , and when he looketh , and behold , the plague hath spread in the walls of the house ,
DARBY	Leviticus	14	40	then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is , and they shall cast them out of the city , in an unclean place .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	41	And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about , and they shall pour out the mortar that they have scraped off , out of the city in an unclean place .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	42	And they shall take other stones , and put them in the place of those stones ; and they shall take other mortar , and shall plaster the house .
DARBY	Leviticus	14	43	And if the plague come again , and break out in the house , after he hath taken away the stones , and after he hath scraped the house , and after it is plastered ,
DARBY	Leviticus	14	44	then the priest shall come , and when he looketh , and behold , the plague hath spread in the house , it is a corroding leprosy in the house : it is unclean .

DARBY	Leviticus	17	10	And every one of the house of Israel , or of the strangers who sojourn among them , that eateth any manner of blood , —I will set my face against the soul that hath eaten blood , and will cut him off from among his people ;
DARBY	Leviticus	17	11	for the soul of the flesh is in the blood ; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls , for it is the blood that maketh atonement for the soul .
DARBY	Leviticus	17	12	Therefore have I said unto the children of Israel , No soul of you shall eat blood , neither shall the stranger who sojourneth among you eat blood .
DARBY	Leviticus	17	13	And every one of the children of Israel , and of the strangers who sojourn among them , that catcheth in the hunt a beast or fowl that may be eaten , he shall pour out the blood thereof , and cover it with earth ;
DARBY	Leviticus	17	14	for as to the life of all flesh , its blood is the life in it ; and I have said unto the children of Israel , Of the blood of no manner of flesh shall ye eat , for the life of all flesh is its blood : whoever eateth it shall be cut off .
DARBY	Leviticus	17	15	And every soul that eateth of a dead carcase , or of that which was torn , be it one home-born , or a stranger , he shall wash his clothes , and bathe in water , and be unclean until the even : then he shall be clean .

DARBY	Leviticus	20	17	And if a man take his sister , his father 's daughter , or his mother 's daughter , and see her nakedness , and she see his nakedness , that is a disgrace ; and they shall be cut off before the eyes of the children of their people : he hath uncovered his sister 's nakedness ; he shall bear his iniquity .
DARBY	Leviticus	20	18	And if a man shall lie with a woman in her infirmity , and uncover her nakedness , her flux doth he lay bare , and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood ; and both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
DARBY	Leviticus	20	19	And the nakedness of thy mother 's sister , and of thy father 's sister shalt thou not uncover ; for he hath laid naked his near relation : they shall bear their iniquity .
DARBY	Leviticus	20	21	And if a man take his brother 's wife , it is an unclean thing : he hath uncovered his brother 's nakedness : they shall be childless .
DARBY	Leviticus	20	22	And ye shall observe all my statutes , and all mine ordinances , and do them , that the land whither I bring you to dwell therein vomit you not out .
DARBY	Leviticus	20	23	And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation which I am casting out before you ; for all these things have they done , and they became an abomination to me .
DARBY	Leviticus	20	24	And I have said unto you , Ye shall possess their land , and I will give it unto you for a possession ; a land flowing with milk and honey : I am Jehovah your God , who have separated you from the peoples .
DARBY	Leviticus	20	25	And ye shall make a separation between the clean beast and the unclean , and between the unclean fowl and the clean , and ye shall not make yourselves an abomination by beast , or by fowl , or by anything that creepeth on the ground which I have separated for you , declaring [ it ] as unclean .
DARBY	Leviticus	20	26	And ye shall be holy unto me ; for I Jehovah am holy , and have separated you from the peoples to be mine .
DARBY	Leviticus	20	27	And if there be a man or a woman in whom is a spirit of Python or of divination , they shall certainly be put to death : they shall stone them with stones ; their blood is upon them .
DARBY	Leviticus	21	21	No man of the seed of Aaron the priest that hath defect shall come near to present Jehovah 's offerings by fire : he hath a defect ; he shall not come near to present the bread of his God .
DARBY	Leviticus	21	2	except for his immediate relation , who is near unto him—for his mother , and for his father , and for his son , and for his daughter , and for his brother ;
DARBY	Leviticus	21	3	and for his sister , a virgin , that is near unto him , who hath had no husband , for her may he make himself unclean .
DARBY	Leviticus	21	4	He shall not make himself unclean [ who is ] a chief among his peoples , to profane himself .
DARBY	Leviticus	21	5	They shall not make any baldness upon their head , neither shall they shave off the corners of their beard , nor make any cuttings in their flesh .
DARBY	Leviticus	21	6	They shall be holy unto their God , and not profane the name of their God ; for they present Jehovah 's offerings by fire , the bread of their God ; therefore shall they be holy .
DARBY	Leviticus	21	7	They shall not take as wife a whore , or a dishonoured woman ; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband ; for he is holy unto his God .
DARBY	Leviticus	21	8	And thou shalt hallow him ; for the bread of thy God doth he present : he shall be holy unto thee ; for I , Jehovah , who hallow you am holy .
DARBY	Leviticus	21	9	And the daughter of any priest , if she profane herself by playing the whore , she profaneth her father : she shall be burned with fire .
DARBY	Leviticus	21	10	And the high priest among his brethren , on whose head the anointing oil was poured , and who is consecrated to put on the garments , shall not uncover his head , nor rend his garments .
DARBY	Leviticus	21	11	Neither shall he come near any person dead , nor make himself unclean for his father and for his mother ;
DARBY	Leviticus	21	12	neither shall he go out of the sanctuary , nor profane the sanctuary of his God ; for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him : I am Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	21	13	And he shall take a wife in her virginity .
DARBY	Leviticus	21	14	A widow , or a divorced woman , or a dishonoured one , a harlot , these shall he not take ; but he shall take as wife a virgin from among his peoples .
DARBY	Leviticus	21	15	And he shall not profane his seed among his peoples ; for I am Jehovah who do hallow him .
DARBY	Leviticus	21	16	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Leviticus	21	17	Speak unto Aaron , saying , Any of thy seed throughout their generations that hath any defect , shall not approach to present the bread of his God ;
DARBY	Leviticus	21	18	for whatever man hath a defect , he shall not approach : a blind man , or a lame , or he that hath a flat nose , or one limb longer than the other ,
DARBY	Leviticus	21	19	or a man that is broken-footed , or broken-handed ,
DARBY	Leviticus	21	20	or hump-backed , or withered , or that hath a spot in his eye , or hath the itch , or scabs , or his testicles broken .
DARBY	Leviticus	21	22	The bread of his God , of the most holy and of the holy , shall he eat ;
DARBY	Leviticus	21	23	only he shall not come in unto the veil , nor shall he draw near unto the altar ; for he hath a defect : that he profane not my sanctuaries ; for I am Jehovah who do hallow them .
DARBY	Leviticus	21	24	And Moses told it to Aaron , and to his sons , and to all the children of Israel .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	22	Blind , or broken , or maimed , or ulcerous , or with itch , or scabbed—ye shall not present these to Jehovah , nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	2	Speak unto Aaron , and to his sons , that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel , and that they profane not my holy name in the things that they hallow unto me : I am Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	3	Say unto them , Every one of all your seed , throughout your generations , that approacheth the holy things , which the children of Israel hallow unto Jehovah , having his uncleanness upon him , that soul shall be cut off from before me : I am Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	4	Whatsoever man of the seed of Aaron is a leper , or hath a flux , he shall not eat of the holy things , until he is clean . And he that toucheth any one that is unclean by a dead person , or a man whose seed of copulation hath passed from him ;
DARBY	Leviticus	22	5	or a man that toucheth any crawling thing whereby he becometh unclean , or a man by whom he may become unclean , whatever may be his uncleanness ,
DARBY	Leviticus	22	6	—a person that toucheth any such shall be unclean until even , and shall not eat of the holy things ; but he shall bathe his flesh with water ,
DARBY	Leviticus	22	7	and when the sun goeth down , he shall be clean , and may afterwards eat of the holy things ; for it is his food .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	8	Of a dead carcase and what is torn shall he not eat , to make himself unclean therewith : I am Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	9	And they shall keep my charge , lest they bear sin for it , and die by it , if they profane it : I am Jehovah who do hallow them .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	10	And no stranger shall eat the holy thing ; the sojourner with the priest , and the hired servant , shall not eat of the holy thing .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	11	But if a priest buy any one for money , he may eat of it , and he that is born in his house : they may eat of his food .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	12	And a priest 's daughter who is [ married ] to a stranger may not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	13	But a priest 's daughter that becometh a widow , or is divorced , and hath no seed , and returneth unto her father 's house , as in her youth , she may eat of her father 's food ; but no stranger shall eat thereof .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	14	And if a man eat of a holy thing through inadvertence , then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it , and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	15	And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel which they offer unto Jehovah ,
DARBY	Leviticus	22	16	and cause them to bear the iniquity of trespass when they eat their holy things ; for I am Jehovah who do hallow them .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	17	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Leviticus	22	18	Speak unto Aaron , and to his sons , and unto all the children of Israel , and say unto them , Whatever man of the house of Israel , or of the sojourners in Israel , that presenteth his offering for any of his vows , and for any of his voluntary offerings , which they present to Jehovah as a burnt-offering ,
DARBY	Leviticus	22	19	it shall be for your acceptance , without blemish , a male of the oxen , of the sheep , and of the goats .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	20	Nothing that hath a defect shall ye present ; for it shall not be acceptable for you .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	21	And if any present a sacrifice of peace-offering to Jehovah to accomplish a vow , or a voluntary offering of oxen or small cattle , it shall be without blemish to be accepted : there shall be no defect therein .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	23	A bullock and a sheep that hath a member too long or too short , that mayest thou offer as a voluntary offering ; but as a vow it shall not be accepted .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	24	That which is bruised , or crushed , or broken , or cut shall ye not present to Jehovah ; neither in your land shall ye do [ the like ] .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	25	Nor from the hand of the stranger shall ye present the bread of your God , of any of these ; for their corruption is in them : a defect is in them ; they shall not be accepted for you .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	26	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Leviticus	22	27	An ox , or a sheep , or a goat , when it is brought forth , shall be seven days under its dam ; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering by fire to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	28	A cow , or sheep—it and its young shall ye not slaughter in one day .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	29	And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Jehovah , ye shall sacrifice it for your acceptance .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	30	On that day shall it be eaten : ye shall leave none of it until morning : I am Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	31	And ye shall observe my commandments and do them : I am Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	22	32	And ye shall not profane my holy name ; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel : I am Jehovah who do hallow you ,
DARBY	Leviticus	22	33	who brought you out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : I am Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	23	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Leviticus	23	2	Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , [ Concerning ] the set feasts of Jehovah , which ye shall proclaim as holy convocations—these are my set feasts .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	3	Six days shall work be done ; but on the seventh day is the sabbath of rest , a holy convocation ; no manner of work shall ye do : it is the sabbath to Jehovah in all your dwellings .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	4	These are the set feasts of Jehovah , holy convocations , which ye shall proclaim in their seasons :
DARBY	Leviticus	23	5	In the first month , on the fourteenth of the month , between the two evenings , is the passover to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	6	And on the fifteenth day of this month is the feast of unleavened bread to Jehovah ; seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	7	On the first day ye shall have a holy convocation : no manner of servile work shall ye do .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	8	And ye shall present to Jehovah an offering by fire seven days ; on the seventh day is a holy convocation : no manner of servile work shall ye do .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	9	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Leviticus	23	10	Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them , When ye come into the land that I give unto you , and ye reap the harvest thereof , then ye shall bring a sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	11	And he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah , to be accepted for you ; on the next day after the sabbath the priest shall wave it .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	12	And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf , a he-lamb without blemish , a yearling , for a burnt-offering to Jehovah ;
DARBY	Leviticus	23	13	and the oblation thereof : two tenths of fine flour mingled with oil , an offering by fire to Jehovah for a sweet odour ; and the drink-offering thereof , of wine , a fourth part of a hin .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	14	And ye shall not eat bread , or roast corn , or green ears , until the same day that ye have brought the offering of your God : [ it is ] an everlasting statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	15	And ye shall count from the morning after the sabbath , from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering , seven weeks ; they shall be complete ;
DARBY	Leviticus	23	16	even unto the morning after the seventh sabbath shall ye count fifty days ; and ye shall present a new oblation to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	17	Out of your dwellings shall ye bring two wave-loaves , of two tenths of fine flour ; with leaven shall they be baken ; [ as ] first-fruits to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	18	And ye shall present with the bread seven he-lambs without blemish , yearlings , and one young bullock , and two rams : they shall be a burnt-offering to Jehovah with their oblation , and their drink-offerings , an offering by fire of a sweet odour to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	19	And ye shall sacrifice one buck of the goats for a sin-offering , and two he-lambs , yearlings , for a sacrifice of peace-offering .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	20	And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits as a wave-offering before Jehovah , with the two he-lambs ; they shall be holy to Jehovah , for the priest .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	21	And ye shall make proclamation on that same day—a holy convocation shall it be unto you : no manner of servile work shall ye do : [ it is ] an everlasting statute in all your dwellings throughout your generations .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	22	And when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not in thy harvest entirely reap the corners of thy field , and the gleaning of thy harvest shalt thou not gather : thou shalt leave them unto the poor and to the stranger : I am Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	24	Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , In the seventh month , on the first of the month , shall ye have a rest , a memorial of blowing of trumpets , a holy convocation .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	25	No manner of servile work shall ye do ; and ye shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	26	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Leviticus	23	27	Also on the tenth of this seventh month is the day of the atonement : a holy convocation shall it be unto you ; and ye shall afflict your souls , and present an offering by fire to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	28	And ye shall do no manner of work on that same day ; for it is a day of atonement , to make atonement for you before Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	29	For every soul that is not afflicted on that same day , shall be cut off from among his peoples .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	30	And every soul that doeth any manner of work on that same day , the same soul will I destroy from among his people .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	31	No manner of work shall ye do : [ it is ] an everlasting statute throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	32	A sabbath of rest shall it be unto you ; and ye shall afflict your souls . On the ninth of the month at even , from even unto even , shall ye celebrate your sabbath .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	33	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Leviticus	23	34	Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of booths seven days to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	35	On the first day there shall be a holy convocation : no manner of servile work shall ye do .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	36	Seven days ye shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah ; on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you ; and ye shall present an offering by fire to Jehovah : it is a solemn assembly ; no manner of servile work shall ye do .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	37	These are the set feasts of Jehovah , which ye shall proclaim as holy convocations , to present an offering by fire to Jehovah , a burnt-offering , and an oblation , a sacrifice , and drink-offerings , everything upon its day ;
DARBY	Leviticus	23	38	besides the sabbaths of Jehovah , and besides your gifts , and besides all your vows , and besides all your voluntary offerings , which ye give to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	39	But on the fifteenth day of the seventh month , when ye have gathered in the produce of the land , ye shall celebrate the feast of Jehovah seven days : on the first day there shall be rest , and on the eighth day there shall be rest .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	40	And ye shall take on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees , palm branches and the boughs of leafy trees , and willows of the brook ; and ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God seven days .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	41	And ye shall celebrate it as a feast to Jehovah seven days in the year : [ it is ] an everlasting statute throughout your generations ; in the seventh month shall ye celebrate it .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	42	In booths shall ye dwell seven days ; all born in Israel shall dwell in booths ;
DARBY	Leviticus	23	43	that your generations may know that I caused the children of Israel to dwell in booths , when I brought them out of the land of Egypt : I am Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Leviticus	23	44	And Moses declared the set feasts of Jehovah to the children of Israel .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	24	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Leviticus	24	2	Command the children of Israel that they bring unto thee pure beaten olive oil for the light , to light the lamp continually .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	3	Outside the veil of the testimony , in the tent of meeting , shall Aaron dress it from evening to morning before Jehovah continually : [ it is ] an everlasting statute throughout your generations .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	4	Upon the pure candlestick shall he arrange the lamps before Jehovah continually .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	5	And thou shalt take fine wheaten flour , and bake twelve cakes thereof ; each cake shall be of two tenths .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	6	And thou shalt set them in two rows , six in a row , upon the pure table before Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	7	And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row ; and it shall be a bread of remembrance , an offering by fire to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	8	Every sabbath day he shall arrange it before Jehovah continually , on the part of the children of Israel : [ it is ] an everlasting covenant .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	9	And it shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' ; and they shall eat it in a holy place ; for it is most holy unto him of Jehovah 's offerings by fire : [ it is ] an everlasting statute .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	10	And the son of an Israelitish woman—but withal the son of an Egyptian , —went out among the children of Israel ; and this son of the Israelitess and a man of Israel strove together in the camp ;
DARBY	Leviticus	24	11	and the Israelitish woman 's son blasphemed the Name , and cursed ; and they brought him to Moses . And his mother 's name was Shelomith , the daughter of Dibri , of the tribe of Dan .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	12	And they confined him , that they might decide at the mouth of Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	13	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Leviticus	24	14	Lead the reviler outside the camp ; and all that heard [ him ] shall lay their hands upon his head , and the whole assembly shall stone him .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	15	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , Every one when he revileth his God shall bear his sin .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	16	And he that blasphemeth the name of Jehovah shall certainly be put to death ; all the assembly shall certainly stone him ; as well the stranger as he that is home-born , when he blasphemeth the Name , shall be put to death .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	17	And if any one smiteth any man mortally , he shall certainly be put to death .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	18	And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good , life for life .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	19	And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour , as he hath done , so shall it be done to him ;
DARBY	Leviticus	24	20	breach for breach , eye for eye , tooth for tooth : as he hath caused a blemish in a man , so shall it be done to him .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	21	He that smiteth a beast [ mortally ] shall make it good ; and he that smiteth a man [ mortally ] shall be put to death .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	22	Ye shall have one law : as the stranger , so the home-born ; for I am Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Leviticus	24	23	And Moses spoke to the children of Israel ; and they led the reviler outside the camp and stoned him with stones . And the children of Israel did as Jehovah had commanded Moses .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	25	If thy brother grow poor , and sell of his possession , then shall his redeemer , his nearest relation , come and redeem that which his brother sold .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	2	Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them , When ye come into the land that I will give you , the land shall celebrate a sabbath to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	3	Six years shalt thou sow thy field , and six years shalt thou prune thy vineyard , and gather in the produce thereof ,
DARBY	Leviticus	25	4	but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest for the land , a sabbath to Jehovah . Thy field shalt thou not sow , and thy vineyard shalt thou not prune .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	5	That which springeth up from the scattered seed of thy harvest thou shalt not reap , and the grapes of thine undressed vines thou shalt not gather : a year of rest shall it be for the land .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	6	And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you , for thee , and for thy bondman , and for thy handmaid , and for thy hired servant , and for him that dwelleth as a sojourner with thee , and for thy cattle ,
DARBY	Leviticus	25	7	and for the beasts that are in thy land : all the produce thereof shall be for food .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	8	And thou shalt count seven sabbaths of years , seven times seven years ; so that the days of the seven sabbaths of years be unto thee forty-nine years .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	9	Then shalt thou cause the loud sound of the trumpet to go forth in the seventh month , on the tenth of the month ; on the day of atonement shall ye cause the trumpet to go forth throughout your land .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	10	And ye shall hallow the year of the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty in the land unto all the inhabitants thereof ; a [ year of ] jubilee shall it be unto you , and ye shall return every man unto his possession , and ye shall return every man unto his family ;
DARBY	Leviticus	25	11	a year of jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you : ye shall not sow , neither reap its aftergrowth , nor gather [ the fruit of ] its undressed vines .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	12	For it is the jubilee ; it shall be holy unto you ; out of the field shall ye eat its produce .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	13	In this year of the jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	14	And if ye sell ought unto your neighbour , or buy of your neighbour 's hand , ye shall not overreach one another .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	15	According to the number of years since the jubilee , thou shalt buy of thy neighbour ; according to the number of years of the produce , he shall sell unto thee .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	16	According to the greater number of the years , thou shalt increase the price thereof ; and according to the fewness of years , thou shalt diminish the price of it ; for it is the number of crops that he selleth unto thee .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	17	And ye shall not oppress one another ; but thou shalt fear thy God ; for I am Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	18	And ye shall do my statutes , and observe mine ordinances and do them : thus shall ye dwell in your land securely .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	19	And the land shall yield its fruit , and ye shall eat and be satisfied , and dwell therein securely .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	20	And if ye say , What shall we eat in the seventh year ? behold , we may not sow , nor gather in our produce ;
DARBY	Leviticus	25	21	then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year , that it may bring forth produce for three years ;
DARBY	Leviticus	25	22	and ye shall sow in the eighth year , and ye shall eat of the old fruit until the ninth year ; until her produce come in , ye shall eat the old .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	23	And the land shall not be sold for ever ; for the land is mine ; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	24	And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	26	And if the man have no one having right of redemption , and his hand have acquired and found what sufficeth for its redemption ,
DARBY	Leviticus	25	27	then shall he reckon the years since the sale thereof , and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it ; and so return unto his possession .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	28	And if his hand have not found what sufficeth for him to restore it to him , then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of the purchaser , until the year of jubilee ; and in the jubilee it shall go out , and he shall return unto his possession .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	29	And if any one sell a dwelling-house in a walled city , then he shall have the right of redemption up to the end of the year of the sale thereof ; for a full year shall he have the right of redemption .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	30	But if it be not redeemed until a whole year is complete , then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it , throughout his generations : it shall not go out in the jubilee .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	31	But the houses in villages that have no wall round about them shall be reckoned as the fields of the country : they may be redeemed , and they shall go out in the jubilee .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	32	But as to the cities of the Levites , the houses in the cities of their possession , the Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	33	And if any one redeem from one of the Levites , then the house that was sold , in the city of his possession , shall go out in the jubilee ; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	34	And the field of the suburbs of their cities shall not be sold ; for it is their perpetual possession .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	35	And if thy brother grow poor , and he be fallen into decay beside thee , then thou shalt relieve him , [ be he ] stranger or sojourner , that he may live beside thee .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	36	Thou shalt take no usury nor increase of him ; and thou shalt fear thy God ; that thy brother may live beside thee .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	37	Thy money shalt thou not give him upon usury , nor lend him thy victuals for increase .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	38	I am Jehovah your God , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Canaan , to be your God .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	39	And if thy brother grow poor beside thee , and be sold unto thee , thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant :
DARBY	Leviticus	25	40	as a hired servant , as a sojourner , shall he be with thee ; until the year of jubilee shall he serve thee .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	41	Then shall he depart from thee , he and his children with him , and shall return unto his own family , and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	42	For they are my bondmen , whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : they shall not be sold as [ men ] sell bondmen .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	43	Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour ; and thou shalt fear thy God .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	44	And as for thy bondman and thy handmaid whom thou shalt have—of the nations that are round about you , of them shall ye buy bondmen and handmaids .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	45	Moreover of the children of them that dwell as sojourners with you , of them may ye buy , and of their family that is with you , which they beget in your land , and they shall be your possession .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	46	And ye shall leave them as an inheritance to your children after you , to inherit them as a possession : these may ye make your bondmen for ever ; but as for your brethren , the children of Israel , ye shall not rule over one another with rigour .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	47	And if a stranger or sojourner become wealthy beside thee , and thy brother beside him grow poor , and sell himself unto the stranger , who is settled by thee , or to a scion of the stranger 's family ,
DARBY	Leviticus	25	48	after that he is sold there shall be right of redemption for him ; one of his brethren may redeem him .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	49	Either his uncle or his uncle 's son may redeem him , or one of his next relations of his family may redeem him ; or if his means be sufficient , he may redeem himself .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	50	And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubilee ; and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of the years , according to the days of a hired servant shall he be with him .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	51	If there are yet many years , according unto them shall he return his redemption [ money ] out of the money that he was bought for ;
DARBY	Leviticus	25	52	and if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee , then he shall reckon with him ; according unto his [ remaining ] years [ of service ] shall he give him back his redemption [ money ] .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	53	As a hired servant shall he be with him year by year ; [ his master ] shall not rule with rigour over him before thine eyes .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	54	And if he be not redeemed in this manner , then he shall go out in the year of jubilee , he and his children with him .
DARBY	Leviticus	25	55	For the children of Israel are servants unto me ; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : I am Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	26	When I break the staff of your bread , ten women shall bake your bread in one oven , and shall deliver you the bread again by weight ; and ye shall eat , and not be satisfied .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	2	Ye shall observe my sabbaths , and my sanctuary shall ye reverence : I am Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	3	If ye walk in my statutes , and observe my commandments and do them ,
DARBY	Leviticus	26	4	then I will give your rain in the season thereof , and the land shall yield its produce , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit ;
DARBY	Leviticus	26	5	and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage , and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing-time ; and ye shall eat your bread to the full , and dwell in your land securely .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	6	And I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid ; and I will put away the evil beasts out of the land ; and the sword shall not go through your land .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	7	And ye shall chase your enemies , and they shall fall before you by the sword ;
DARBY	Leviticus	26	8	and five of you shall chase a hundred , and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight ; and your enemies shall fall beside you by the sword .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	9	And I will turn my face towards you and make you fruitful , and multiply you , and establish my covenant with you .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	10	And ye shall eat old store , and clear away the old because of the new .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	11	And I will set my habitation among you ; and my soul shall not abhor you ;
DARBY	Leviticus	26	12	and I will walk among you , and will be your God , and ye shall be to me a people .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	13	I am Jehovah your God , who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that ye should not be their bondmen ; and I have broken the bands of your yoke , and made you walk upright .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	14	But if ye hearken not unto me , and do not all these commandments ,
DARBY	Leviticus	26	15	and if ye shall despise my statutes , and if your soul shall abhor mine ordinances , so that ye do not all my commandments , that ye break my covenant ,
DARBY	Leviticus	26	16	I also will do this unto you—I will even appoint over you terror , consumption , and fever , which shall cause the eyes to fail , and the soul to waste away ; and ye shall sow your seed in vain , for your enemies shall eat it .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	17	And I will set my face against you , that ye may be routed before your enemies ; they that hate you shall have dominion over you ; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	18	And if for this ye hearken not unto me , I will punish you sevenfold more for your sins ,
DARBY	Leviticus	26	19	and I will break the arrogance of your power ; and I will make your heaven as iron , and your earth as bronze ,
DARBY	Leviticus	26	20	and your strength shall be spent in vain , and your land shall not yield its produce ; and the trees of the land shall not yield their fruit .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	21	And if ye walk contrary unto me , and will not hearken unto me , I will bring sevenfold more plagues upon you according to your sins .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	22	And I will send the beasts of the field among you , that they may rob you of your children , and cut off your cattle , and make you few in number ; and your streets shall be desolate .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	23	And if ye will not be disciplined by me through these , but walk contrary unto me ,
DARBY	Leviticus	26	24	then will I also walk contrary unto you , and will smite you , even I , sevenfold for your sins .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	25	And I will bring a sword upon you that avengeth with the vengeance of the covenant , and ye shall be gathered together into your cities , and I will send the pestilence among you ; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	27	And if for this ye hearken not to me , but walk contrary unto me ,
DARBY	Leviticus	26	28	then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury ; and I , even I , will chastise you seven-fold for your sins .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	29	And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons , and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	30	And I will lay waste your high places , and cut down your sun-pillars , and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols ; and my soul shall abhor you .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	31	And I will lay waste your cities and desolate your sanctuaries ; and I will not smell your sweet odours .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	32	And I will bring the land into desolation ; that your enemies who dwell there in may be astonished at it .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	33	And I will scatter you among the nations , and will draw out the sword after you ; and your land shall be desolation , and your cities waste .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	34	Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths all the days of the desolation , when ye are in your enemies ' land ; then shall the land rest , and enjoy its sabbaths .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	35	All the days of the desolation it shall rest , [ the days in ] which it did not rest on your sabbaths , when ye dwelt therein .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	36	And as to those that remain of you—I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies , that the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them , and they shall flee , as fleeing from a sword ; and they shall fall when none pursueth ;
DARBY	Leviticus	26	37	and they shall stumble one over another , as it were before a sword , when none pursueth ; and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	38	And ye shall perish among the nations , and the land of your enemies shall eat you up .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	39	And they that remain of you shall waste away through their iniquity in your enemies ' lands ; and also through the iniquities of their fathers shall they waste away with them .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	40	And they shall confess their iniquity , and the iniquity of their fathers , through their unfaithfulness wherein they were unfaithful to me , and also that they have walked contrary unto me ,
DARBY	Leviticus	26	41	so that I also walked contrary unto them , and brought them into the land of their enemies . If then their uncircumcised heart be humbled , and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity ,
DARBY	Leviticus	26	42	I will remember my covenant with Jacob , and also my covenant with Isaac , and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember ; and I will remember the land .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	43	For the land shall be left by them , and shall enjoy its sabbaths , when it is in desolation without them ; and they shall accept the punishment of their iniquity ; because , even because they despised my judgments , and their soul abhorred my statutes .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	44	And yet for all that , when they are in the land of their enemies , I will not despise them , and will not abhor them , to make an end of them utterly , to break my covenant with them , for I am Jehovah their God .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	45	But I will remember toward them the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations , that I might be their God : I am Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	26	46	These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai , by the hand of Moses .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	27	But if it be of an unclean beast , then he shall ransom it according to thy valuation , and shall add a fifth of it thereto ; and if it be not redeemed , it shall be sold according to thy valuation .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	2	Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them , When any one devoteth [ anything ] by a vow , the persons shall be for Jehovah according to thy valuation .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	3	And thy valuation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old : thy valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver , after the shekel of the sanctuary ;
DARBY	Leviticus	27	4	and if it be of a female , thy valuation shall be thirty shekels .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	5	And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old , thy valuation of the male shall be twenty shekels , and for the female ten shekels .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	6	And if it be from a month old even unto five years old , thy valuation of the male shall be five shekels of silver ; and for the female thy valuation shall be three shekels of silver .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	7	And if it be from sixty years old and above , if it be a male , thy valuation shall be fifteen shekels ; and for the female ten shekels .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	8	And if he be poorer than thy valuation , he shall present himself before the priest , and the priest shall value him : according to his means that vowed shall the priest value him .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	9	And if it be a beast whereof men bring an offering unto Jehovah , all that they give of such unto Jehovah shall be holy .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	10	They shall not alter it nor change it , a good for a bad , or a bad for a good ; and if he at all change beast for beast , then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	11	And if it be any unclean beast , of which they do not bring an offering unto Jehovah , then he shall present the beast before the priest ;
DARBY	Leviticus	27	12	and the priest shall value it , [ judging ] between good and bad : according to the valuation of the priest , so shall it be .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	13	And if they will in any wise redeem it , then they shall add a fifth [ part ] thereof unto thy valuation .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	14	And when any one halloweth his house , that it may be holy to Jehovah , the priest shall value it , [ judging ] between good and bad : as the priest shall value it , so shall it stand .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	15	And if he that halloweth it will redeem his house , he shall add the fifth of the money of thy valuation unto it , and it shall be his .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	16	And if a man hallow to Jehovah [ part ] of a field of his possession , thy valuation shall be according to what may be sown in it : the homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	17	If he hallow his field from the year of jubilee , according to thy valuation shall it stand ;
DARBY	Leviticus	27	18	but if he hallow his field after the jubilee , then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain , until the year of the jubilee ; and there shall be a reduction from thy valuation .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	19	And if he that hallowed the field will in any wise redeem it , he shall add the fifth of the money of thy valuation unto it , and it shall be assured to him ;
DARBY	Leviticus	27	20	but if he do not redeem the field , or if he sell the field to another man , it can not be redeemed any more ;
DARBY	Leviticus	27	21	and the field , when it goeth out in the jubilee , shall be holy to Jehovah , as a field devoted ; the possession thereof shall be the priest 's .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	22	And if he hallow to Jehovah a field that he hath bought , which is not of the fields of his possession ,
DARBY	Leviticus	27	23	the priest shall reckon unto him the amount of thy valuation , unto the year of the jubilee ; and he shall give thy valuation on that day , [ as ] holy to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	24	In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought—to him to whom the land belonged .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	25	And all thy valuation shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary : twenty gerahs shall be the shekel .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	26	Only the firstling which is offered as firstling to Jehovah among the cattle , that shall no man hallow , whether it be ox or sheep ; it is Jehovah 's .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	28	Notwithstanding , no devoted thing that a man hath devoted to Jehovah of all that he hath , of man or beast , or of the field of his possession , shall be sold or redeemed : every devoted thing is most holy to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	29	Nothing devoted , which shall be devoted from among men , shall be ransomed : it shall certainly be put to death .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	30	And as to every tithe of the land , of the seed of the land , and of the fruit of the tree , it is Jehovah 's : it is holy to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	31	And if any one will at all redeem of his tithes , he shall add thereto the fifth thereof .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	32	And as to every tithe of the herd , or of the flock , of whatever passeth under the rod , the tenth shall be holy to Jehovah .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	33	He shall not search whether it be good or bad , neither shall he change it ; and if he change it at all , then both it and the exchange thereof shall be holy ; it shall not be redeemed .
DARBY	Leviticus	27	34	These are the commandments which Jehovah commanded Moses for the children of Israel upon mount Sinai .
DARBY	Numbers	1	1	And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai in the tent of meeting , on the first of the second month , in the second year after their departure from the land of Egypt , saying ,

DARBY	Numbers	1	18	and gathered the whole assembly together on the first of the second month . And they declared their pedigrees after their families , according to their fathers ' houses , by the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , according to their polls .

DARBY	Numbers	1	50	But thou , appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony , and over all the vessels thereof , and over all things that belong to it : they shall bear the tabernacle , and all its vessels ; and they shall serve it , and round about the tabernacle shall they encamp ;

DARBY	Numbers	2	32	These are those that were numbered of the children of Israel , according to their fathers ' houses : all those that were numbered of the camps , according to their hosts , were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty .
DARBY	Numbers	2	33	But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel ; as Jehovah had commanded Moses .
DARBY	Numbers	2	34	And the children of Israel did according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses : so they encamped according to their standards , and so they journeyed , every one according to their families , according to their fathers ' houses .
DARBY	Numbers	3	3	These are the names of the sons of Aaron , the anointed priests , who were consecrated to exercise the priesthood .
DARBY	Numbers	3	2	And these are the names of the sons of Aaron : Nadab the firstborn , and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar .

DARBY	Numbers	3	10	And Aaron and his sons shalt thou appoint that they may attend to their priest 's office ; and the stranger that cometh near shall be put to death .
DARBY	Numbers	3	11	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	3	12	And I , behold , I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of every firstborn that breaketh open the womb among the children of Israel , and the Levites shall be mine ;
DARBY	Numbers	3	13	for every firstborn is mine . On the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt , I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel , both of man and beast ; mine shall they be : I am Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	3	14	And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	3	15	Number the sons of Levi according to their fathers ' houses , after their families ; every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them .

DARBY	Numbers	5	3	both male and female shall ye put out ; outside the camp shall ye put them , that they defile not their camps , in the midst whereof I dwell .
DARBY	Numbers	5	4	And the children of Israel did so , and put them outside the camp : as Jehovah had said to Moses , so did the children of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	5	6	Speak unto the children of Israel , When a man or woman shall commit any of all the sins of man to work unfaithfulness against Jehovah , and that soul is guilty ,
DARBY	Numbers	5	7	then they shall confess their sin which they have done ; and he shall recompense his trespass according to the principal thereof , and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof , and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed .
DARBY	Numbers	5	8	And if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto , the trespass which is recompensed to Jehovah shall be the priest 's , besides the ram of the atonement , wherewith an atonement is made for him .
DARBY	Numbers	5	9	And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel , which they present unto the priest , shall be his .
DARBY	Numbers	5	10	And every man 's hallowed things shall be his : whatever any man giveth the priest shall be his .
DARBY	Numbers	5	11	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	5	12	Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , If any man 's wife go astray , and commit unfaithfulness against him ,
DARBY	Numbers	5	13	and a man lie with her carnally , and it be hid from the eyes of her husband , and she be defiled in secret , and there be no witness against her , and she have not been caught ;
DARBY	Numbers	5	14	and the spirit of jealousy come upon him , and he be jealous of his wife , and she have been defiled , —or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him , and he be jealous of his wife , and she have not been defiled ,
DARBY	Numbers	5	15	—then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest , and he shall bring her offering for her , a tenth part of an ephah of barley-meal ; he shall pour no oil upon it , nor put frankincense thereon ; for it is an oblation of jealousy , a memorial oblation , bringing iniquity to remembrance .
DARBY	Numbers	5	16	And the priest shall bring her near , and set her before Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	5	17	And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel ; and the priest shall take of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle , and put it into the water .
DARBY	Numbers	5	18	And the priest shall set the woman before Jehovah , and uncover the woman 's head , and put the memorial oblation in her hands , which is the jealousy offering ; and in the hand of the priest shall be the bitter water that bringeth the curse .
DARBY	Numbers	5	19	And the priest shall adjure her , and say unto the woman , If no man have lain with thee , and if thou hast not gone astray in uncleanness , in being with another instead of thy husband , be free from this bitter water that bringeth the curse .
DARBY	Numbers	5	20	But if thou hast gone astray to another instead of thy husband , and hast been defiled , and a man other than thy husband have lain with thee ,
DARBY	Numbers	5	21	—then the priest shall adjure the woman with the oath of cursing , and the priest shall say unto the woman : Jehovah make thee a curse and an oath among thy people , when Jehovah doth make thy thigh to shrink , and thy belly to swell ;
DARBY	Numbers	5	22	and this water that bringeth the curse shall enter into thy bowels , to make the belly to swell , and the thigh to shrink . And the woman shall say , Amen , amen .
DARBY	Numbers	5	23	And the priest shall write these curses in a book , and shall blot them out with the bitter water ,
DARBY	Numbers	5	24	and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that bringeth the curse , that the water that bringeth the curse may enter into her for bitterness .
DARBY	Numbers	5	25	And the priest shall take out of the woman 's hand the oblation of jealousy , and shall wave the oblation before Jehovah , and shall present it at the altar .
DARBY	Numbers	5	26	And the priest shall take a handful of the oblation as a memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar ; and afterwards he shall make the woman drink the water .
DARBY	Numbers	5	27	And when he hath made her to drink the water , then it shall come to pass , if she have been defiled , and have committed unfaithfulness against her husband , that the water that bringeth the curse shall enter into her , for bitterness , and her belly shall swell , and her thigh shall shrink ; and the woman shall become a curse among her people .
DARBY	Numbers	5	28	But if the woman have not been defiled , and be clean , then she shall be clear , and shall conceive seed .
DARBY	Numbers	5	29	This is the law of jealousies , when a wife goeth astray to another instead of her husband and is defiled ,
DARBY	Numbers	5	30	or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon a man , and he is jealous as regards his wife ; then shall he set the woman before Jehovah , and the priest shall do to her according to all this law .
DARBY	Numbers	5	31	Then shall the man be free from iniquity , but that woman shall bear her iniquity .
DARBY	Numbers	6	6	All the days that he hath consecrated himself to Jehovah , he shall come near no dead body .
DARBY	Numbers	6	2	Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , If a man or a woman have vowed the special vow of a Nazarite , to consecrate themselves to Jehovah ;
DARBY	Numbers	6	3	he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink : he shall drink no vinegar of wine , nor vinegar of strong drink , neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes , nor eat grapes , fresh or dried .
DARBY	Numbers	6	4	All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine , from the seed-stones , even to the skin .
DARBY	Numbers	6	5	All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head ; until the days be fulfilled , that he hath consecrated himself to Jehovah , he shall be holy ; he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow .
DARBY	Numbers	6	7	He shall not make himself unclean for his father , or for his mother , for his brother , or for his sister when they die ; for the consecration of his God is upon his head .
DARBY	Numbers	6	8	All the days of his separation he is holy to Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	6	9	And if any one die unexpectedly by him suddenly , and he hath defiled the head of his consecration , then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing ; on the seventh day shall he shave it .
DARBY	Numbers	6	10	And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtle-doves , or two young pigeons , to the priest , at the entrance of the tent of meeting .
DARBY	Numbers	6	11	And the priest shall offer one for a sin-offering , and the other for a burnt-offering , and make an atonement for him , for that he sinned by the dead person ; and he shall hallow his head that same day .
DARBY	Numbers	6	12	And he shall [ again ] consecrate to Jehovah the days of his separation , and shall bring a yearling lamb for a trespass-offering . But the first days are forfeited , for his consecration hath been defiled .
DARBY	Numbers	6	13	And this is the law of the Nazarite on the day when the days of his consecration are fulfilled : he shall be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting .
DARBY	Numbers	6	14	And he shall present his offering to Jehovah , one yearling he-lamb without blemish for a burnt-offering , and one yearling ewe-lamb without blemish for a sin-offering , and one ram without blemish for a peace-offering ;
DARBY	Numbers	6	15	and a basket with unleavened bread , cakes of fine flour mingled with oil , and unleavened wafers anointed with oil , and their oblation , and their drink-offerings .
DARBY	Numbers	6	16	And the priest shall present them before Jehovah , and shall offer his sin-offering and his burnt-offering :
DARBY	Numbers	6	17	and he shall offer the ram , a sacrifice of peace-offering to Jehovah , with the basket of unleavened bread ; the priest shall offer also his oblation and his drink-offering .
DARBY	Numbers	6	18	And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his consecration at the entrance to the tent of meeting , and shall take the hair of the head of his consecration , and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace-offering .
DARBY	Numbers	6	19	And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram , and one unleavened cake out of the basket , and one unleavened wafer , and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite , after he hath shaven [ the hair of ] his consecration .
DARBY	Numbers	6	20	And the priest shall wave them as wave-offering before Jehovah ; it is holy for the priest , with the breast of the wave-offering and with the shoulder of the heave-offering ; and afterwards the Nazarite may drink wine .
DARBY	Numbers	6	21	This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed : his offering to Jehovah for his consecration , beside what his hand is able to get ; according to the vow which he vowed , so shall he do , according to the law of his consecration .
DARBY	Numbers	6	22	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	6	23	Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons , saying , On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel : saying unto them ,
DARBY	Numbers	6	24	Jehovah bless thee , and keep thee ;
DARBY	Numbers	6	25	Jehovah make his face shine upon thee , and be gracious unto thee ;
DARBY	Numbers	6	26	Jehovah lift up his countenance upon thee , and give thee peace .
DARBY	Numbers	6	27	And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel ; and I will bless them .

DARBY	Numbers	7	2	that the princes of Israel , the heads of their fathers ' houses , the princes of the tribes , they that were over them that had been numbered , offered ;

DARBY	Numbers	7	5	Take it of them , and they shall be for the performance of the service of the tent of meeting , and thou shalt give them unto the Levites , to each according to his service .
DARBY	Numbers	7	6	And Moses took the waggons and the oxen , and gave them to the Levites .

DARBY	Numbers	8	8	And they shall take a young bullock and its oblation of fine flour mingled with oil ; and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin-offering .
DARBY	Numbers	8	2	Speak unto Aaron , and say unto him , When thou lightest the lamps , the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick .
DARBY	Numbers	8	3	And Aaron did so ; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick , as Jehovah had commanded Moses .
DARBY	Numbers	8	4	And this was the work of the candlestick : [ it was ] of beaten gold ; from its base to its flowers was it beaten work ; according to the form which Jehovah had shewn Moses , so had he made the candlestick .
DARBY	Numbers	8	5	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	8	6	Take the Levites from among the children of Israel , and cleanse them .
DARBY	Numbers	8	7	And thus shalt thou do unto them , to cleanse them : sprinkle upon them water of purification from sin ; and they shall pass the razor over all their flesh , and shall wash their garments , and make themselves clean .
DARBY	Numbers	8	9	And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tent of meeting ; and thou shalt gather together the whole assembly of the children of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	8	10	And thou shalt bring the Levites before Jehovah ; and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites .
DARBY	Numbers	8	11	And Aaron shall offer the Levites as a wave-offering before Jehovah from the children of Israel , and they shall perform the service of Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	8	12	And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks , and thou shalt offer the one for a sin-offering , and the other for a burnt-offering , to Jehovah , to make atonement for the Levites .
DARBY	Numbers	8	13	And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron , and before his sons , and offer them as a wave-offering to Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	8	14	And thou shalt separate the Levites from among the children of Israel , that the Levites may be mine .
DARBY	Numbers	8	15	And afterwards shall the Levites come in to do the service of the tent of meeting . And thou shalt cleanse them , and offer them as a wave-offering .
DARBY	Numbers	8	16	For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel ; instead of every one that breaketh open the womb , instead of every firstborn among the children of Israel , have I taken them unto me .
DARBY	Numbers	8	17	For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine , both of man and beast ; on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt , I hallowed them to myself .
DARBY	Numbers	8	18	And I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	8	19	And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons , from among the children of Israel , to perform the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting , and to make atonement for the children of Israel ; that there be no plague among the children of Israel , when the children of Israel draw near to the sanctuary .
DARBY	Numbers	8	20	And Moses and Aaron , and all the assembly of the children of Israel , did to the Levites according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites : so did the children of Israel to them .
DARBY	Numbers	8	21	And the Levites purified themselves from sin , and they washed their garments ; and Aaron offered them as a wave-offering before Jehovah ; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them .
DARBY	Numbers	8	22	And afterwards the Levites came in to perform their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron , and before his sons ; as Jehovah had commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so did they to them .
DARBY	Numbers	8	23	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	8	24	This is that which concerneth the Levites : from twenty-five years old and upward shall he come to labour in the work of the service of the tent of meeting .
DARBY	Numbers	8	25	And from fifty years old he shall retire from the labour of the service , and shall serve no more ;
DARBY	Numbers	8	26	but he shall minister with his brethren in the tent of meeting , and keep the charge , but he shall not serve [ in ] the service . Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites with regard to their charges .
DARBY	Numbers	9	9	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	9	2	Let the children of Israel also hold the passover at its set time ;
DARBY	Numbers	9	3	on the fourteenth day in this month between the two evenings , ye shall hold it at its set time ; according to all the rites of it , and according to all the ordinances thereof shall ye hold it .
DARBY	Numbers	9	4	And Moses spoke to the children of Israel , that they should hold the passover .
DARBY	Numbers	9	5	And they held the passover in the first [ month ] on the fourteenth day of the month , between the two evenings , in the wilderness of Sinai : according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses , so did the children of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	9	6	And there were men , who were unclean through the dead body of a man , and could not hold the passover on that day ; and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day .
DARBY	Numbers	9	7	And those men said to him , We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man : why are we kept back , that we may not present the offering of Jehovah at its set time among the children of Israel ?
DARBY	Numbers	9	8	And Moses said to them , Stay , and I will hear what Jehovah commands concerning you .
DARBY	Numbers	9	10	Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If any one of you or of your generations be unclean by reason of a dead body or be on a journey afar off , yet he shall hold the passover to Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	9	11	In the second month , on the fourteenth day , between the two evenings , shall they hold it ; with unleavened bread and bitter herbs shall they eat it .
DARBY	Numbers	9	12	They shall leave none of it until the morning , nor break a bone thereof : according to every ordinance of the passover shall they hold it .
DARBY	Numbers	9	13	But a man that is clean , and is not on a journey , and forbeareth to hold the passover , that soul shall be cut off from among his peoples ; because he presented not the offering of Jehovah at its set time : that man shall bear his sin .
DARBY	Numbers	9	14	And if a stranger shall sojourn among you , and would hold the passover to Jehovah , according to the rite of the passover , and according to the ordinance thereof , so shall he do . Ye shall have one rite , both for the stranger and for him that is born in the land .
DARBY	Numbers	9	15	And on the day that the tabernacle was set up , the cloud covered the tabernacle of the tent of testimony ; and at even it was upon the tabernacle as the appearance of fire , until the morning .
DARBY	Numbers	9	16	So it was continually : the cloud covered it , and at night it was as the appearance of fire .
DARBY	Numbers	9	17	And when the cloud rose from the tent , then the children of Israel journeyed ; and at the place where the cloud stood still , there the children of Israel encamped .
DARBY	Numbers	9	18	According to the commandment of Jehovah the children of Israel journeyed , and according to the commandment of Jehovah they [ remained ] encamped ; all the days that the cloud dwelt upon the tabernacle they encamped .
DARBY	Numbers	9	19	And when the cloud was long upon the tabernacle many days , then the children of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah , and journeyed not .
DARBY	Numbers	9	20	And if it were so that the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle , according to the commandment of Jehovah they encamped , and according to the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed .
DARBY	Numbers	9	21	And if it were so that the cloud was there from the evening until the morning , and that the cloud was taken up in the morning , then they journeyed ; or a day and a night , and the cloud was taken up , they journeyed ;
DARBY	Numbers	9	22	or two days , or a month , or many days , when the cloud was long upon the tabernacle , dwelling upon it , the children of Israel [ remained ] encamped , and journeyed not ; but when it was taken up , they journeyed .
DARBY	Numbers	9	23	At the commandment of Jehovah they encamped , and at the commandment of Jehovah they journeyed : they kept the charge of Jehovah according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses .
DARBY	Numbers	10	10	And in the day of your gladness , and in your set feasts , and in your new moons , ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings and over your sacrifices of peace-offering ; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God : I am Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Numbers	10	2	Make thee two trumpets of silver ; of beaten work shalt thou make them ; and they shall serve for the calling together of the assembly , and for the journeying of the camps .
DARBY	Numbers	10	3	And when they shall blow with them , the whole assembly shall gather to thee at the entrance of the tent of meeting .
DARBY	Numbers	10	4	And if they blow with one , then the princes , the heads of the thousands of Israel , shall gather unto thee .
DARBY	Numbers	10	5	And when ye blow an alarm , the camps that lie eastward shall set forward .
DARBY	Numbers	10	6	And when ye blow an alarm the second time , the camps that lie southward shall set forward ; they shall blow an alarm on their setting forward .
DARBY	Numbers	10	7	And when the congregation is to be gathered together , ye shall blow , but ye shall not blow an alarm :
DARBY	Numbers	10	8	the sons of Aaron , the priests , shall blow with the trumpets ; and they shall be to you for an everlasting statute throughout your generations .
DARBY	Numbers	10	9	And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you , then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets ; and ye shall be remembered before Jehovah your God , and ye shall be saved from your enemies .
DARBY	Numbers	10	11	And it came to pass in the second year , in the second month , on the twentieth of the month , that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony .
DARBY	Numbers	10	12	And the children of Israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud stood still in the wilderness of Paran .
DARBY	Numbers	10	13	And they first took their journey , according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses .
DARBY	Numbers	10	14	The standard of the camp of the children of Judah set forward first according to their hosts , and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab ;
DARBY	Numbers	10	15	and over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar ;
DARBY	Numbers	10	16	and over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon .

DARBY	Numbers	10	20	and over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel .
DARBY	Numbers	10	21	And the Kohathites set forward bearing the sanctuary : and [ the others ] set up the tabernacle whilst they came .
DARBY	Numbers	10	22	And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their hosts , and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud ;
DARBY	Numbers	10	23	and over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur ;
DARBY	Numbers	10	24	and over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni .
DARBY	Numbers	10	25	And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward , the rear-guard of all the camps according to their hosts , and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai ;
DARBY	Numbers	10	26	and over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran ;
DARBY	Numbers	10	27	and over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan .
DARBY	Numbers	10	28	These were the settings forward of the children of Israel according to their hosts : so did they set forward .
DARBY	Numbers	10	29	And Moses said to Hobab , the son of Reuel the Midianite , Moses ' father-in-law , We are journeying to the place of which Jehovah said , I will give it unto you : come with us , and we will do thee good ; for Jehovah has spoken good concerning Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	10	30	And he said to him , I will not go ; but to mine own land , and to my kindred will I go .
DARBY	Numbers	10	31	And he said , Leave me not , I pray thee , because thou knowest where we are to encamp in the wilderness , and thou wilt be to us for eyes .
DARBY	Numbers	10	32	And it shall be , if thou come with us , that whatever good Jehovah doeth unto us , so will we do to thee .
DARBY	Numbers	10	33	And they set forward from the mountain of Jehovah [ and went ] three days ' journey ; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went before them in the three days ' journey , to search out a resting-place for them .
DARBY	Numbers	10	34	And the cloud of Jehovah was over them by day when they set forward out of the camp .
DARBY	Numbers	10	35	And it came to pass when the ark set forward , that Moses said , Rise up , Jehovah , and let thine enemies be scattered ; And let them that hate thee flee before thy face .
DARBY	Numbers	10	36	And when it rested , he said , Return , Jehovah , unto the myriads of the thousands of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	11	11	And Moses said to Jehovah , Why hast thou done evil to thy servant , and why have I not found favour in thine eyes , that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me ?
DARBY	Numbers	11	2	And the people cried to Moses ; and Moses prayed to Jehovah—and the fire abated .
DARBY	Numbers	11	3	And they called the name of that place Taberah ; because a fire of Jehovah burned among them .
DARBY	Numbers	11	4	And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted ; and the children of Israel also wept again and said , Who will give us flesh to eat ?
DARBY	Numbers	11	5	We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt for nothing ; the cucumbers , and the melons , and the leeks , and the onions , and the garlic ;
DARBY	Numbers	11	6	and now our soul is dried up : there is nothing at all but the manna before our eyes .
DARBY	Numbers	11	7	And the manna was as coriander seed , and its appearance as the appearance of bdellium .
DARBY	Numbers	11	8	The people went about , and gathered it , and ground it with hand-mills , or beat it in mortars , and boiled it in pots , and made cakes of it ; and the taste of it was as the taste of oil-cakes .
DARBY	Numbers	11	9	And when the dew fell upon the camp by night , the manna fell upon it .
DARBY	Numbers	11	10	And Moses heard the people weep throughout their families , every one at the entrance of his tent ; and the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly ; it was also evil in the eyes of Moses .
DARBY	Numbers	11	12	Have I conceived all this people , have I brought them forth , that thou sayest to me , Carry them in thy bosom , as the nursing-father beareth the suckling , unto the land which thou didst swear unto their fathers ?
DARBY	Numbers	11	13	Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people ? for they weep unto me , saying , Give us flesh that we may eat !
DARBY	Numbers	11	14	I am not able to bear all this people alone , for it is too heavy for me .
DARBY	Numbers	11	15	And if thou deal thus with me , slay me , I pray thee , if I have found favour in thine eyes , that I may not behold my wretchedness .
DARBY	Numbers	11	16	And Jehovah said to Moses , Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel , whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people , and their officers ; and take them to the tent of meeting , and they shall stand there with thee .
DARBY	Numbers	11	17	And I will come down and talk with thee there ; and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee , and will put it upon them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee , and thou shalt not bear it alone .
DARBY	Numbers	11	18	And unto the people shalt thou say , Hallow yourselves for to-morrow , and ye shall eat flesh ; for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah , saying , Who will give us flesh to eat ? for it was well with us in Egypt ; and Jehovah will give you flesh , and ye shall eat .
DARBY	Numbers	11	19	Not one day shall ye eat , nor two days , nor five days , neither ten days , nor twenty days ;
DARBY	Numbers	11	20	[ but ] for a whole month , until it come out at your nostrils , and it become loathsome unto you ; because that ye have despised Jehovah who is among you , and have wept before him , saying , Why came we forth out of Egypt ?
DARBY	Numbers	11	21	And Moses said , The people in whose midst I am are six hundred thousand footmen ; and thou sayest , I will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month .
DARBY	Numbers	11	22	Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them , to suffice them ? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered for them , to suffice them ?
DARBY	Numbers	11	23	And Jehovah said to Moses , Hath Jehovah 's hand become short ? Now shalt thou see whether my word will come to pass unto thee or not .
DARBY	Numbers	11	24	And Moses went out and told the people the words of Jehovah ; and he gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people , and set them round about the tent .
DARBY	Numbers	11	25	And Jehovah came down in a cloud , and spoke to him , and took of the Spirit that was upon him , and put it upon the seventy men , the elders ; and it came to pass , that when the Spirit rested on them , they prophesied , but they did not repeat [ it ] .
DARBY	Numbers	11	26	And two men remained in the camp , the name of the one , Eldad , and the name of the other , Medad ; and the Spirit rested upon them ( and they were among them that were written , but they had not gone out to the tent ) ; and they prophesied in the camp .
DARBY	Numbers	11	27	And there ran a youth , and told Moses , and said , Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp .
DARBY	Numbers	11	28	And Joshua the son of Nun , the attendant of Moses , one of his young men , answered and said , My lord Moses , forbid them !
DARBY	Numbers	11	29	But Moses said to him , Enviest thou for my sake ? would that all Jehovah 's people were prophets , [ and ] that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them !
DARBY	Numbers	11	30	And Moses withdrew into the camp , he and the elders of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	11	31	And there went forth a wind from Jehovah , and drove quails from the sea , and cast them about the camp , about a day 's journey on this side , and about a day 's journey on the other side , round about the camp , and about two cubits above the earth .
DARBY	Numbers	11	32	And the people rose up all that day , and the whole night , and all the next day , and they gathered the quails : he that gathered little gathered ten homers ; and they spread them abroad for themselves round about the camp .
DARBY	Numbers	11	33	The flesh was yet between their teeth , before it was chewed , when the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against the people , and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague .
DARBY	Numbers	11	34	And they called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah ; because there they buried the people who lusted .
DARBY	Numbers	11	35	From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth ; and they were at Hazeroth .
DARBY	Numbers	12	12	Let her not be as one stillborn , half of whose flesh is consumed when he comes out of his mother 's womb .
DARBY	Numbers	12	2	And they said , Has Jehovah indeed spoken only to Moses ? has he not spoken also to us ? And Jehovah heard it .
DARBY	Numbers	12	3	But the man Moses was very meek , above all men that were upon the face of the earth .
DARBY	Numbers	12	4	Then Jehovah spoke suddenly to Moses , and to Aaron , and to Miriam , Come out ye three unto the tent of meeting . And they went out , they three .
DARBY	Numbers	12	5	And Jehovah came down in the pillar of the cloud , and stood at the entrance of the tent , and called Aaron and Miriam ; and they both came forth .
DARBY	Numbers	12	6	And he said , Hear now my words : If there be a prophet among you , I Jehovah will make myself known to him in a vision , I will speak to him in a dream .
DARBY	Numbers	12	7	Not so my servant Moses : he is faithful in all my house .
DARBY	Numbers	12	8	Mouth to mouth do I speak to him openly , and not in riddles ; and the form of Jehovah doth he behold . Why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant , against Moses ?
DARBY	Numbers	12	9	And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against them , and he went away ;
DARBY	Numbers	12	10	and the cloud departed from off the tent . And behold , Miriam was leprous as snow ; and Aaron turned toward Miriam , and behold , she was leprous .
DARBY	Numbers	12	11	Then Aaron said to Moses , Alas , my lord , I beseech thee , lay not this sin upon us , wherein we have been foolish , and have sinned !
DARBY	Numbers	12	13	And Moses cried to Jehovah , saying , O God , heal her , I beseech thee !
DARBY	Numbers	12	14	And Jehovah said to Moses , But had her father anyways spat in her face , should she not be shamed seven days ? She shall be shut outside the camp seven days , and afterwards she shall be received in [ again ] .
DARBY	Numbers	12	15	And Miriam was shut outside the camp seven days ; and the people did not journey till Miriam was received in [ again ] .
DARBY	Numbers	12	16	And afterwards the people journeyed from Hazeroth , and encamped in the wilderness of Paran .
DARBY	Numbers	13	13	for the tribe of Asher , Sethur the son of Michael ;
DARBY	Numbers	13	2	Send thou men , that they may search out the land of Canaan , which I give unto the children of Israel . Ye shall send a man of every tribe of his fathers , each a prince among them .
DARBY	Numbers	13	3	And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran : according to the commandment of Jehovah , all of them heads of the children of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	13	4	And these are their names : for the tribe of Reuben , Shammua the son of Zaccur ;
DARBY	Numbers	13	5	for the tribe of Simeon , Shaphat the son of Hori ;

DARBY	Numbers	13	16	These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to search out the land . And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun , Jehoshua .
DARBY	Numbers	13	17	And Moses sent them to search out the land of Canaan , and said to them , Go up this way by the south and go up into the hill-country ,
DARBY	Numbers	13	18	and ye shall see the land , what it is ; and the people that dwell in it , whether they are strong or weak , few or many ;
DARBY	Numbers	13	19	and what the land is that they dwell in , whether it is good or bad ; and what cities they are that they dwell in , whether in camps , or in strongholds ;
DARBY	Numbers	13	20	and what the land is , whether it is fat or lean , whether there are trees in it , or not . And take courage , and bring of the fruit of the land . Now the time was the time of the first grapes .
DARBY	Numbers	13	21	And they went up , and searched out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob , where one comes towards Hamath .
DARBY	Numbers	13	22	And they went up by the south , and came to Hebron ; and Ahiman , Sheshai , and Talmai , the children of Anak , were there . Now Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt .
DARBY	Numbers	13	23	And they came as far as the valley of Eshcol , and cut down thence a branch with one bunch of grapes , and they bore it between two upon a pole ; and [ they brought ] of the pomegranates , and of the figs .
DARBY	Numbers	13	24	That place was called the valley of Eshcol , because of the grapes which the children of Israel had cut down there .
DARBY	Numbers	13	25	And they returned from searching out the land after forty days .
DARBY	Numbers	13	26	And they came , and went to Moses and to Aaron , and to the whole assembly of the children of Israel , to the wilderness of Paran , to Kadesh ; and brought back word to them , and to the whole assembly ; and shewed them the fruit of the land .
DARBY	Numbers	13	27	And they told him , and said , We came to the land to which thou didst send us , and surely it floweth with milk and honey ; and this is the fruit of it .
DARBY	Numbers	13	28	Only , the people are strong that dwell in the land , and the cities are walled , very great ; moreover we saw the children of Anak there .
DARBY	Numbers	13	29	Amalek dwells in the land of the south ; and the Hittites , and the Jebusites , and the Amorites dwell in the hill-country ; and the Canaanites dwell by the sea , and by the side of the Jordan .
DARBY	Numbers	13	30	And Caleb stilled the people before Moses , and said , Let us go up boldly and possess it , for we are well able to do it .
DARBY	Numbers	13	31	But the men that went up with him said , We are not able to go up against the people , for they are stronger than we .
DARBY	Numbers	13	32	And they brought to the children of Israel an evil report of the land which they had searched out , saying , The land , which we have passed through to search it out , is a land that eateth up its inhabitants ; and all the people that we have seen in it are men of great stature ;
DARBY	Numbers	13	33	and there have we seen giants—the sons of Anak are of the giants—and we were in our sight as grasshoppers , and so we were also in their sight .
DARBY	Numbers	14	14	and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land , [ who ] have heard that thou , Jehovah , art in the midst of this people , that thou , Jehovah , lettest thyself be seen eye to eye , and that thy cloud standeth over them , and that thou goest before them , in a pillar of cloud by day , and in a pillar of fire by night ;
DARBY	Numbers	14	2	And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron ; and the whole assembly said to them , Would that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or in this wilderness would that we had died !
DARBY	Numbers	14	3	And why is Jehovah bringing us to this land that we may fall by the sword , that our wives and our little ones may become a prey ? Is it not better for us to return to Egypt ?
DARBY	Numbers	14	4	And they said one to another , Let us make a captain , and let us return to Egypt .
DARBY	Numbers	14	5	Then Moses and Aaron fell upon their faces before the whole congregation of the assembly of the children of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	14	6	And Joshua the son of Nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , of them that searched out the land , rent their garments .
DARBY	Numbers	14	7	And they spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel , saying , The land , which we passed through to search it out , is a very , very good land .
DARBY	Numbers	14	8	If Jehovah delight in us , he will bring us into this land , and give it us , a land that flows with milk and honey ;
DARBY	Numbers	14	9	only rebel not against Jehovah ; and fear not the people of the land ; for they shall be our food . Their defence is departed from them , and Jehovah is with us : fear them not .
DARBY	Numbers	14	10	And the whole assembly said that they should be stoned with stones . And the glory of Jehovah appeared in the tent of meeting to all the children of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	14	11	And Jehovah said to Moses , How long will this people despise me ? and how long will they not believe me , for all the signs which I have done among them ?
DARBY	Numbers	14	12	I will smite them with the pestilence , and destroy them , and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they .
DARBY	Numbers	14	13	And Moses said to Jehovah , Then the Egyptians will hear it ; for in thy might thou broughtest up this people from the midst of them ;
DARBY	Numbers	14	15	if thou now slayest this people as one man , then the nations that have heard thy fame will speak , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	14	16	Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land that he had sworn unto them , he has therefore slain them in the wilderness .
DARBY	Numbers	14	17	And now , I beseech thee , let the power of the Lord be great , according as thou hast spoken , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	14	18	Jehovah is slow to anger , and abundant in goodness , forgiving iniquity and transgression , but by no means clearing [ the guilty ] , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children , upon the third and fourth [ generation ] .
DARBY	Numbers	14	19	Pardon , I beseech thee , the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy loving-kindness , and as thou hast forgiven this people , from Egypt even until now .
DARBY	Numbers	14	20	And Jehovah said , I have pardoned according to thy word .
DARBY	Numbers	14	21	But as surely as I live , all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Jehovah !
DARBY	Numbers	14	22	for all those men who have seen my glory , and my signs , which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness , and have tempted me these ten times , and have not hearkened to my voice ,
DARBY	Numbers	14	23	shall in no wise see the land which I did swear unto their fathers : none of them that despised me shall see it .
DARBY	Numbers	14	24	But my servant Caleb , because he hath another spirit in him , and hath followed me fully , him will I bring into the land whereinto he came ; and his seed shall possess it .
DARBY	Numbers	14	25	( Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valley . ) To-morrow turn you , and take your journey into the wilderness , on the way to the Red sea .
DARBY	Numbers	14	26	And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	14	27	How long [ shall I bear ] with this evil assembly , which murmur against me ? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel , which they murmur against me .
DARBY	Numbers	14	28	Say unto them , As surely as I live , saith Jehovah , if I do not do unto you as ye have spoken in mine ears !
DARBY	Numbers	14	29	In this wilderness shall your carcases fall ; and all that were numbered of you , according to your whole number from twenty years old and upwards , who have murmured against me ,
DARBY	Numbers	14	30	shall in no wise come into the land , concerning which I have lifted up my hand to make you dwell in it ; save Caleb the son of Jephunneh , and Joshua the son of Nun .
DARBY	Numbers	14	31	But your little ones , of whom ye said they should be a prey , them will I bring in , and they shall know the land that ye have despised .
DARBY	Numbers	14	32	And as to you , your carcases shall fall in this wilderness .
DARBY	Numbers	14	33	And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years , and bear your whoredoms , until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness .
DARBY	Numbers	14	34	After the number of the days in which ye have searched out the land , forty days , each day for a year shall ye bear your iniquities forty years , and ye shall know mine estrangement [ from you ] .
DARBY	Numbers	14	35	I Jehovah have spoken ; I will surely do it unto all this evil assembly which have gathered together against me ! in this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die .
DARBY	Numbers	14	36	And the men whom Moses had sent to search out the land , who returned , and made the whole assembly to murmur against him , by bringing up an evil report upon the land ,
DARBY	Numbers	14	37	even those men who had brought up an evil report upon the land , died by a plague before Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	14	38	But Joshua the son of Nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , lived still of the men that had gone to search out the land .
DARBY	Numbers	14	39	And Moses told all these sayings to all the children of Israel ; then the people mourned greatly .
DARBY	Numbers	14	40	And they rose up early in the morning , and went up to the hill-top , saying , Here are we , and we will go up to the place of which Jehovah has spoken ; for we have sinned .
DARBY	Numbers	14	41	And Moses said , Why now do ye transgress the commandment of Jehovah ? but it shall not prosper !
DARBY	Numbers	14	42	Go not up , for Jehovah is not among you ; that ye be not smitten before your enemies ;
DARBY	Numbers	14	43	for the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you , and ye shall fall by the sword ; for as ye have turned away from Jehovah , Jehovah will not be with you .
DARBY	Numbers	14	44	Yet they presumed to go up to the hill-top ; but the ark of the covenant of Jehovah , and Moses , did not depart from the midst of the camp .
DARBY	Numbers	14	45	And the Amalekites and the Canaanites who dwelt on that hill , came down and smote them , and cut them to pieces , as far as Hormah .
DARBY	Numbers	15	15	As to the congregation , there shall be one statute for you , and for the stranger that sojourneth with you , an everlasting statute throughout your generations : as ye are , so shall the stranger be , before Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	15	2	Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land of your dwellings , which I give unto you ,
DARBY	Numbers	15	3	and will make an offering by fire to Jehovah , a burnt-offering or a sacrifice for the performance of a vow , or as a voluntary offering , or in your set feasts , to make a sweet odour to Jehovah , of the herd or of the flock ,
DARBY	Numbers	15	4	then shall he that presenteth his offering to Jehovah bring as oblation a tenth part of fine flour mingled with a fourth part of a hin of oil ;
DARBY	Numbers	15	5	and of wine for a drink-offering shalt thou offer the fourth part of a hin with the burnt-offering , or with the sacrifice , for one lamb .
DARBY	Numbers	15	6	And for a ram thou shalt offer as oblation two tenth parts of fine flour mingled with oil , a third part of a hin ,
DARBY	Numbers	15	7	and of wine for a drink-offering shalt thou offer the third part of a hin ; for a sweet odour to Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	15	8	And when thou offerest a bullock for a burnt-offering , or a sacrifice for the performance of a vow , or for a peace-offering to Jehovah ,
DARBY	Numbers	15	9	then shall they present with the bullock as oblation three tenth parts of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil ;
DARBY	Numbers	15	10	and of wine shalt thou present half a hin , for a drink-offering , as an offering by fire , of a sweet odour to Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	15	11	Thus shall it be done for one ox , or for one ram , or for a lamb , or for a kid ;
DARBY	Numbers	15	12	according to the number that ye offer , so shall ye do to every one according to their number .
DARBY	Numbers	15	13	And all that are born in the land shall do these things thus , in presenting an offering by fire of a sweet odour to Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	15	14	And if a stranger sojourn with you , or whoever be among you throughout your generations , and will offer an offering by fire of a sweet odour to Jehovah , —as ye do , so shall he do .
DARBY	Numbers	15	16	One law and one ordinance shall be for you , and for the stranger that sojourneth with you .
DARBY	Numbers	15	17	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	15	18	Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land whither I bring you ,
DARBY	Numbers	15	19	then it shall be , when ye eat of the bread of the land , that ye shall offer a heave-offering to Jehovah ;
DARBY	Numbers	15	20	the first of your dough shall ye offer , a cake , for a heave-offering ; as the heave-offering of the threshing-floor , so shall ye offer this .
DARBY	Numbers	15	21	Of the first of your dough ye shall give to Jehovah a heave-offering throughout your generations .
DARBY	Numbers	15	22	And if ye sin inadvertently , and do not all these commandments , which Jehovah hath spoken unto Moses ,
DARBY	Numbers	15	23	all that Jehovah hath commanded you through Moses , from the day that Jehovah gave commandment , and henceforward throughout your generations ;
DARBY	Numbers	15	24	then it shall be , if ought be committed by inadvertence [ hid ] from the eyes of the assembly , that the whole assembly shall offer one young bullock for a burnt-offering , for a sweet odour to Jehovah , and its oblation and its drink-offering according to the ordinance , and one buck of the goats for a sin-offering .
DARBY	Numbers	15	25	And the priest shall make atonement for the whole assembly of the children of Israel , and it shall be forgiven them ; for it was a sin of inadvertence , and they have brought before Jehovah their offering , as an offering by fire to Jehovah , and their sin-offering for their [ sin of ] inadvertence ;
DARBY	Numbers	15	26	and it shall be forgiven the whole assembly of the children of Israel , and the stranger that sojourneth among them ; for with all the people there was [ a sin of ] inadvertence .
DARBY	Numbers	15	27	And if one soul sin through inadvertence , then he shall present a yearling she-goat for a sin-offering .
DARBY	Numbers	15	28	And the priest shall make atonement for the soul that hath done inadvertently , when he sinneth by inadvertence before Jehovah , to make atonement for him ; and it shall be forgiven him .
DARBY	Numbers	15	29	For him that is born in the land among the children of Israel , and for the stranger that sojourneth among them—there shall be one law for you , for him who doeth anything through inadvertence .
DARBY	Numbers	15	30	But the soul that doeth ought with a high hand , whether born in the land , or a stranger , he reproacheth Jehovah ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
DARBY	Numbers	15	31	For he hath despised the word of Jehovah , and hath broken his commandment : that soul shall surely be cut off ; his iniquity is upon him .
DARBY	Numbers	15	32	And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness they found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath day .
DARBY	Numbers	15	33	And they that found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron , and to the whole assembly .
DARBY	Numbers	15	34	And they put him in custody , for it was not declared what should be done to him .
DARBY	Numbers	15	35	And Jehovah said to Moses , The man shall certainly be put to death : the whole assembly shall stone him with stones outside the camp .
DARBY	Numbers	15	36	And the whole assembly led him outside the camp , and stoned him with stones , and he died , as Jehovah had commanded Moses .
DARBY	Numbers	15	37	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	15	38	Speak unto the children of Israel , and bid them that they make them tassels on the corners of their garments , throughout their generations , and that they attach to the tassel of the corners a lace of blue ;
DARBY	Numbers	15	39	and it shall be unto you for a tassel , that ye may look upon it , and remember all the commandments of Jehovah , and do them ; and that ye seek not after [ the lusts of ] your own heart and your own eyes , after which ye go a whoring ;
DARBY	Numbers	15	40	that ye may remember and do all my commandments , and be holy unto your God .
DARBY	Numbers	15	41	I am Jehovah your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God : I am Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Numbers	16	16	And Moses said to Korah , Be thou and all thy band before Jehovah , thou , and they , and Aaron , to-morrow .
DARBY	Numbers	16	2	and they rose up against Moses , with two hundred and fifty men of the children of Israel , princes of the assembly , summoned to the council , men of renown ;
DARBY	Numbers	16	3	and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron , and said to them , It is enough ; for all the assembly , all of them are holy , and Jehovah is among them ; and why do ye lift up yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah ?
DARBY	Numbers	16	4	When Moses heard this , he fell on his face .
DARBY	Numbers	16	5	And he spoke to Korah and to all his band , saying , Even to-morrow will Jehovah make known who is his , and who is holy ; and he will cause him to come near to him ; and him whom he has chosen , him will he cause to come near to him .
DARBY	Numbers	16	6	This do : take you censers , Korah , and all his band ,
DARBY	Numbers	16	7	and put fire therein , and lay incense thereon before Jehovah to-morrow ; and it shall be that the man whom Jehovah doth choose , he shall be holy . It is enough , ye sons of Levi !
DARBY	Numbers	16	8	And Moses said to Korah , Hear , I pray you , ye sons of Levi !
DARBY	Numbers	16	9	Is it too little for you , that the God of Israel has separated you from the assembly of Israel , to bring you near to himself to do the work of the tabernacle of Jehovah , and to stand before the assembly to minister to them ?
DARBY	Numbers	16	10	—that he has brought thee near , and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee ; and seek ye now the priesthood also ?
DARBY	Numbers	16	11	For which cause thou and all thy band are banded together against Jehovah ; and Aaron , who is he that ye murmur against him ?
DARBY	Numbers	16	12	And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab ; but they said , We will not come up !
DARBY	Numbers	16	13	Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , that thou must make thyself altogether a ruler over us ?
DARBY	Numbers	16	14	Moreover , thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey , or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards : wilt thou put out the eyes of these men ? we will not come up !
DARBY	Numbers	16	15	Then Moses was very wroth , and said to Jehovah , Have no regard to their oblation : not one ass have I taken from them , neither have I hurt one of them .
DARBY	Numbers	16	17	And take each his censer , and put incense thereon , and present before Jehovah every man his censer , two hundred and fifty censers ; and thou , and Aaron , each his censer .
DARBY	Numbers	16	18	And they took each his censer , and put fire on them , and laid incense thereon , and stood before the entrance to the tent of meeting , as well as Moses and Aaron .
DARBY	Numbers	16	19	And Korah gathered the whole assembly against them to the entrance of the tent of meeting . And the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the assembly .
DARBY	Numbers	16	20	And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	16	21	Separate yourselves from the midst of this assembly , and I will consume them in a moment .
DARBY	Numbers	16	22	And they fell on their faces , and said , O God , the God of the spirits of all flesh ! shall * one * man sin , and wilt thou be wroth with the whole assembly ?
DARBY	Numbers	16	23	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	16	24	Speak unto the assembly , saying , Get you up from about the habitation of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram .
DARBY	Numbers	16	25	And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram ; and the elders of Israel followed him .
DARBY	Numbers	16	26	And he spoke to the assembly , saying , Depart , I pray you , from the tents of these wicked men , and touch nothing of theirs , lest ye perish in all their sins .
DARBY	Numbers	16	27	And they got up from the habitation of Koran , Dathan , and Abiram , on every side . And Dathan and Abiram came out , and stood in the entrance of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little ones .
DARBY	Numbers	16	28	And Moses said , Hereby ye shall know that Jehovah has sent me to do all these deeds , for they are not out of my own heart :
DARBY	Numbers	16	29	if these men die as all men die , and are visited with the visitation of all men , Jehovah has not sent me ;
DARBY	Numbers	16	30	but if Jehovah make a new thing , and the ground open its mouth , and swallow them up , and all that they have , and they go down alive into Sheol , then ye shall know that these men have despised Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	16	31	And it came to pass when he had ended speaking all these words , that the ground clave apart that was under them .
DARBY	Numbers	16	32	And the earth opened its mouth , and swallowed them up , and their households , and all the men that belonged to Korah , and all their property .
DARBY	Numbers	16	33	And they went down , they and all that they had , alive into Sheol , and the earth covered them ; and they perished from among the congregation .
DARBY	Numbers	16	34	And all Israel that were round about them fled at their cry ; for they said , Lest the earth swallow us up !
DARBY	Numbers	16	35	And there came out a fire from Jehovah , and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that had presented incense .
DARBY	Numbers	16	36	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	16	37	Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest , that he take up the censers out of the burning ; and scatter the fire afar ; for they are hallowed ,
DARBY	Numbers	16	38	the censers of these sinners who have forfeited their life ; and they shall make them into broad plates for the covering of the altar ; for they presented them before Jehovah , therefore they are hallowed ; and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	16	39	And Eleazar the priest took the copper censers , which they that were burnt had presented ; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar :
DARBY	Numbers	16	40	as a memorial to the children of Israel , that no stranger who is not of the seed of Aaron come near to burn incense before Jehovah , that he be not as Korah , and as his band , —as Jehovah had said to him through Moses .
DARBY	Numbers	16	41	And the whole assembly of the children of Israel murmured on the morrow against Moses and against Aaron , saying , Ye have killed the people of Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	16	42	And it came to pass , when the assembly was gathered together against Moses and against Aaron , that they looked toward the tent of meeting , and behold , the cloud covered it , and the glory of Jehovah appeared .
DARBY	Numbers	16	43	And Moses and Aaron went before the tent of meeting .
DARBY	Numbers	16	44	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	16	45	Get you up from the midst of this assembly , and I will consume them in a moment . And they fell on their faces .
DARBY	Numbers	16	46	And Moses said to Aaron , Take the censer , and put fire thereon from off the altar , and lay on incense , and carry it quickly to the assembly , and make atonement for them ; for there is wrath gone out from Jehovah : the plague is begun .
DARBY	Numbers	16	47	And Aaron took as Moses had said , and ran into the midst of the congregation ; and behold , the plague had begun among the people ; and he put on incense , and made atonement for the people .
DARBY	Numbers	16	48	And he stood between the dead and the living ; and the plague was stayed .
DARBY	Numbers	16	49	Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred , besides them that had died because of the matter of Korah .
DARBY	Numbers	16	50	And Aaron returned to Moses to the entrance of the tent of meeting ; and the plague was stayed .
DARBY	Numbers	17	17	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	17	2	Speak unto the children of Israel , and take of them a staff , a staff for each father 's house , of all their princes according to the houses of their fathers , twelve staves : thou shalt write each one 's name upon his staff .
DARBY	Numbers	17	3	And Aaron 's name shalt thou write upon the staff of Levi ; for one staff shall be for [ each ] head of their fathers ' houses .
DARBY	Numbers	17	4	And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony , where I meet with you .
DARBY	Numbers	17	5	And it shall come to pass , that the man whom I shall choose , his staff shall bud forth ; and I will make to cease from before me the murmurings of the children of Israel , that they murmur against you .
DARBY	Numbers	17	6	And Moses spoke to the children of Israel , and all their princes gave him a staff , one staff for each prince according to their fathers ' houses , twelve staves , and the staff of Aaron was among their staves .
DARBY	Numbers	17	7	And Moses laid the staves before Jehovah in the tent of the testimony .
DARBY	Numbers	17	8	And it came to pass , when on the morrow Moses went into the tent of the testimony , behold , the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded , and brought forth buds , and bloomed blossoms , and ripened almonds .
DARBY	Numbers	17	9	And Moses brought out all the staves from before Jehovah to all the children of Israel , and they looked and took each one his staff .
DARBY	Numbers	17	10	And Jehovah said to Moses , Bring Aaron 's staff again before the testimony , to be kept as a token for the sons of rebellion , that thou mayest put an end to their murmurings before me , that they may not die .
DARBY	Numbers	17	11	And Moses did so : as Jehovah had commanded him , so did he .
DARBY	Numbers	17	12	And the children of Israel spoke to Moses , saying , Lo , we expire , we perish , we all perish .
DARBY	Numbers	17	13	Every one that comes at all near to the tabernacle of Jehovah shall die : shall we then expire altogether ?
DARBY	Numbers	18	18	And their flesh shall be thine ; as the wave-breast and as the right shoulder shall it be thine .
DARBY	Numbers	18	2	And thy brethren also , the tribe of Levi , the tribe of thy father , bring near with thee , that they may unite with thee , and minister unto thee ; but thou and thy sons with thee [ shall serve ] before the tent of the testimony .
DARBY	Numbers	18	3	And they shall keep thy charge , and the charge of the whole tent : only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar , that they may not die , and you as well as they .
DARBY	Numbers	18	4	And they shall unite with thee , and keep the charge of the tent of meeting , for all the service of the tent ; and no stranger shall come near to you .
DARBY	Numbers	18	5	And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary , and the charge of the altar ; that there come no wrath any more upon the children of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	18	6	And I , behold , I have taken your brethren , the Levites , from among the children of Israel ; to you are they given as a gift for Jehovah to perform the service of the tent of meeting .
DARBY	Numbers	18	7	But thou and thy sons with thee shall attend to your priesthood for all that concerneth the altar , and for that which is inside the veil ; and ye shall perform the service : I give you your priesthood as a service of gift , and the stranger that cometh near shall be put to death .
DARBY	Numbers	18	8	And Jehovah spoke to Aaron , And I , behold , I have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings , of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel ; to thee have I given them , because of the anointing , and to thy sons by an everlasting statute .
DARBY	Numbers	18	9	This shall be thine of the most holy things , [ reserved ] from the fire : every offering of theirs , of all their oblations , and of all their sin-offerings , and of all their trespass-offerings , which they render unto me , it is most holy for thee and for thy sons .
DARBY	Numbers	18	10	As most holy shalt thou eat it : every male shall eat it ; it shall be holy unto thee .
DARBY	Numbers	18	11	And this shall be thine : the heave-offering of their gift , with all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel ; I have given them unto thee , and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee , by an everlasting statute ; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it .
DARBY	Numbers	18	12	All the best of the oil , and all the best of the new wine , and of the wheat , the firstfruits of them which they give to Jehovah , have I given thee .
DARBY	Numbers	18	13	The first ripe of everything that is in their land , which they shall bring to Jehovah , shall be thine ; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it .
DARBY	Numbers	18	14	Every devoted thing in Israel shall be thine .
DARBY	Numbers	18	15	Everything that breaketh open the womb of all flesh , which they present to Jehovah , of men or of beasts , shall be thine ; nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou in any case ransom , and the firstborn of unclean beasts shalt thou ransom .
DARBY	Numbers	18	16	And those that are to be ransomed from a month old shalt thou ransom , according to thy valuation , for the money of five shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary , which is twenty gerahs .
DARBY	Numbers	18	17	But the firstborn of a cow , or the firstborn of a sheep , or the firstborn of a goat , thou shalt not ransom : they are holy . Thou shalt sprinkle their blood on the altar , and their fat shalt thou burn as an offering by fire for a sweet odour to Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	18	19	All the heave-offerings of the holy things , which the children of Israel offer to Jehovah , have I given thee , and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee , by an everlasting statute : it shall be an everlasting covenant of salt before Jehovah unto thee and thy seed with thee .
DARBY	Numbers	18	20	And Jehovah said to Aaron , In their land thou shalt have no inheritance , neither shalt thou have any portion among them : I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	18	21	And to the children of Levi , behold , I have given all the tithes in Israel for an inheritance , for their service which they perform , the service of the tent of meeting .
DARBY	Numbers	18	22	Neither shall the children of Israel henceforth come near the tent of meeting , to bear sin and die .
DARBY	Numbers	18	23	But the Levite , he shall perform the service of the tent of meeting , and they shall bear their iniquity : it is an everlasting statute throughout your generations . And among the children of Israel shall they possess no inheritance ;
DARBY	Numbers	18	24	for I have given for an inheritance to the Levites the tithes of the children of Israel , which they offer as a heave-offering to Jehovah ; therefore I have said of them , They shall possess no inheritance among the children of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	18	25	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	18	26	And to the Levites shalt thou speak , and say unto them , When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance , then ye shall offer a heave-offering from it for Jehovah , the tenth of the tithe .
DARBY	Numbers	18	27	And your heave-offering shall be reckoned unto you , as the corn from the threshing-floor , and as the fulness of the winepress .
DARBY	Numbers	18	28	Thus ye also shall offer Jehovah 's heave-offering of all your tithes , which ye take of the children of Israel ; and ye shall give thereof Jehovah 's heave-offering to Aaron the priest .
DARBY	Numbers	18	29	Out of all that is given you ye shall offer the whole heave-offering of Jehovah , —of all the best thereof the hallowed part thereof .
DARBY	Numbers	18	30	And thou shalt say unto them , When ye heave the best thereof from it , then it shall be counted unto the Levites as produce of the threshing-floor , and as produce of the winepress .
DARBY	Numbers	18	31	And ye shall eat it in every place , ye and your households ; for it is your reward for your service in the tent of meeting .
DARBY	Numbers	18	32	And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it , if ye heave from it the best of it ; and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel , lest ye die .
DARBY	Numbers	19	19	and the clean shall sprinkle it on the unclean on the third day , and on the seventh day ; and he shall purify him on the seventh day ; and he shall wash his garments , and bathe himself in water , and shall be clean at even .
DARBY	Numbers	19	2	This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded , saying , Speak unto the children of Israel , that they bring thee a red heifer without blemish , wherein is no defect , and upon which never came yoke ;
DARBY	Numbers	19	3	and ye shall give it to Eleazar the priest , and he shall bring it outside the camp , and one shall slaughter it before him .
DARBY	Numbers	19	4	And Eleazar the priest shall take of its blood with his finger , and shall sprinkle of its blood directly before the tent of meeting seven times .
DARBY	Numbers	19	5	And one shall burn the heifer before his eyes ; its skin and its flesh , and its blood , with its dung , shall he burn .
DARBY	Numbers	19	6	And the priest shall take cedar-wood , and hyssop , and scarlet , and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer .
DARBY	Numbers	19	7	And the priest shall wash his garments , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterwards he shall come into the camp ; and the priest shall be unclean until the even ;
DARBY	Numbers	19	8	and he that hath burned it shall wash his garments in water , and bathe his flesh in water , and shall be unclean until the even .
DARBY	Numbers	19	9	And a clean man shall gather the ashes of the heifer , and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place , and it shall be kept for the assembly of the children of Israel for a water of separation : it is a purification for sin .
DARBY	Numbers	19	10	And he that hath gathered the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even . And it shall be unto the children of Israel , and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them , an everlasting statute .
DARBY	Numbers	19	11	He that toucheth a dead person , any dead body of a man , shall be unclean seven days .
DARBY	Numbers	19	12	He shall purify himself with it on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean ; but if he purify not himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
DARBY	Numbers	19	13	Whoever toucheth a dead person , the dead body of a man that is dead , and purifieth not himself , defileth the tabernacle of Jehovah ; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel ; for the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him : he shall be unclean ; his uncleanness is yet upon him .
DARBY	Numbers	19	14	This is the law , when a man dieth in a tent : every one that cometh into the tent , and all that is in the tent , shall be unclean seven days .
DARBY	Numbers	19	15	And every open vessel , which hath no covering bound upon it , shall be unclean .
DARBY	Numbers	19	16	And every one that toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields , or a dead person , or the bone of a man , or a grave , shall be unclean seven days .
DARBY	Numbers	19	17	And they shall take for the unclean of the ashes of the purification-offering that hath been burned , and shall put running water thereon in a vessel ;
DARBY	Numbers	19	18	and a clean man shall take hyssop , and dip it in the water , and sprinkle it on the tent , and upon all the utensils , and upon the persons that were there , and upon him that hath touched the bone , or the one slain , or the dead person , or the grave ;
DARBY	Numbers	19	20	And the man that is unclean , and doth not purify himself , that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the congregation , for he hath defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah : the water of separation hath not been sprinkled on him : he is unclean .
DARBY	Numbers	19	21	And it shall be an everlasting statute unto them . And he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his garments , and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even .
DARBY	Numbers	19	22	And whatever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean ; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even .
DARBY	Numbers	20	20	And he said , Thou shalt not go through . And Edom came out against him with much people , and with a strong hand .
DARBY	Numbers	20	2	And there was no water for the assembly , and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron .
DARBY	Numbers	20	3	And the people contended with Moses , and spoke , saying , Would that we had died when our brethren died before Jehovah !
DARBY	Numbers	20	4	And why have ye brought the congregation of Jehovah into this wilderness , that we should die there , we and our beasts ?
DARBY	Numbers	20	5	And why have ye made us to go up out of Egypt , to bring us to this evil place ? it is no place of seed , or of figs , or of vines , or of pomegranates , neither is there any water to drink .
DARBY	Numbers	20	6	And Moses and Aaron went from before the congregation to the entrance of the tent of meeting , and fell upon their faces ; and the glory of Jehovah appeared to them .
DARBY	Numbers	20	7	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	20	8	Take the staff , and gather the assembly together , thou , and Aaron thy brother , and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes , and it shall give its water ; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock , and shalt give the assembly and their beasts drink .
DARBY	Numbers	20	9	And Moses took the staff from before Jehovah , as he had commanded him .
DARBY	Numbers	20	10	And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock , and he said to them , Hear now , ye rebels : shall we bring forth to you water out of this rock ?
DARBY	Numbers	20	11	And Moses lifted up his hand , and with his staff smote the rock twice , and much water came out , and the assembly drank , and their beasts .
DARBY	Numbers	20	12	And Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron , Because ye believed me not , to hallow me before the eyes of the children of Israel , therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land that I have given them .
DARBY	Numbers	20	13	These are the waters of Meribah , where the children of Israel contended with Jehovah , and he hallowed himself in them .
DARBY	Numbers	20	14	And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom , Thus says thy brother Israel : Thou knowest all the trouble that hath befallen us ,
DARBY	Numbers	20	15	how our fathers went down to Egypt , and we dwelt in Egypt a long time , and the Egyptians evil entreated us and our fathers ;
DARBY	Numbers	20	16	and when we cried to Jehovah , he heard our voice , and sent an angel , and brought us forth out of Egypt ; and behold , we are at Kadesh , a city at the extremity of thy border .
DARBY	Numbers	20	17	Let us pass , I pray thee , through thy country ; we will not pass through fields , or through vineyards , neither will we drink water out of the wells : we will go by the king 's road ; we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left , until we have passed thy border .
DARBY	Numbers	20	18	But Edom said to him , Thou shalt not pass by me , lest I come out against thee with the sword .
DARBY	Numbers	20	19	And the children of Israel said to him , We will go by the high way ; and if we drink of thy water , I and my cattle , then I will pay for it : I will only , without anything else , go through on my feet .
DARBY	Numbers	20	21	Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory ; and Israel turned away from him .
DARBY	Numbers	20	22	And they removed from Kadesh ; and the children of Israel , the whole assembly , came to mount Hor .
DARBY	Numbers	20	23	And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron in mount Hor , on the border of the land of Edom , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	20	24	Aaron shall be gathered unto his peoples ; for he shall not enter into the land that I have given unto the children of Israel , because ye rebelled against my commandment at the waters of Meribah .
DARBY	Numbers	20	25	Take Aaron and Eleazar his son , and bring them up unto mount Hor ,
DARBY	Numbers	20	26	and strip Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar his son ; and Aaron shall be gathered [ to his peoples ] , and shall die there .
DARBY	Numbers	20	27	And Moses did as Jehovah had commanded , and they went up mount Hor before the eyes of the whole assembly .
DARBY	Numbers	20	28	And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar his son ; and Aaron died there upon the top of the mountain ; and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain .
DARBY	Numbers	20	29	And the whole assembly saw that Aaron was dead , and they mourned for Aaron thirty days , [ even ] the whole house of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	21	21	And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	21	2	Then Israel vowed a vow to Jehovah , and said , If thou give this people wholly into my hand , then I will utterly destroy their cities .
DARBY	Numbers	21	3	And Jehovah listened to the voice of Israel , and delivered up the Canaanites ; and they utterly destroyed them , and their cities . And they called the name of the place Hormah .
DARBY	Numbers	21	4	And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea , to go round the land of Edom ; and the soul of the people became impatient on the way ;
DARBY	Numbers	21	5	and the people spoke against God , and against Moses , Why have ye brought us up out of Egypt that we should die in the wilderness ? for there is no bread , and no water , and our soul loathes this light bread .
DARBY	Numbers	21	6	Then Jehovah sent fiery serpents among the people , which bit the people ; and much people of Israel died .
DARBY	Numbers	21	7	And the people came to Moses and said , We have sinned , in that we have spoken against Jehovah , and against thee : pray to Jehovah that he take away the serpents from us . And Moses prayed for the people .
DARBY	Numbers	21	8	And Jehovah said to Moses , Make thee a fiery [ serpent ] , and set it upon a pole ; and it shall come to pass , that every one that is bitten , and looketh upon it , shall live .
DARBY	Numbers	21	9	And Moses made a serpent of brass , and put it upon a pole ; and it came to pass , if a serpent had bitten any man , and he beheld the serpent of brass , he lived .
DARBY	Numbers	21	10	And the children of Israel journeyed , and encamped in Oboth .
DARBY	Numbers	21	11	And they removed from Oboth , and encamped at Ijim-Abarim , in the wilderness that is before Moab , toward the sun-rising .
DARBY	Numbers	21	12	From thence they removed , and encamped at the torrent Zered .
DARBY	Numbers	21	13	From thence they removed , and encamped on the other side of the Arnon , which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites . For the Arnon is the border of Moab , between Moab and the Amorites .
DARBY	Numbers	21	14	Therefore it is said in the book of the wars of Jehovah , Vaheb in Suphah , and the brooks of Arnon ;
DARBY	Numbers	21	15	And the stream of the brooks which turneth to the dwelling of Ar , And inclineth toward the border of Moab .
DARBY	Numbers	21	16	And from thence to Beer : that is the well of which Jehovah spoke to Moses , Assemble the people , and I will give them water .
DARBY	Numbers	21	17	Then Israel sang this song , Rise up , well ! sing unto it :
DARBY	Numbers	21	18	Well which princes digged , which the nobles of the people hollowed out at [ the word of ] the lawgiver , with their staves . And from the wilderness [ they went ] to Mattanah ;
DARBY	Numbers	21	19	and from Mattanah to Nahaliel ; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth ;
DARBY	Numbers	21	20	and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the fields of Moab , to the top of Pisgah , which looks over the surface of the waste .
DARBY	Numbers	21	22	Let us pass through thy land ; we will not turn into the fields , or into the vineyards ; we will not drink water out of the wells ; on the king 's road will we go until we have passed thy border .
DARBY	Numbers	21	23	But Sihon would not suffer Israel to go through his border ; and Sihon gathered all his people , and went out against Israel into the wilderness , and came to Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	21	24	And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword , and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok , even unto the children of Ammon ; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong .
DARBY	Numbers	21	25	And Israel took all these cities , and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites , at Heshbon , and in all its dependent villages .
DARBY	Numbers	21	26	For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites ; and he had fought against the former king of Moab , and had taken all his land out of his hand , even unto the Arnon .
DARBY	Numbers	21	27	Therefore the poets say , Come to Heshbon ; let the city of Sihon be built and established .
DARBY	Numbers	21	28	For there went forth fire from Heshbon , a flame from the city of Sihon ; It consumed Ar of Moab , the lords of the high places of the Arnon .
DARBY	Numbers	21	29	Woe to thee , Moab ! thou art undone , people of Chemosh : He gave his sons that had escaped , and his daughters into captivity to Sihon the king of the Amorites .
DARBY	Numbers	21	30	And we have shot at them ; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon ; and we have laid [ them ] waste even unto Nophah , which reacheth unto Medeba .
DARBY	Numbers	21	31	And Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites .
DARBY	Numbers	21	32	And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer , and they took its dependent villages , and he dispossessed the Amorites that were there .
DARBY	Numbers	21	33	And they turned and went up by the way to Bashan ; and Og the king of Bashan went out against them , he and all his people , for battle to Edrei .
DARBY	Numbers	21	34	And Jehovah said to Moses , Fear him not ! for into thy hand have I given him , and all his people , and his land ; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon the king of the Amorites , who dwelt at Heshbon .
DARBY	Numbers	21	35	And they smote him , and his sons , and all his people , so that they left him none remaining , and took possession of his land .
DARBY	Numbers	22	22	And God 's anger was kindled because he went ; and the Angel of Jehovah set himself in the way to withstand him . Now he was riding upon his ass , and his two young men were with him .
DARBY	Numbers	22	2	And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites .
DARBY	Numbers	22	3	And Moab was much afraid of the people , because they were many ; and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	22	4	And Moab said to the elders of Midian , Now will this company lick up all that is round about us , as an ox licks up the green herb of the field . Now Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time .
DARBY	Numbers	22	5	And he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor , to Pethor , which is on the river in the land of the children of his people , to call him , saying , Behold , a people is come out from Egypt ; behold , they cover the face of the land , and they abide over against me .
DARBY	Numbers	22	6	And now come , I pray thee , curse me this people ; for they are mightier than I : perhaps I may be able to smite them , and drive them out of the land ; for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed , and he whom thou cursest is cursed .
DARBY	Numbers	22	7	And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed , having the rewards of divination in their hand . And they came to Balaam , and spoke to him the words of Balak .
DARBY	Numbers	22	8	And he said to them , Lodge here this night , and I will bring you word again , according as Jehovah shall speak unto me . And the princes of Moab abode with Balaam .
DARBY	Numbers	22	9	And God came to Balaam , and said , Who are these men with thee ?
DARBY	Numbers	22	10	And Balaam said to God , Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , hath sent unto me ,
DARBY	Numbers	22	11	Behold , a people is come out of Egypt , and it covers the face of the land . Now come , curse me them : perhaps I may be able to fight against them , and drive them out .
DARBY	Numbers	22	12	And God said to Balaam , Thou shalt not go with them ; thou shalt not curse the people ; for they are blessed .
DARBY	Numbers	22	13	And Balaam rose up in the morning , and said to the princes of Balak , Go into your land ; for Jehovah refuses to give me leave to go with you .
DARBY	Numbers	22	14	And the princes of Moab rose up ; and they went to Balak , and said , Balaam has refused to come with us .
DARBY	Numbers	22	15	Then sent Balak yet again princes , more , and more honourable than they .
DARBY	Numbers	22	16	And they came to Balaam , and said to him , Thus says Balak the son of Zippor : Suffer not thyself , I pray thee , to be restrained from coming to me ;
DARBY	Numbers	22	17	for very highly will I honour thee , and whatever thou shalt say to me will I do ; come therefore , I pray thee , curse me this people .
DARBY	Numbers	22	18	And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak , If Balak give me his house full of silver and gold , I could not go beyond the commandment of Jehovah my God , to do less or more .
DARBY	Numbers	22	19	And now , I pray you , abide ye also here this night , and I shall know what Jehovah will say to me further .
DARBY	Numbers	22	20	Then God came to Balaam at night , and said to him , If the men have come to call thee , rise up , [ and ] go with them ; but only what I shall say unto thee shalt thou do .
DARBY	Numbers	22	21	And Balaam rose up in the morning , and saddled his ass , and went with the princes of Moab .
DARBY	Numbers	22	23	And the ass saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand ; and the ass turned aside out of the way , and went into the field , and Balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way .
DARBY	Numbers	22	24	And the Angel of Jehovah stood in a hollow of the vineyards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
DARBY	Numbers	22	25	And the ass saw the Angel of Jehovah , and she pressed herself against the wall , and crushed Balaam 's foot against the wall ; and he smote her again .
DARBY	Numbers	22	26	Then the Angel of Jehovah went still further , and stood in a narrow place , where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left .
DARBY	Numbers	22	27	And the ass saw the Angel of Jehovah , and lay down under Balaam ; and Balaam 's anger was kindled , and he smote the ass with his staff .
DARBY	Numbers	22	28	And Jehovah opened the mouth of the ass , and she said to Balaam , What have I done to thee , that thou hast smitten me these three times ?
DARBY	Numbers	22	29	And Balaam said to the ass , Because thou hast mocked me : I would there were a sword in my hand , for now would I kill thee !
DARBY	Numbers	22	30	And the ass said to Balaam , Am not I thine ass , upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine to this day ? was I ever wont to do so to thee ? And he said , No .
DARBY	Numbers	22	31	Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand ; and he bowed and prostrated himself on his face .
DARBY	Numbers	22	32	And the Angel of Jehovah said to him , Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times ? behold , it was I who came forth to withstand thee , for the way [ thou walkest in ] is for ruin before me .
DARBY	Numbers	22	33	And the ass saw me , and turned from me these three times ; had she not turned from me , I had now certainly slain thee , and saved her alive .
DARBY	Numbers	22	34	And Balaam said to the Angel of Jehovah , I have sinned ; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me ; and now , if it be evil in thine eyes , I will get me back again .
DARBY	Numbers	22	35	And the Angel of Jehovah said to Balaam , Go with the men , but only the word that I shall speak unto thee , that shalt thou speak . And Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
DARBY	Numbers	22	36	And when Balak heard that Balaam came , he went out to meet him , to the city of Moab , which is on the border of the Arnon , which is at the extremity of the border .
DARBY	Numbers	22	37	And Balak said to Balaam , Did I not earnestly send to thee to call thee ? why didst thou not come to me ? am I not surely able to honour thee ?
DARBY	Numbers	22	38	And Balaam said to Balak , Lo , I am come to thee ; but shall I now be able at all to say anything ? the word that God puts in my mouth , that shall I speak .
DARBY	Numbers	22	39	And Balaam went with Balak , and they came to Kirjath-huzoth .
DARBY	Numbers	22	40	And Balak offered oxen and small cattle , and sent to Balaam and to the princes that were with him .
DARBY	Numbers	22	41	And it came to pass on the morrow , that Balak took Balaam , and brought him up to the high places of Baal , and he saw from thence the extremity of the people .
DARBY	Numbers	23	23	For there is no enchantment against Jacob , neither is there any divination against Israel . At this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel , What hath God wrought !
DARBY	Numbers	23	2	And Balak did as Balaam had said ; and Balak and Balaam offered up a bullock and a ram on [ each ] altar .
DARBY	Numbers	23	3	And Balaam said to Balak , Stand by thy burnt-offering , and I will go ; perhaps Jehovah will come to meet me ; and whatever he shews me I will tell thee . And he went to a hill .
DARBY	Numbers	23	4	And God met Balaam ; and [ Balaam ] said to him , I have disposed seven altars , and have offered up a bullock and a ram upon [ each ] altar .
DARBY	Numbers	23	5	And Jehovah put a word in Balaam 's mouth , and said , Return to Balak , and thus shalt thou speak .
DARBY	Numbers	23	6	And he returned to him , and behold , he was standing by his burnt-offering , he , and all the princes of Moab .
DARBY	Numbers	23	7	And he took up his parable , and said , Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram , from the mountains of the east : Come , curse me Jacob , and come , denounce Israel !
DARBY	Numbers	23	8	How shall I curse whom God hath not cursed ? or how shall I denounce whom Jehovah doth not denounce ?
DARBY	Numbers	23	9	For from the top of the rocks I see him , and from the hills I behold him : Lo , [ it is ] a people that shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations .
DARBY	Numbers	23	10	Who can count the dust of Jacob , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ? Let my soul die the death of the righteous , and let my end be like his !
DARBY	Numbers	23	11	And Balak said to Balaam , What hast thou done to me ? I took thee to curse mine enemies , and behold , thou hast blessed them altogether .
DARBY	Numbers	23	12	And he answered and said , Must I not take heed to speak that which Jehovah puts in my mouth ?
DARBY	Numbers	23	13	And Balak said to him , Come , I pray thee , with me to another place , from whence thou wilt see them ; thou shalt see only the extremity of them and shalt not see them all , and curse me them from thence .
DARBY	Numbers	23	14	And he took him to the watchmen 's field , to the top of Pisgah , and built seven altars , and offered up a bullock and a ram on [ each ] altar .
DARBY	Numbers	23	15	And [ Balaam ] said to Balak , Stand here by thy burnt-offering , and I will go to meet yonder .
DARBY	Numbers	23	16	And Jehovah met Balaam , and put a word in his mouth , and said , Return to Balak , and thus shalt thou speak .
DARBY	Numbers	23	17	And he came to him , and behold , he was standing by his burnt-offering , and the princes of Moab with him ; and Balak said to him , What has Jehovah spoken ?
DARBY	Numbers	23	18	Then he took up his parable and said , Rise up , Balak , and hear ! hearken unto me , son of Zippor !
DARBY	Numbers	23	19	God is not a man , that he should lie ; neither a son of man , that he should repent . Shall he say and not do ? and shall he speak and not make it good ?
DARBY	Numbers	23	20	Behold , I have received [ mission ] to bless ; and he hath blessed , and I can not reverse it .
DARBY	Numbers	23	21	He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob , neither hath he seen wrong in Israel ; Jehovah his God is with him , and the shout of a king is in his midst .
DARBY	Numbers	23	22	God brought him out of Egypt ; he hath as it were the strength of a buffalo .
DARBY	Numbers	23	24	Lo , the people will rise up as a lioness , and lift himself up as a lion . He shall not lie down until he have eaten the prey and drunk the blood of the slain .
DARBY	Numbers	23	25	And Balak said to Balaam , Neither curse them at all , nor bless them at all .
DARBY	Numbers	23	26	And Balaam answered and said to Balak , Did I not tell thee , saying , All that Jehovah shall speak , that will I do ?
DARBY	Numbers	23	27	And Balak said to Balaam , Come , I pray thee , I will bring thee to another place ; perhaps it will be right in the sight of God that thou curse me them from thence .
DARBY	Numbers	23	28	And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor , which looks over the surface of the waste .
DARBY	Numbers	23	29	And Balaam said to Balak , Build me here seven altars , and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams .
DARBY	Numbers	23	30	And Balak did as Balaam had said , and offered up a bullock and a ram on each altar .
DARBY	Numbers	24	24	And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim , and afflict Asshur , and afflict Eber , and he also shall be for destruction .
DARBY	Numbers	24	2	And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel dwelling [ in tents ] according to his tribes ; and the Spirit of God came upon him .
DARBY	Numbers	24	3	And he took up his parable , and said , Balaam the son of Beor saith , and the man of opened eye saith ,
DARBY	Numbers	24	4	He saith , who heareth the words of God , who seeth the vision of the Almighty , who falleth down , and who hath his eyes open :
DARBY	Numbers	24	5	How goodly are thy tents , Jacob , and thy tabernacles , Israel !
DARBY	Numbers	24	6	Like valleys are they spread forth , like gardens by the river side , Like aloe-trees which Jehovah hath planted , like cedars beside the waters .
DARBY	Numbers	24	7	Water shall flow out of his buckets , and his seed shall be in great waters , And his king shall be higher than Agag , and his kingdom shall be exalted .
DARBY	Numbers	24	8	God brought him out of Egypt ; he hath as it were the strength of a buffalo . He shall consume the nations his enemies , and break their bones , and with his arrows shall smite [ them ] in pieces .
DARBY	Numbers	24	9	He stooped , he lay down like a lion , and like a lioness : who will stir him up ? Blessed is he that blesseth thee , and cursed is he that curseth thee .
DARBY	Numbers	24	10	Then Balak 's anger was kindled against Balaam , and he smote his hands together ; and Balak said to Balaam , I called thee to curse mine enemies , and behold , thou hast altogether blessed [ them ] these three times !
DARBY	Numbers	24	11	And now flee thou to thy place ; I said I would very highly honour thee , and behold , Jehovah has kept thee back from honour .
DARBY	Numbers	24	12	And Balaam said to Balak , Did I not also speak to thy messengers whom thou sentest to me , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	24	13	If Balak gave me his house full of silver and gold , I could not go beyond the commandment of Jehovah to do good or bad out of my heart : what Jehovah shall say , that will I speak ?
DARBY	Numbers	24	14	And now behold , I go to my people : come , I will admonish thee what this people will do to thy people at the end of days .
DARBY	Numbers	24	15	And he took up his parable , and said , Balaam the son of Beor saith , and the man of opened eye saith ,
DARBY	Numbers	24	16	He saith , who heareth the words of God , who knoweth the knowledge of the Most High , Who seeth the vision of the Almighty , who falleth down , and who hath his eyes open :
DARBY	Numbers	24	17	I shall see him , but not now ; I shall behold him , but not nigh : There cometh a Star out of Jacob , and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel , and he shall cut in pieces the corners of Moab , and destroy all the sons of tumult .
DARBY	Numbers	24	18	And Edom shall be a possession , and Seir a possession , —they , his enemies ; but Israel will do valiantly .
DARBY	Numbers	24	19	And one out of Jacob shall have dominion , and will destroy out of the city what remaineth .
DARBY	Numbers	24	20	And he saw Amalek , and took up his parable , and said , Amalek is the first of the nations , but his latter end shall be for destruction .
DARBY	Numbers	24	21	And he saw the Kenites , and took up his parable , and said , Firm is thy dwelling-place , and thy nest fixed in the rock ;
DARBY	Numbers	24	22	But the Kenite shall be consumed , until Asshur shall carry thee away captive .
DARBY	Numbers	24	23	And he took up his parable , and said , Alas ! Who shall live when God doeth this ?
DARBY	Numbers	24	25	And Balaam rose up , and went and returned to his place ; and Balak also went his way .
DARBY	Numbers	25	25	And Israel abode in Shittim ; and the people began to commit fornication with the daughters of Moab .
DARBY	Numbers	25	2	And they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods ; and the people ate , and bowed down to their gods .
DARBY	Numbers	25	3	And Israel joined himself to Baal-Peor ; and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	25	4	And Jehovah said to Moses , Take all the heads of the people , and hang them up to Jehovah before the sun , that the fierce anger of Jehovah may be turned away from Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	25	5	And Moses said to the judges of Israel , Slay every one his men that have joined themselves to Baal-Peor .
DARBY	Numbers	25	6	And behold , a man of the children of Israel came and brought a Midianitish woman to his brethren , in the sight of Moses , and in the sight of the whole assembly of the children of Israel , who were weeping before the entrance of the tent of meeting .
DARBY	Numbers	25	7	And Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , saw it , and rose up from among the assembly , and took a javelin in his hand ,
DARBY	Numbers	25	8	and he went after the man of Israel into the tent-chamber , and thrust both of them through , the man of Israel and the woman through her belly . And the plague was stayed from the children of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	25	9	And those that died in the plague were twenty-four thousand .
DARBY	Numbers	25	10	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	25	11	Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel , in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them , so that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy .
DARBY	Numbers	25	12	Therefore say , Behold , I give unto him my covenant of peace !
DARBY	Numbers	25	13	And he shall have it , and his seed after him , the covenant of an everlasting priesthood ; because he was jealous for his God , and made atonement for the children of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	25	14	And the name of the man of Israel that was slain , who was slain with the Midianitish woman , was Zimri , the son of Salu , the prince of a father 's house of the Simeonites .
DARBY	Numbers	25	15	And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi , the daughter of Zur ; he was tribal head of a father 's house in Midian .
DARBY	Numbers	25	16	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	25	17	Harass the Midianites , and smite them ,
DARBY	Numbers	25	18	for they have harassed you with their wiles , wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor , and in the matter of Cozbi , the daughter of a prince of Midian , their sister , who was slain on the day of the plague because of the matter of Peor .

DARBY	Numbers	27	4	Why should the name of our father be taken away from his family , because he has no son ? Give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father .

DARBY	Numbers	27	7	The daughters of Zelophehad speak right : thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father 's brethren ; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them .
DARBY	Numbers	27	8	And unto the children of Israel shalt thou speak , saying , If a man die , and have no son , then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter .

DARBY	Numbers	27	13	And when thou hast seen it , thou also shalt be gathered unto thy peoples , as Aaron thy brother was gathered ,
DARBY	Numbers	27	14	because ye rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin , in the strife of the congregation , as to hallowing me in the matter of the water before their eyes . ( That is the water of Meribah at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin . )
DARBY	Numbers	27	15	And Moses spoke to Jehovah , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	27	16	Let Jehovah , the God of the spirits of all flesh , set a man over the assembly ,
DARBY	Numbers	27	17	who may go out before them , and who may come in before them , and who may lead them out , and who may bring them in , that the assembly of Jehovah be not as sheep that have no shepherd .
DARBY	Numbers	27	18	And Jehovah said to Moses , Take Joshua the son of Nun , a man in whom is the Spirit , and thou shalt lay thy hand upon him ;
DARBY	Numbers	27	19	and thou shalt set him before Eleazar the priest , and before the whole assembly ; and give him commandment before their eyes .
DARBY	Numbers	27	20	And thou shalt put of thine honour upon him , that the whole assembly of the children of Israel may obey him .
DARBY	Numbers	27	21	And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest , who shall inquire for him , by the judgment of the Urim before Jehovah : at his word shall they go out , and at his word they shall come in , he , and all the children of Israel with him , even the whole assembly .
DARBY	Numbers	27	22	And Moses did as Jehovah had commanded him ; and he took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest , and before the whole assembly .

DARBY	Numbers	29	38	and one he-goat for a sin-offering , —besides the continual burnt-offering and its oblation and its drink-offering .
DARBY	Numbers	29	39	These shall ye offer to Jehovah in your set feasts , besides your vows , and your voluntary-offerings , for your burnt-offerings , and for your oblations , and for your drink-offerings , and for your peace-offerings .
DARBY	Numbers	29	40	And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses .
DARBY	Numbers	30	30	And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel , saying , This is what Jehovah hath commanded .
DARBY	Numbers	30	2	If a man vow a vow to Jehovah , or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond , he shall not break his word ; according to all that hath gone out of his mouth shall he do .
DARBY	Numbers	30	3	If a woman also vow a vow to Jehovah , and bind herself by a bond , in her father 's house in her youth ,
DARBY	Numbers	30	4	and her father hear her vow , and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul , and her father shall be silent at her , then all her vows shall stand , and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand .
DARBY	Numbers	30	5	But if her father prohibited her in the day that he heard , none of her vows , or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul , shall stand ; and Jehovah shall pardon her , because her father prohibited her .
DARBY	Numbers	30	6	And if she have a husband , when she hath her vow upon her or ought that hath passed her lips wherewith she hath bound her soul ,
DARBY	Numbers	30	7	and her husband hear it and be silent at her in the day that he heareth it , then her vows shall stand , and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand .
DARBY	Numbers	30	8	But if her husband prohibit her on the day that he heareth it , and annul her vow which is upon her , and what hath passed her lips , wherewith she hath bound her soul , then Jehovah shall pardon her .
DARBY	Numbers	30	9	But the vow of a widow , and of her that is divorced , —everything wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand against her .
DARBY	Numbers	30	10	And if she have vowed in her husband 's house , or have bound her soul by an oath with a bond ,
DARBY	Numbers	30	11	and her husband have heard it , and been silent at her , and hath not prohibited her , then all her vows shall stand , and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand .
DARBY	Numbers	30	12	But if her husband have expressly annulled them on the day that he heard them , then nothing of that which is gone out of her lips as to her vows or the bond on her soul , shall stand : her husband hath annulled them ; and Jehovah will pardon her .
DARBY	Numbers	30	13	Every vow , and every binding oath to afflict the soul , her husband can establish it , or her husband can annul it .
DARBY	Numbers	30	14	And if her husband be altogether silent at her from day to day , then he hath established all her vows or all her bonds which are upon her ; he hath confirmed them , for he hath been silent at her in the day that he heard them .
DARBY	Numbers	30	15	But if he in any way annul them after he hath heard them , then he shall bear her iniquity .
DARBY	Numbers	30	16	These are the statutes , which Jehovah commanded Moses , between a man and his wife , between a father and his daughter , in her youth in her father 's house .
DARBY	Numbers	31	31	And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Jehovah had commanded Moses .
DARBY	Numbers	31	2	Avenge the children of Israel upon the Midianites ; afterwards shalt thou be gathered unto thy peoples .
DARBY	Numbers	31	3	And Moses spoke to the people , saying , Arm from amongst you men for military service , that they go against Midian to execute Jehovah 's vengeance upon Midian .
DARBY	Numbers	31	4	Of every tribe a thousand , of all the tribes of Israel , shall ye send to the war .
DARBY	Numbers	31	5	And there were levied out of the thousands of Israel , a thousand by tribe , twelve thousand armed for war .
DARBY	Numbers	31	6	And Moses sent them to the war , a thousand by the tribe , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , and the holy instruments , even the alarm-trumpets in his hand .
DARBY	Numbers	31	7	And they warred against Midian , as Jehovah had commanded Moses , and slew all the males .
DARBY	Numbers	31	8	And they slew the kings of Midian , besides the others slain , Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , five kings of Midian ; and Balaam the son of Beor they slew with the sword .
DARBY	Numbers	31	9	And the children of Israel took the women of Midian captives , and their little ones , and took for a spoil all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods ;
DARBY	Numbers	31	10	and all their cities in their settlements and all their encampments they burned with fire .
DARBY	Numbers	31	11	And they took all the booty , and all the prey , of man and of cattle ;
DARBY	Numbers	31	12	and they brought to Moses and Eleazar the priest , and to the assembly of the children of Israel , the captives and the prey and the booty , to the camp in the plains of Moab , which are by the Jordan of Jericho .
DARBY	Numbers	31	13	And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the assembly went forth to meet them outside the camp .
DARBY	Numbers	31	14	And Moses was wroth with the officers of the army , with the captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds , who came from the service of the war ;
DARBY	Numbers	31	15	and Moses said to them , Have ye saved all the women alive ?
DARBY	Numbers	31	16	Lo , these , through the counsel of Balaam , caused the children of Israel to commit sin against Jehovah in the matter of Peor , and there was a plague on the assembly of Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	31	17	And now slay every male among the little ones , and slay every woman that hath known man by lying with him ,
DARBY	Numbers	31	18	but all the children among the women that have not known lying with a man , keep alive for yourselves .
DARBY	Numbers	31	19	And encamp outside the camp seven days ; whoever hath killed a person , and whoever hath touched any slain ; ye shall purify yourselves on the third day , and on the seventh day , you and your captives .
DARBY	Numbers	31	20	And every garment , and every vessel of skin , and all work of goat 's hair , and every utensil of wood shall ye purify .
DARBY	Numbers	31	21	And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war that had gone to the battle , This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded Moses .
DARBY	Numbers	31	22	Only the gold , and the silver , the copper , the iron , the tin , and the lead ,
DARBY	Numbers	31	23	everything that passeth through the fire , ye shall make it go through the fire , and it shall be clean ; only it shall be purified with the water of separation ; and everything that can not pass through the fire ye shall make go through the water .
DARBY	Numbers	31	24	And ye shall wash your garments on the seventh day , and ye shall be clean ; and afterwards ye may come into the camp .
DARBY	Numbers	31	25	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	31	26	Take the sum of the prey that was taken , of man and of cattle , thou , and Eleazar the priest , and the chief fathers of the assembly ;
DARBY	Numbers	31	27	and divide the prey into halves , between them that conducted the war , who went out to the battle , and the whole assembly .
DARBY	Numbers	31	28	And thou shalt levy a tribute for Jehovah of the men of war who went out to the army , one soul of five hundred of the persons , and of the oxen , and of the asses , and of the small cattle .
DARBY	Numbers	31	29	Of their half shall ye take it , and give it unto Eleazar the priest , for a heave-offering of Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	31	30	And of the children of Israel 's half , thou shalt take one portion of fifty , of the persons , of the oxen , of the asses , and of the small cattle , of every [ kind of ] beasts , and thou shalt give them unto the Levites , who keep the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	31	32	And the prey , the rest of the spoil , which the men of war had taken , was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep ,
DARBY	Numbers	31	33	and seventy-two thousand oxen ,
DARBY	Numbers	31	34	and sixty-one thousand asses ,
DARBY	Numbers	31	35	and of human persons , of the women that had not known lying with a man , all the persons were thirty-two thousand .
DARBY	Numbers	31	36	And the half , the portion of them that had gone out to the war , was in number three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep ,
DARBY	Numbers	31	37	and the tribute for Jehovah of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five ;
DARBY	Numbers	31	38	and the oxen were thirty-six thousand , and the tribute thereof for Jehovah , seventy-two ;
DARBY	Numbers	31	39	and the asses were thirty thousand five hundred , and the tribute thereof for Jehovah , sixty-one ;
DARBY	Numbers	31	40	and the human persons were sixteen thousand , of whom the tribute for Jehovah was thirty-two persons .
DARBY	Numbers	31	41	And Moses gave the tribute of Jehovah 's heave-offering to Eleazar the priest , as Jehovah had commanded Moses .
DARBY	Numbers	31	42	And of the children of Israel 's half , which Moses had divided , [ taking it ] from the men that served in the war ,
DARBY	Numbers	31	43	( now the half belonging to the assembly was of the sheep , three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred ,
DARBY	Numbers	31	44	and thirty-six thousand oxen ,
DARBY	Numbers	31	45	and thirty thousand five hundred asses ,
DARBY	Numbers	31	46	and sixteen thousand human persons , )
DARBY	Numbers	31	47	… of the children of Israel 's half , Moses took one portion of fifty , of man and of cattle , and gave them to the Levites who kept the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah ; as Jehovah had commanded Moses .
DARBY	Numbers	31	48	And the officers who were over the thousands of the host , the captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds , came near to Moses ,
DARBY	Numbers	31	49	and they said to Moses , Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war who were under our hand , and there is not one man of us lacking .
DARBY	Numbers	31	50	So we present the offering of Jehovah , that which each one hath found , jewels of gold , chains , and bracelets , rings , earrings , and necklaces , to make atonement for our souls before Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	31	51	And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them , all manner of wrought jewels .
DARBY	Numbers	31	52	And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered to Jehovah was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels , from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds .
DARBY	Numbers	31	53	( The men of war had taken spoil each one for himself . )
DARBY	Numbers	31	54	And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the tent of meeting , as a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	32	32	We will pass over armed before Jehovah into the land of Canaan , and the possession of our inheritance on this side the Jordan shall be ours .
DARBY	Numbers	32	2	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses , and to Eleazar the priest , and to the princes of the assembly , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	32	3	Ataroth , and Dibon , and Jaazer , and Nimrah , and Heshbon , and Elaleh , and Sebam , and Nebo , and Beon ,
DARBY	Numbers	32	4	the country that Jehovah smote before the assembly of Israel , is a land for cattle , and thy servants have cattle ;
DARBY	Numbers	32	5	and they said , If we have found favour in thine eyes , let this land be given to thy servants for a possession : bring us not over the Jordan .
DARBY	Numbers	32	6	And Moses said to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , Shall your brethren go to war , and shall * ye * abide here ?
DARBY	Numbers	32	7	And why do ye discourage the children of Israel from going over into the land that Jehovah has given them ?
DARBY	Numbers	32	8	Thus did your fathers , when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land :
DARBY	Numbers	32	9	they went up to the valley of Eshcol , and saw the land , and discouraged the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land that Jehovah had given them .
DARBY	Numbers	32	10	And Jehovah 's anger was kindled the same time , and he swore , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	32	11	If the men that came up out of Egypt , from twenty years old and upward , shall see the land that I swore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob ! for they have not wholly followed me ;
DARBY	Numbers	32	12	save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite , and Joshua the son of Nun ; for they have wholly followed Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	32	13	And Jehovah 's anger was kindled against Israel , and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years , until the whole generation was consumed that had done evil in the eyes of Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	32	14	And behold , ye are risen up in your fathers ' stead , a progeny of sinful men , to augment yet the fierce anger of Jehovah toward Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	32	15	If ye turn away from after him , he will yet again leave them in the wilderness ; and ye shall destroy all this people .
DARBY	Numbers	32	16	And they drew near to him , and said , We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle , and cities for our little ones ;
DARBY	Numbers	32	17	but we ourselves will go with diligence armed before the children of Israel , until we have brought them to their place ; and our little ones shall dwell in the strong cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
DARBY	Numbers	32	18	We will not return to our houses , until the children of Israel have inherited each one his inheritance .
DARBY	Numbers	32	19	For we will not inherit with them on yonder side the Jordan , and further , because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side the Jordan eastward .
DARBY	Numbers	32	20	And Moses said to them , If ye do this thing , if ye arm yourselves before Jehovah for war ,
DARBY	Numbers	32	21	and all of you that are armed go over the Jordan before Jehovah , until he have dispossessed his enemies from before him ,
DARBY	Numbers	32	22	and the land is subdued before Jehovah , and afterwards ye return , ye shall be guiltless toward Jehovah and toward Israel , and this land shall be your possession before Jehovah .
DARBY	Numbers	32	23	But if ye do not do so , behold , ye have sinned against Jehovah , and be sure your sin will find you out .
DARBY	Numbers	32	24	Build yourselves cities for your little ones , and folds for your flocks , and do that which has gone out of your mouth .
DARBY	Numbers	32	25	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses , saying , Thy servants will do as my lord commands .
DARBY	Numbers	32	26	Our little ones , our wives , our cattle , and all our beasts shall be there in the cities of Gilead ;
DARBY	Numbers	32	27	but thy servants will pass over , every one armed for war , before Jehovah to battle , as my lord says .
DARBY	Numbers	32	28	So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of Nun , and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	32	29	And Moses said unto them , If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben pass with you over the Jordan , every one armed for battle , before Jehovah , and the land be subdued before you , then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession ;
DARBY	Numbers	32	30	but if they do not pass over with you armed , they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan .
DARBY	Numbers	32	31	And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered , saying , As Jehovah has said to thy servants , so will we do .
DARBY	Numbers	32	33	And Moses gave to them , to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph , the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites , and the kingdom of Og the king of Bashan , the land , according to its cities and territories , the cities of the land round about .
DARBY	Numbers	32	34	And the children of Gad built Dibon , and Ataroth , and Aroer ,

DARBY	Numbers	32	36	and Beth-Nimrah , and Beth-haran , strong cities , and sheepfolds .
DARBY	Numbers	32	37	—And the children of Reuben built Heshbon , and Elaleh , and Kirjathaim ,
DARBY	Numbers	32	38	and Nebo , and Baal-meon ( of which the names were changed ) , and Sibmah ; and they gave other names to the cities that they built .
DARBY	Numbers	32	39	—And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead , and took it , and they dispossessed the Amorites that were therein .
DARBY	Numbers	32	40	And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh ; and he dwelt therein .
DARBY	Numbers	32	41	And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took their hamlets , and called them Havoth-Jair .
DARBY	Numbers	32	42	And Nobah went and took Kenath , and its dependent villages , and called it Nobah , after his name .
DARBY	Numbers	33	33	And they removed from Hor-hagidgad , and encamped in Jotbathah .
DARBY	Numbers	33	2	And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Jehovah ; and these are their journeys according to their goings out .
DARBY	Numbers	33	3	They journeyed from Rameses in the first month , on the fifteenth day of the first month . On the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians .
DARBY	Numbers	33	4	And the Egyptians buried those whom Jehovah had smitten among them , all the firstborn ; and upon their gods Jehovah executed judgments .
DARBY	Numbers	33	5	And the children of Israel removed from Rameses , and encamped in Succoth .
DARBY	Numbers	33	6	And they removed from Succoth and encamped in Etham , which is at the end of the wilderness .

DARBY	Numbers	33	9	And they removed from Marah , and came to Elim ; and in Elim were twelve springs of water , and seventy palm-trees , and they encamped there .

DARBY	Numbers	33	49	And they encamped by the Jordan , from Beth-jeshimoth unto Abel-Shittim , in the plains of Moab .
DARBY	Numbers	33	50	And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan of Jericho , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	33	51	Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye pass over Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
DARBY	Numbers	33	52	then ye shall dispossess all the inhabitants of the land from before you , and ye shall destroy all their figured images , and all their molten images shall ye destroy , and all their high places shall ye lay waste ;
DARBY	Numbers	33	53	and ye shall take possession of the land , and dwell therein , for to you have I given the land to possess it .
DARBY	Numbers	33	54	And ye shall take for yourselves the land as an inheritance by lot according to your families : to the many ye shall increase their inheritance , and to the few thou shalt diminish their inheritance : where the lot falleth to him , there shall be each man 's [ inheritance ] ; according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye take for yourselves the inheritance .
DARBY	Numbers	33	55	But if ye will not dispossess the inhabitants of the land from before you , those that ye let remain of them shall be thorns in your eyes , and pricks in your sides , and they shall harass you in the land wherein ye dwell .
DARBY	Numbers	33	56	And it shall come to pass that I will do unto you as I thought to do unto them .
DARBY	Numbers	34	34	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	34	2	Command the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land of Canaan , this shall be the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance , the land of Canaan according to the borders thereof .
DARBY	Numbers	34	3	Then your south side shall be from the wilderness of Zin alongside of Edom , and your southern border shall be from the end of the salt sea eastward ;
DARBY	Numbers	34	4	and your border shall turn from the south of the ascent of Akrabbim , and pass on to Zin , and shall end southward at Kadesh-barnea , and shall go on to Hazar-Addar , and pass on to Azmon .

DARBY	Numbers	34	12	and the border shall go down to the Jordan , and shall end at the salt sea . This shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about .
DARBY	Numbers	34	13	And Moses commanded the children of Israel , saying , This is the land which ye shall take for yourselves as inheritance by lot , which Jehovah commanded to give to the nine tribes , and to the half tribe .
DARBY	Numbers	34	14	For the tribe of the children of the Reubenites according to their fathers ' houses , and the tribe of the children of the Gadites according to their fathers ' houses , have received , and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance ;

DARBY	Numbers	34	29	These are they whom Jehovah commanded to distribute to the children of Israel their inheritance in the land of Canaan .
DARBY	Numbers	35	35	And Jehovah spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan of Jericho , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	35	2	Command the children of Israel , that of the inheritance of their possession they give unto the Levites cities to dwell in ; and a suburb for the cities round about them shall ye give unto the Levites .
DARBY	Numbers	35	3	And the cities shall they have to dwell in , and their suburbs shall be for their cattle , and for their goods , and for all their beasts .
DARBY	Numbers	35	4	And the suburbs of the cities that ye shall give unto the Levites shall be from the walls of the city outward , a thousand cubits round about .
DARBY	Numbers	35	5	And ye shall measure , without the city , the east side two thousand cubits , and the south side two thousand cubits , and the west side two thousand cubits , and the north side two thousand cubits , and the city shall be in the midst : they shall have this as suburbs of the cities .
DARBY	Numbers	35	6	And [ among ] the cities that ye shall give unto the Levites [ shall be ] the six cities of refuge , which ye shall appoint for the manslayer , that he may flee thither , —and besides them ye shall give forty-two cities :
DARBY	Numbers	35	7	all the cities that ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities , they and their suburbs .
DARBY	Numbers	35	8	And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel : from them that have much ye shall take much , and from them that have little ye shall take little ; each one according to his inheritance which he will inherit shall give of his cities to the Levites .
DARBY	Numbers	35	9	And Jehovah spoke to Moses , saying ,
DARBY	Numbers	35	10	Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan ,
DARBY	Numbers	35	11	then ye shall appoint for yourselves cities : cities of refuge shall they be for you ; that a manslayer may flee thither , who without intent smiteth a person mortally .
DARBY	Numbers	35	12	And ye shall have these cities for refuge from the avenger ; that the manslayer die not , until he have stood before the assembly in judgment .
DARBY	Numbers	35	13	And the cities that ye shall give shall be six cities of refuge for you .
DARBY	Numbers	35	14	Three cities shall ye give on this side of the Jordan , and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan ; they shall be cities of refuge .
DARBY	Numbers	35	15	For the children of Israel , and for the stranger , and for the sojourner among them shall these six cities be a refuge , that one who smiteth a person mortally without intent may flee thither .
DARBY	Numbers	35	16	And if he have smitten him with an instrument of iron , so that he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall certainly be put to death .
DARBY	Numbers	35	17	And if he have smitten him with a stone from the hand , wherewith one may die , and he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall certainly be put to death .
DARBY	Numbers	35	18	Or if he have smitten him with an instrument of wood , in the hand , wherewith one may die , and he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall certainly be put to death ;
DARBY	Numbers	35	19	the avenger of blood , he shall put the murderer to death ; when he meeteth him , he shall put him to death .
DARBY	Numbers	35	20	And if he thrust at him out of hatred , or hurl at him intentionally , so that he die ,
DARBY	Numbers	35	21	or from enmity smite him with his hand , so that he die , he that smote him shall certainly be put to death ; he is a murderer : the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death , when he meeteth him.—
DARBY	Numbers	35	22	But if he have thrust at him suddenly without enmity , or have cast upon him anything unintentionally ,
DARBY	Numbers	35	23	or [ have smitten him ] with any stone wherewith one may die , without seeing him , and have cast it upon him so that he die , and he was not his enemy , neither sought his harm :
DARBY	Numbers	35	24	then the assembly shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood according to these judgments ;
DARBY	Numbers	35	25	and the assembly shall rescue the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood , and the assembly shall restore him to the city of his refuge , whither he had fled ; and he shall abide in it until the death of the high-priest , who was anointed with the holy oil .
DARBY	Numbers	35	26	But if the manslayer shall in any way come outside the limits of the city of his refuge whither he hath fled ,
DARBY	Numbers	35	27	and the avenger of blood find him outside the limits of his city of refuge , and the avenger of blood kill the manslayer , there shall be no blood-guiltiness upon him ;
DARBY	Numbers	35	28	for the manslayer should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high-priest ; but after the death of the high-priest he may return into the land of his possession .
DARBY	Numbers	35	29	And this shall be unto you a statute of right throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
DARBY	Numbers	35	30	Whoever shall smite a person mortally , at the mouth of witnesses shall the murderer be put to death ; but one witness shall not testify against a person to cause him to die .
DARBY	Numbers	35	31	And ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer , who is guilty of death , but he shall certainly be put to death .
DARBY	Numbers	35	32	And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that hath fled to the city of his refuge , that he should come again to dwell in the land , until the death of the priest .
DARBY	Numbers	35	33	And ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are ; for blood , it polluteth the land ; and there can be no atonement made for the land , for the blood that hath been shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it .
DARBY	Numbers	35	34	And ye shall not defile the land that ye inhabit , in the midst whereof I dwell ; for I am Jehovah who dwell in the midst of the children of Israel .
DARBY	Numbers	36	36	And the chief fathers of families of the sons of Gilead , the son of Machir , the son of Manasseh , of the families of the sons of Joseph , came near , and spoke before Moses , and before the princes , the chief fathers of the children of Israel :
DARBY	Numbers	36	2	and they said , Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel ; and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters .
DARBY	Numbers	36	3	Now if they be married to any of the sons of the [ other ] tribes of the children of Israel , then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers , and shall be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong ; and it shall be taken from the lot of our inheritance .
DARBY	Numbers	36	4	And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall come , then shall their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong ; and their inheritance shall be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers .
DARBY	Numbers	36	5	And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Jehovah , saying , The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well .
DARBY	Numbers	36	6	This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them marry whom they please ; only they shall marry one of the tribe of their father ,
DARBY	Numbers	36	7	that no inheritance of the children of Israel pass from tribe to tribe ; for every one of the children of Israel shall keep to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
DARBY	Numbers	36	8	And every daughter that possesseth an inheritance among the tribes of the children of Israel , shall be married to one of the family of the tribe of her father , that the children of Israel may possess every one the inheritance of his fathers ,
DARBY	Numbers	36	9	and the inheritance shall not pass from one tribe to another tribe ; for each of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep to his inheritance .
DARBY	Numbers	36	10	Even as Jehovah had commanded Moses , so did the daughters of Zelophehad ;
DARBY	Numbers	36	11	and Mahlah , Tirzah , and Hoglah , and Milcah , and Noah , the daughters of Zelophehad , were married unto their uncles ' sons .
DARBY	Numbers	36	12	To those that were of the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph were they married ; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
DARBY	Numbers	36	13	These are the commandments and the ordinances which Jehovah commanded through Moses to the children of Israel , in the plains of Moab , by the Jordan of Jericho .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	1	These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side the Jordan , in the wilderness , in the plain , opposite to Suph , between Paran and Tophel , Laban , Hazeroth , and Dizahab .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	2	There are eleven days ' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	3	And it came to pass in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first of the month , that Moses spoke to the children of Israel , according to all that Jehovah had given him in command to them ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	4	after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites , who dwelt at Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , who dwelt at Ashtaroth [ and ] at Edrei .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	5	On this side the Jordan , in the land of Moab , began Moses to unfold this law , saying ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	6	Jehovah our God spoke unto us in Horeb , saying , Ye have stayed long enough in this mountain .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	7	Turn and take your journey , and go to the hill-country of the Amorites , and unto all the neighbouring places in the plain , in the mountain , and in the lowland , and in the south , and by the seaside , the land of the Canaanites , and Lebanon , unto the great river , the river Euphrates .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	8	Behold , I have set the land before you : go in and possess the land which Jehovah swore unto your fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give unto them and to their seed after them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	9	And I spoke unto you at that time , saying , I am not able to bear you myself alone .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	10	Jehovah your God hath multiplied you , and behold , ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	11	Jehovah , the God of your fathers , make you a thousand times so many more as ye are , and bless you as he hath said unto you !
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	12	How can I myself alone sustain your wear , and your burden , and your strife ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	13	Provide you wise and understanding and known men , according to your tribes , that I may make them your chiefs .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	14	And ye answered me , and said , The thing that thou hast spoken is good [ for us ] to do .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	15	So I took the chiefs of your tribes , wise men and known , and made them chiefs over you , captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds , and captains of fifties , and captains of tens , and officers for your tribes .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	16	And I commanded your judges at that time , saying , Hear [ the causes ] between your brethren , and judge righteously between a man and his brother , and him also that sojourneth with him .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	17	Ye shall not respect persons in judgment : ye shall hear the small as well as the great ; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man , for the judgment is God 's ; and the matter that is too hard for you shall ye bring to me , that I may hear it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	18	And I commanded you at that time all the things that ye should do .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	19	And we departed from Horeb and went through all that great and terrible wilderness , which ye saw , on the way to the mountain of the Amorites , as Jehovah our God had commanded us ; and we came to Kadesh-barnea .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	20	And I said unto you , Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites , which Jehovah our God giveth us .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	21	Behold , Jehovah thy God hath set the land before thee : go up , take possession , as Jehovah the God of thy fathers hath said unto thee ; fear not , neither be dismayed .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	22	And ye came near to me all of you , and said , We will send men before us , who shall examine the land for us , and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up , and of the cities to which we shall come .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	23	And the matter was good in mine eyes ; and I took twelve men of you , one man for a tribe .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	24	And they turned and went up into the mountain , and came to the valley of Eshcol , and searched it out .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	25	And they took of the fruit of the land in their hand , and brought it down unto us , and brought us answer , and said , The land is good that Jehovah our God hath given us .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	26	But ye would not go up , and rebelled against the word of Jehovah your God ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	27	and ye murmured in your tents , and said , Because Jehovah hated us , he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	28	Whither shall we go up ? Our brethren have made our hearts melt , saying , [ They are ] a people greater and taller than we ; the cities are great and walled up to heaven ; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	29	And I said unto you , Be not afraid , neither fear them ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	30	Jehovah your God who goeth before you , he will fight for you , according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	31	and in the wilderness where thou hast seen that Jehovah thy God bore thee , as a man doth bear his son , in all the way that ye went , until ye came to this place .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	32	But In this thing ye did not believe Jehovah your God ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	33	who went in the way before you , to search you out a place for your encamping , in fire by night , to shew you by what way ye should go , and in the cloud by day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	34	And Jehovah heard the voice of your words , and was wroth , and swore , saying ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	35	None among these men , this evil generation , shall in any wise see that good land , which I swore to give unto your fathers !
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	36	Except Caleb the son of Jephunneh , he shall see it , and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon , and to his children , because he hath wholly followed Jehovah .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	37	Also Jehovah was angry with me on your account , saying , Thou also shalt not go in thither .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	38	Joshua the son of Nun , who standeth before thee , he shall go in thither : strengthen him , for he shall cause Israel to inherit it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	39	And your little ones , of whom ye said , They shall be a prey , and your children , who this day know neither good nor evil , they shall go in thither , and unto them will I give it , and they shall possess it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	40	But ye , turn , and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	41	—And ye answered and said unto me , We have sinned against Jehovah , we will go up and fight , according to all that Jehovah our God hath commanded us . And ye girded on every man his weapons of war , and ye would go presumptuously up the hill .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	42	And Jehovah said to me , Say unto them , Go not up , neither fight ; for I am not among you ; lest ye be smitten before your enemies .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	43	And I spoke unto you , but ye would not hear , and ye rebelled against the word of Jehovah , and acted presumptuously , and went up the hill .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	44	And the Amorite that dwelt on that hill came out against you , and chased you , like as bees do , and cut you in pieces in Seir , as far as Hormah .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	45	And ye returned and wept before Jehovah , but Jehovah would not listen to your voice , nor give ear unto you .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	1	46	And ye abode in Kadesh many days , according unto the days that ye abode [ there ] .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	2	And Jehovah spoke to me , saying ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	3	Ye have gone round this mountain long enough : turn you northward .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	4	And command the people , saying , Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau , who dwell in Seir ; and they will be afraid of you ; and ye shall be very guarded :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	5	attack them not ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as a foot-breadth ; for I have given mount Seir as a possession unto Esau .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	6	Ye shall buy of them food for money , that ye may eat ; and water shall ye also buy of them for money , that ye may drink ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	7	for Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand . He hath known thy walking through this great wilderness : these forty years hath Jehovah thy God been with thee ; thou hast lacked nothing .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	8	And we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau , who dwelt in Seir , by the plain , by Elath , and by Ezion-geber , and we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	9	And Jehovah said to me , Distress not the Moabites , neither engage with them in battle ; for I will not give thee of their land a possession ; for unto the children of Lot have I given Ar as a possession .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	10	( The Emim dwelt therein in times past , a people great , and many , and tall as the Anakim .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	11	They also are reckoned as giants like the Anakim ; but the Moabites call them Emim .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	12	And in Seir dwelt the Horites in times past ; and the children of Esau dispossessed them , and destroyed them from before them , and dwelt in their stead ; as Israel did to the land of their possession , which Jehovah gave to them . )
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	13	Now rise up , and pass over the torrent Zered . And we passed over the torrent Zered .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	14	Now the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea , until we had come over the torrent Zered , were thirty-eight years ; until the whole generation of the men of war was consumed from the midst of the camp , as Jehovah had sworn unto them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	15	Moreover the hand of Jehovah was against them to destroy them from the midst of the camp , until they were consumed .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	16	And it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed , having died off from among the people ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	17	that Jehovah spoke to me , saying ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	18	Thou art to pass this day over the border of Moab , [ which is ] Ar ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	19	and come near over against the children of Ammon ; thou shalt not distress them nor attack them ; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon a possession ; for unto the children of Lot have I given it as a possession .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	20	( That also is reckoned a land of giants : giants dwelt therein in time past , and the Ammonites call them Zamzummim ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	21	a people great , and many , and tall as the Anakim ; and Jehovah destroyed them before them , and they dispossessed them , and dwelt in their stead ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	22	as he did to the children of Esau , who dwelt in Seir , from before whom he destroyed the Horites ; and they dispossessed them , and dwelt in their stead , even to this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	23	And the Avvites who dwelt in the hamlets as far as Gazah—the Caphtorim , who came out of Caphtor , destroyed them , and dwelt in their stead . )
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	24	Rise up , take your journey , and pass over the river Arnon . Behold , I have given into thy hand Sihon the king of Heshbon , the Amorite , and his land : begin , take possession , and engage with him in battle .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	25	This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples under the whole heaven ; who will hear report of thee , and will tremble , and quake because of thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	26	And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon the king of Heshbon with words of peace , saying ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	27	Let me pass through thy land : by the highway alone will I go ; I will neither turn to the right hand nor to the left .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	28	Thou shalt sell me food for money that I may eat ; and thou shalt give me water for money that I may drink ; I will only pass through on my feet ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	29	—as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir , and the Moabites who dwell in Ar , did to me , —until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which Jehovah our God giveth us .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	30	But Sihon the king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him ; for Jehovah thy God hardened his spirit , and made his heart obdurate , that he might give him into thy hand , as it is this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	31	And Jehovah said to me , Behold , I begin to give Sihon and his land before thee : begin , take possession , that thou mayest possess his land .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	32	And Sihon came out against us for battle , he and all his people , to Jahaz .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	33	But Jehovah our God gave him up before us ; and we smote him , and his sons , and his whole people .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	34	And we took all his cities at that time , and utterly destroyed every city , men , and women , and little ones : we let none escape .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	35	Only the cattle we took as booty for ourselves , and the spoil of the cities which we took .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	36	From Aroer , which is on the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the ravine even to Gilead , there was not one city too strong for us : Jehovah our God delivered all before us .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	2	37	Only thou didst not approach the land of the children of Ammon , the whole border of the river Jabbok , nor the cities of the mountain , nor to whatsoever Jehovah our God had forbidden us .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	3	And Jehovah our God gave into our hand Og the king of Bashan also , and all his people ; and we smote him until none was left to him remaining .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	2	And Jehovah said to me , Fear him not ; for into thy hand have I given him , and all his people , and his land ; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon the king of the Amorites , who dwelt at Heshbon .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	4	And we took all his cities at that time : there was not a town which we took not from them , sixty cities , the whole region of Argob , the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	5	All these cities were fortified with high walls , gates , and bars ; besides unwalled towns very many .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	6	And we utterly destroyed them , as we had done to Sihon the king of Heshbon , utterly destroying every city , men , women and little ones .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	7	But all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took as booty for ourselves .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	8	And we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites , that were on this side the Jordan , from the river Arnon to mount Hermon
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	9	( the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion , and the Amorites call it Senir ) :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	10	all the cities of the plateau , and all Gilead , and all Bashan , as far as Salchah and Edrei , the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	11	For only Og the king of Bashan remained of the residue of giants : behold , his bedstead was a bedstead of iron ; is it not in Rabbah of the children of Ammon ? its length was nine cubits , and its breadth four cubits , after the cubit of a man .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	12	And this land we took in possession at that time . From Aroer , which is by the river Arnon , and the half of mount Gilead , and its cities , I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	13	and the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , the kingdom of Og , I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh . ( The whole region of Argob , even all Bashan , is called a land of giants .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	14	Jair the son of Manasseh took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites , and called Bashan after his own name , Havoth-Jair , to this day . )
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	15	And I gave Gilead to Machir .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	16	And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the river Arnon , the middle of the ravine and its border , as far as the river Jabbok , the border of the children of Ammon ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	17	the plain also , and the Jordan , and [ its ] border from Chinnereth as far as the sea of the plain , the salt sea , under the slopes of Pisgah eastward .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	18	And I commanded you at that time , saying , Jehovah your God hath given you this land to take possession of it : ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel , all [ who are ] combatants .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	19	Only your wives , and your little ones , and your cattle , —I know that ye have much cattle , —shall abide in your cities which I have given you ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	20	until Jehovah give rest to your brethren , as well as to you , and they also take possession of the land that Jehovah your God giveth them beyond the Jordan ; then shall ye return , each man to his possession , which I have given you .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	21	And I commanded Joshua at that time , saying , Thine eyes have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done to these two kings : so will Jehovah do to all the kingdoms to which thou shalt go .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	22	Ye shall not fear them ; for Jehovah your God , he will fight for you .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	23	And I besought Jehovah at that time , saying ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	24	Lord Jehovah , thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness , and thy powerful hand ; for what God is in the heavens or in the earth that can do like to thy works , and like to thy might ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	25	Let me go over , I pray thee , and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan , that goodly mountain , and Lebanon .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	26	But Jehovah was wroth with me on your account , and did not hear me ; and Jehovah said to me , Let it suffice thee ; speak no more unto me of this matter !
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	27	Go up to the top of Pisgah , and lift up thine eyes westward , and northward , and southward , and eastward , and behold it with thine eyes ; for thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	28	But charge Joshua , and encourage him and strengthen him ; for he shall go over before this people , and he shall put them in possession of the land which thou shalt see .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	3	29	And we abode in the valley opposite to Beth-Peor .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	4	but ye that did cleave to Jehovah your God are alive every one of you this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	2	Ye shall not add to the word which I command you , neither shall ye take from it , that ye may keep the commandments of Jehovah your God which I command you .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	3	Your eyes have seen what Jehovah did because of Baal-Peor ; for all the men that followed Baal-Peor , Jehovah thy God hath destroyed them from among you ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	5	See , I have taught you statutes and ordinances , even as Jehovah my God commanded me , that ye may do so in the land into which ye enter to possess it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	6	And ye shall keep and do them ; for that will be your wisdom and your understanding before the eyes of the peoples that shall hear all these statutes , and say , Verily this great nation is a wise and understanding people .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	7	For what great nation is there that hath God near to them as Jehovah our God is in everything we call upon him for ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	8	And what great nation is there that hath righteous statutes and ordinances , as all this law which I set before you this day ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	9	Only take heed to thyself , and keep thy soul diligently , lest thou forget the things that thine eyes have seen ( and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life ; but thou shalt make them known to thy sons and to thy sons ' sons ) ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	10	the day that thou stoodest before Jehovah thy God in Horeb , when Jehovah said to me , Gather me the people together , that I may cause them to hear my words , that they may learn them , and fear me all the days that they live upon the earth , and teach them to their children .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	11	And ye came near and stood under the mountain ; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven , with darkness , clouds , and obscurity .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	12	And Jehovah spoke to you from the midst of the fire : ye heard the voice of the words , but ye saw no form ; only [ ye heard ] a voice .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	13	And he declared to you his covenant , which he commanded you to do , the ten words ; and he wrote them on two tables of stone .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	14	And Jehovah commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances , that ye might do them in the land whither ye are passing over to possess it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	15	And take great heed to your souls ( for ye saw no form on the day that Jehovah spoke to you in Horeb from the midst of the fire ) ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	16	lest ye corrupt yourselves , and make you a graven image , the form of any figure , the pattern of male or female ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	17	the pattern of any beast that is on the earth , the pattern of any winged fowl that flieth in the heaven ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	18	the pattern of anything that creepeth on the ground , the pattern of any fish that is in the waters under the earth ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	19	and lest thou lift up thine eyes to the heavens , and see the sun , and the moon , and the stars , the whole host of heaven , and be drawn away and bow down to them and serve them , which Jehovah thy God hath assigned unto all peoples under the whole heaven .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	20	But you hath Jehovah taken , and hath brought you forth out of the iron furnace , out of Egypt , that ye might be to him a people of inheritance , as it is this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	21	And Jehovah was angry with me on your account , and swore that I should not go over the Jordan , and that I should not enter in to that good land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee [ for ] an inheritance ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	22	for I shall die in this land , I shall not go over the Jordan ; but ye shall go over , and possess this good land .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	23	Take heed to yourselves lest ye forget the covenant of Jehovah your God , which he made with you , and make yourselves a graven image , the form of anything which Jehovah thy God hath forbidden thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	24	For Jehovah thy God is a consuming fire , a jealous God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	25	When thou begettest sons , and sons ' sons , and ye have remained long in the land , and shall corrupt yourselves , and make a graven image , the form of anything , and do evil in the sight of Jehovah thy God , to provoke him to anger ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	26	I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day , that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye pass over the Jordan to possess it : ye shall not prolong your days on it , but shall be utterly destroyed .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	27	And Jehovah will scatter you among the peoples , and ye shall be left a small company among the nations to which Jehovah will lead you .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	28	And ye shall there serve gods , the work of men 's hands , wood and stone , which neither see , nor hear , nor eat , nor smell .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	29	And from thence ye shall seek Jehovah thy God , and thou shalt find him , if thou shalt seek him with thy whole heart and with thy whole soul .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	30	In thy tribulation , and when all these things shall come upon thee , at the end of days , thou shalt return to Jehovah thy God , and shalt hearken to his voice ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	31	—for Jehovah thy God is a merciful God , —he will not forsake thee , neither destroy thee , nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he swore unto them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	32	For ask now of the days that are past , which were before thee , since the day that God created man on the earth , and from one end of the heavens to the other end of the heavens , whether there hath been anything as this great thing is , or if anything hath been heard like it ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	33	Did [ ever ] people hear the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire , as thou hast heard , and live ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	34	Or hath God essayed to come to take him a nation from the midst of a nation , by trials , by signs , and by wonders , and by war , and by a powerful hand , and by a stretched-out arm , and by great terrors , according to all that Jehovah your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	35	Unto thee it was shewn , that thou mightest know that Jehovah , he is God—there is none other besides him .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	36	From the heavens he made thee hear his voice , that he might instruct thee ; and on the earth he shewed thee his great fire ; and thou heardest his words from the midst of the fire .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	37	And because he loved thy fathers , and chose their seed after them , he brought thee out with his countenance , with his great power , out of Egypt ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	38	to dispossess nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art , to bring thee in , to give thee their land for an inheritance , as it is this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	39	Thou shalt know therefore this day , and consider it in thy heart , that Jehovah , he is God in the heavens above , and on the earth beneath : [ there is ] none else .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	40	And thou shalt keep his statutes , and his commandments , which I command thee this day , that it may be well with thee and with thy sons after thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy days on the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee , for ever .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	41	Then Moses separated three cities on this side the Jordan toward the sun-rising ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	42	that the manslayer might flee thither , who should kill his neighbour unawares , and hated him not previously , that fleeing to one of these cities , he might live :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	43	Bezer in the wilderness , in the plateau , of the Reubenites , and Ramoth in Gilead , of the Gadites , and Golan in Bashan , of the Manassites .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	44	And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	45	these are the testimonies , and the statutes , and the ordinances that Moses declared to the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	46	on this side the Jordan , in the valley opposite to Beth-Peor , in the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who dwelt in Heshbon , whom Moses and the children of Israel smote when they came out of Egypt ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	47	and they took possession of his land , and the land of Og the king of Bashan , two kings of the Amorites , who were on this side the Jordan , toward the sun-rising ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	48	from Aroer , which is on the bank of the river Arnon , as far as mount Sion , which is Hermon ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	4	49	and all the plain on this side the Jordan , eastward , and as far as the sea of the plain , under the slopes of Pisgah .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	5	( I stood between Jehovah and you at that time , to declare to you the word of Jehovah ; for ye were afraid by reason of the fire , and went not up to the mountain ) , saying ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	2	Jehovah our God made a covenant with us in Horeb .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	3	Not with our fathers did Jehovah make this covenant , but with us , [ even ] us , those [ who are ] here alive all of us this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	4	Face to face on the mountain from the midst of the fire Jehovah spoke with you
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	6	I am Jehovah thy God who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	7	Thou shalt have no other gods before me .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	8	Thou shalt not make thyself any graven image , any form of what is in the heavens above , or what is in the earth beneath , or what is in the waters under the earth :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	9	thou shalt not bow down thyself to them , nor serve them ; for I , Jehovah thy God , am a jealous God , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons , and upon the third and upon the fourth [ generation ] of them that hate me ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	10	and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	11	Thou shalt not idly utter the name of Jehovah thy God ; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that idly uttereth his name .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	12	Keep the sabbath day to hallow it , as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	13	Six days shalt thou labour , and do all thy work ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	14	but the seventh day is the sabbath of Jehovah thy God : thou shalt not do any work , thou , nor thy son , nor thy daughter , nor thy bondman , nor thy handmaid , nor thine ox , nor thine ass , nor any of thy cattle , nor thy sojourner that is within thy gates ; that thy bondman and thy handmaid may rest as well as thou .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	15	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt , and that Jehovah thy God brought thee out thence with a powerful hand and with a stretched-out arm ; therefore Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee to observe the sabbath day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	16	Honour thy father and thy mother , as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee ; that thy days may be prolonged , and that it may be well with thee in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	17	Thou shalt not kill .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	18	Neither shalt thou commit adultery .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	19	Neither shalt thou steal .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	20	Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	21	Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour 's wife , neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour 's house , his field , nor his bondman , nor his handmaid , his ox , nor his ass , nor anything that is thy neighbour 's .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	22	These words Jehovah spoke to all your congregation on the mountain from the midst of the fire , of the cloud , and of the obscurity , with a great voice , and he added no more ; and he wrote them on two tables of stone , and gave them to me .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	23	And it came to pass , when ye heard the voice from the midst of the darkness , and the mountain burned with fire , that ye came near to me , all the heads of your tribes , and your elders ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	24	and ye said , Behold , Jehovah our God has shewn us his glory and his greatness , and we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire : we have seen this day that God talks with man , and he lives .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	25	And now , why should we die ? for this great fire will consume us . If we hear the voice of Jehovah our God any more , we shall die .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	26	For who is there of all flesh , that has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire , as we , and has lived ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	27	Come thou near , and hear all that Jehovah our God will say ; and speak thou to us all that Jehovah our God will speak to thee ; and we will hear it , and do it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	28	And Jehovah heard the voice of your words , when ye spoke to me ; and Jehovah said unto me , I have heard the voice of the words of this people that have spoken to thee : they have well spoken all that they have spoken .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	29	Oh that there were such a heart in them , that they would fear me , and keep all my commandments continually , that it might be well with them and with their sons for ever !
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	30	Go , say unto them , Get you into your tents again .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	31	But as for thee , stand thou here by me , and I will speak unto thee all the commandments , and the statutes , and the ordinances , which thou shalt teach them , that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	32	Take heed then to do as Jehovah your God hath commanded you : turn not aside to the right hand or to the left .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	5	33	In all the way that Jehovah your God hath commanded you shall ye walk , that ye may live , and that it may be well with you , and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	6	And these words , which I command thee this day , shall be in thy heart ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	2	that thou mayest fear Jehovah thy God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments which I command thee , thou , and thy son , and thy son 's son , all the days of thy life ; and that thy days may be prolonged .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	3	And thou shalt hear , Israel , and take heed to do [ them ] ; that it may be well with thee , and that ye may increase greatly , as Jehovah the God of thy fathers hath said unto thee , in a land flowing with milk and honey .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	4	Hear , Israel : Jehovah our God is one Jehovah ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	5	and thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	7	and thou shalt impress them on thy sons , and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house , and when thou goest on the way , and when thou liest down , and when thou risest up .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	8	And thou shalt bind them for a sign on thy hand , and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	9	And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house , and upon thy gates .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	10	And it shall be , when Jehovah thy God bringeth thee into the land which he swore unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give thee : great and good cities which thou buildedst not ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	11	and houses full of everything good which thou filledst not , and wells digged which thou diggedst not , vineyards and oliveyards which thou plantedst not , and thou shalt have eaten and shalt be full ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	12	[ then ] beware lest thou forget Jehovah who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	13	Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God , and serve him , and shalt swear by his name .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	14	Ye shall not go after other gods , of the gods of the peoples that are round about you ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	15	for Jehovah thy God is a jealous God in thy midst ; lest the anger of Jehovah thy God be kindled against thee , and he destroy thee from the face of the earth .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	16	Ye shall not tempt Jehovah your God , as ye tempted him in Massah .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	17	Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of Jehovah your God , and his testimonies , and his statutes , which he hath commanded thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	18	And thou shalt do what is right and good in the sight of Jehovah , that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest enter in and possess the good land which Jehovah swore unto thy fathers ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	19	thrusting out all thine enemies from before thee , as Jehovah hath spoken .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	20	When thy son shall ask thee in time to come , saying , What are the testimonies , and the statutes , and the ordinances , which Jehovah our God hath commanded you ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	21	then thou shalt say unto thy son , We were Pharaoh 's bondmen in Egypt ; and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt with a powerful hand ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	22	and Jehovah shewed signs and wonders , great and grievous , upon Egypt , upon Pharaoh , and upon all his household , before our eyes ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	23	and he brought us out thence , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he swore unto our fathers .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	24	And Jehovah commanded us to do all these statutes , to fear Jehovah our God , for our good continually , that he might preserve us alive , as it is this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	6	25	And it shall be our righteousness if we take heed to do all these commandments before Jehovah our God , as he hath commanded us .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	7	Not because ye were more in number than all the peoples , hath Jehovah been attached to you and chosen you , for ye are the fewest of all the peoples ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	2	and when Jehovah thy God shall give them up before thee and thou shalt smite them , then shalt thou utterly destroy them : thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor shew mercy unto them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	3	And thou shalt make no marriages with them : thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son , nor take his daughter for thy son ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	4	for he will turn away thy son from following me , and they will serve other gods , and the anger of Jehovah will be kindled against you , and he will destroy thee quickly .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	5	But thus shall ye deal with them : ye shall break down their altars , and shatter their statues , and hew down their Asherahs , and burn their graven images with fire .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	6	For a holy people art thou unto Jehovah thy God : Jehovah thy God hath chosen thee to be unto him a people for a possession , above all the peoples that are upon the face of the earth .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	8	but because Jehovah loved you , and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers , hath Jehovah brought you out with a powerful hand , and redeemed you out of the house of bondage , from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	9	And thou shalt know that Jehovah thy God , he is God , the faithful God , who keepeth covenant and mercy to a thousand generations with them that love him and keep his commandments ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	10	and repayeth them that hate him [ each ] to his face , to cause them to perish : he delayeth not with him that hateth him , he will repay him to his face .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	11	And thou shalt keep the commandment , and the statutes , and the ordinances , which I command thee this day , to do them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	12	And it shall come to pass , if ye hearken to these ordinances , and keep and do them , that Jehovah thy God will keep with thee the covenant and the mercy which he swore unto thy fathers ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	13	and he will love thee , and bless thee , and multiply thee , and will bless the fruit of thy womb , and the fruit of thy ground , thy corn and thy new wine , and thine oil , the offspring of thy kine , and the increase of thy sheep , in the land which he swore unto thy fathers to give thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	14	Thou shalt be blessed above all the peoples ; there shall not be male or female barren with thee , or with thy cattle ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	15	and Jehovah will take away from thee all sickness , and none of the evil infirmities of Egypt , which thou knowest , will he put upon thee ; but he will lay them upon all them that hate thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	16	And thou shalt consume all the peoples that Jehovah thy God will give up unto thee ; thine eye shall not spare them , and thou shalt not serve their gods ; for that would be a snare unto thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	17	If thou shouldest say in thy heart , These nations are greater than I ; how can I dispossess them ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	18	fear them not ; remember well what Jehovah thy God did unto Pharaoh , and unto all the Egyptians ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	19	the great trials which thine eyes saw , and the signs , and the wonders , and the powerful hand , and the stretched-out arm , whereby Jehovah thy God brought thee out : so will Jehovah thy God do unto all the peoples whom thou fearest .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	20	Moreover , Jehovah thy God will send the hornet among them , until they that are left , and they that hide themselves from thee , are destroyed .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	21	Thou shalt not be afraid of them ; for Jehovah thy God is in thy midst , a God great and terrible .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	22	And Jehovah thy God will cast out those nations from before thee by little and little ; thou shalt not be able to make an end of them at once , lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	23	But Jehovah thy God will give them up before thee , and will confound them with great consternation , until they are destroyed .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	24	And he will give their kings into thy hand , and thou shalt put out their name from under the heavens ; no man shall stand before thee , until thou hast destroyed them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	25	The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire ; thou shalt not covet the silver and gold [ that is ] on them and take it unto thee , lest thou be ensnared therein ; for it is an abomination to Jehovah thy God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	7	26	And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house , lest thou be a cursed thing like it : thou shalt utterly detest it , and thou shalt utterly abhor it ; for it is a cursed thing .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	8	a land of wheat , and barley , and vines , and fig-trees , and pomegranates ; a land of olive-trees and honey ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	2	And thou shalt remember all the way which Jehovah thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness , to humble thee , and to prove thee , to know what was in thy heart , whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or not .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	3	And he humbled thee , and suffered thee to hunger , and fed thee with the manna , which thou hadst not known , and which thy fathers knew not ; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread alone , but by everything that goeth out of the mouth of Jehovah doth man live .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	4	Thy clothing grew not old upon thee , neither did thy foot swell , these forty years .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	5	And know in thy heart that , as a man chasteneth his son , so Jehovah thy God chasteneth thee ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	6	and thou shalt keep the commandments of Jehovah thy God , to walk in his ways , and to fear him .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	7	For Jehovah thy God bringeth thee into a good land , a land of water-brooks , of springs , and of deep waters , that gush forth in the valleys and hills ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	9	a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness , where thou shalt lack nothing ; a land whose stones are iron , and out of whose mountains thou wilt dig copper .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	10	And thou shalt eat and be filled , and shalt bless Jehovah thy God for the good land which he hath given thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	11	Beware that thou forget not Jehovah thy God , in not keeping his commandments , and his ordinances , and his statutes , which I command thee this day ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	12	lest when thou hast eaten and art full , and hast built and inhabited fine houses ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	13	and thy herds and thy flocks multiply , and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied , and all that thou hast is multiplied ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	14	then thy heart be lifted up , and thou forget Jehovah thy God , who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	15	who led thee through the great and terrible wilderness , [ a wilderness of ] fiery serpents , and scorpions , and drought , where there is no water ; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	16	who fed thee in the wilderness with manna , which thy fathers knew not , that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to do thee good at thy latter end ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	17	—and thou say in thy heart , My power and the might of my hand has procured me this wealth .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	18	But thou shalt remember Jehovah thy God , that it is he who giveth thee power to get wealth , that he may establish his covenant which he swore unto thy fathers , as it is this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	19	And it shall be , if thou do at all forget Jehovah thy God , and go after other gods , and serve them , and bow down to them , I testify against you this day that ye shall utterly perish .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	8	20	As the nations which Jehovah is causing to perish before you , so shall ye perish ; because ye would not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	9	when I went up the mountain to receive the tables of stone , the tables of the covenant which Jehovah made with you , and I abode in the mountain forty days and forty nights , —I ate no bread and drank no water , —
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	2	a people great and tall , the sons of the Anakim , whom thou knowest , and of whom thou hast heard [ say ] , Who can stand before the sons of Anak !
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	3	Know then this day , that Jehovah thy God is he that goeth over before thee , a consuming fire ; he will destroy them , and he will cast them down before thee , and thou shalt dispossess them and cause them to perish quickly , as Jehovah hath said unto thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	4	Thou shalt not say in thy heart , when Jehovah thy God thrusteth them out from before thee , saying , For my righteousness Jehovah hath brought me in to possess this land ; but for the wickedness of these nations doth Jehovah dispossess them from before thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	5	Not for thy righteousness , or for the uprightness of thy heart , dost thou enter in to possess their land , but for the wickedness of these nations doth Jehovah thy God dispossess them from before thee , and that he may perform the word which Jehovah swore unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	6	Know therefore that Jehovah thy God doth not give thee this good land to possess it for thy righteousness ; for thou art a stiff-necked people .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	7	Remember , forget not , how thou provokedst Jehovah thy God to wrath in the wilderness . From the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt , until ye came to this place , ye have been rebellious against Jehovah .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	8	And at Horeb ye provoked Jehovah to wrath , and Jehovah was angry with you , to destroy you ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	10	—and Jehovah delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God ; and on them [ was written ] according to all the words which Jehovah spoke with you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	11	And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights , that Jehovah gave me the two tables of stone , the tables of the covenant .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	12	And Jehovah said unto me , Arise , go down quickly from hence ; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves ; they have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them : they have made for themselves a molten image .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	13	And Jehovah spoke unto me , saying , I have seen this people , and behold , it is a stiff-necked people .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	14	Let me alone , that I may destroy them , and blot out their name from under heaven ; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	15	And I turned and came down from the mountain , and the mountain burned with fire ; and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	16	And I saw , and behold , ye had sinned against Jehovah your God : ye had made for yourselves a molten calf ; ye had quickly turned aside from the way which Jehovah had commanded you .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	17	And I seized the two tables , and cast them out of my two hands , and broke them before your eyes .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	18	And I fell down before Jehovah , as at the first , forty days and forty nights , —I ate no bread and drank no water , —because of all your sin which ye had sinned , in doing what is evil in the eyes of Jehovah , to provoke him to anger .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	19	For I was afraid of the anger and fury wherewith Jehovah was wroth against you to destroy you . And Jehovah listened unto me also at that time .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	20	And with Aaron Jehovah was very angry to destroy him ; and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	21	And I took your sin , the calf which ye had made , and burned it with fire , and crushed it , and ground it very small , until it became fine dust ; and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that flowed down from the mountain .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	22	And at Taberah , and at Massah , and at Kibroth-hattaavah , ye provoked Jehovah to wrath .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	23	And when Jehovah sent you from Kadesh-barnea , saying , Go up and take possession of the land which I have given you , ye rebelled against the word of Jehovah your God , and ye believed him not , nor hearkened to his voice .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	24	Ye have been rebellious against Jehovah from the day that I knew you .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	25	So I fell down before Jehovah the forty days and forty nights , as I fell down ; for Jehovah had said he would destroy you .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	26	I prayed therefore to Jehovah , and said , Lord Jehovah , destroy not thy people and thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness , which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a powerful hand .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	27	Remember thy servants Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; look not at the stubbornness of this people , nor at their wickedness , nor at their sin ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	28	lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say , Because Jehovah was not able to bring them into the land which he had promised them , and because he hated them , he hath brought them out to kill them in the wilderness .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	9	29	They are indeed thy people and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest out with thy great power and with thy stretched-out arm .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	10	But I stood upon the mountain according to the former days , forty days and forty nights ; and Jehovah listened unto me also at that time : Jehovah would not destroy thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	2	and I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou didst break , and thou shalt lay them in the ark .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	3	And I made an ark of acacia-wood , and hewed two tables of stone like the first , and went up the mountain with the two tables in my hand .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	4	And he wrote on the tables , as the first writing , the ten words which Jehovah spoke unto you on the mountain , from the midst of the fire , on the day of the assembly , and Jehovah gave them unto me .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	5	And I turned and came down from the mountain , and put the tables in the ark which I had made ; —and they are there , as Jehovah commanded me .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	6	( And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth-Bene-Jaakan to Moserah : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son exercised the priesthood in his stead .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	7	From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah ; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah , a land of water-brooks . )
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	8	At that time Jehovah separated the tribe of Levi , to bear the ark of the covenant of Jehovah , to stand before Jehovah to do service unto him , and to bless in his name , unto this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	9	Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brethren ; Jehovah is his inheritance , according as Jehovah thy God told him .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	11	And Jehovah said unto me , Rise up , take thy journey before the people , that they may enter in and possess the land , which I swore unto their fathers to give unto them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	12	And now , Israel , what doth Jehovah thy God require of thee , but to fear Jehovah thy God , to walk in all his ways , and to love him , and to serve Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	13	to keep the commandments of Jehovah , and his statutes , which I command thee this day , for thy good ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	14	Behold , the heaven and the heaven of heavens belong to Jehovah thy God ; the earth and all that is therein .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	15	Only , Jehovah took pleasure in thy fathers , to love them , and he chose their seed after them , [ even ] you , out of all the peoples , as it is this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	16	Circumcise then the foreskin of your heart , and stiffen your neck no more .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	17	For Jehovah your God is the God of gods , and the Lord of lords , the great God , the mighty and the terrible , who regardeth not persons , nor taketh reward ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	18	who executeth the judgment of the fatherless and the widow , and loveth the stranger , to give him food and clothing .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	19	And ye shall love the stranger ; for ye have been strangers in the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	20	Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God ; him thou shalt serve , and unto him shalt thou cleave , and swear by his name .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	21	He is thy praise , and he is thy God , who hath done for thee these great and terrible things , which thine eyes have seen .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	10	22	With seventy souls thy fathers went down into Egypt ; and now Jehovah thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	11	but the land , whereunto ye are passing over to possess it , is a land of mountains and valleys , which drinketh water of the rain of heaven ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	2	And know ye this day … ; for [ I speak ] not with your children who have not known , and who have not seen the chastisement of Jehovah your God , his greatness , his powerful hand , and his stretched-out arm ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	3	and his signs and his acts which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and unto all his land ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	4	and what he did unto the army of Egypt , unto their horses , and unto their chariots , over which he made the water of the Red sea flow as they pursued after you , and Jehovah destroyed them unto this day ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	5	—and what he did unto you in the wilderness , until ye came to this place ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	6	and what he did unto Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab , the son of Reuben , —how the earth opened its mouth , and swallowed them up , with their households , and their tents , and all the living substance that belonged to them , in the midst of all Israel .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	7	For your eyes have seen all the great work of Jehovah which he hath done .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	8	Keep then all the commandment which I command you this day , that ye may be strong , and enter in and possess the land , whither ye pass over to possess it ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	9	and that ye may prolong your days in the land which Jehovah swore unto your fathers to give unto them and unto their seed , a land flowing with milk and honey .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	10	For the land , whither thou enterest in to possess it , is not as the land of Egypt , from whence ye came out , where thou sowedst thy seed , and wateredst it with thy foot , as a garden of herbs ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	12	a land which Jehovah thy God careth for ; the eyes of Jehovah thy God are constantly upon it , from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	13	And it shall come to pass , if ye hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day , to love Jehovah your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	14	that I will give rain to your land in its season , the early rain and the latter rain ; and thou shalt gather in thy corn , and thy new wine , and thine oil ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	15	and I will give grass in thy field for thy cattle ; and thou shalt eat and be full .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	16	Take heed to yourselves , that your heart be not deceived , and ye turn aside and serve other gods , and bow down to them ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	17	and Jehovah 's wrath kindle against you , and he shut up the heavens , that there be no rain , and that the ground yield not its produce , and ye perish quickly from off the good land which Jehovah is giving you .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	18	And ye shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul , and bind them for a sign upon your hand , and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	19	And ye shall teach them unto your children , speaking of them when thou sittest in thy house , and when thou goest on the way , and when thou liest down , and when thou risest up ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	20	and write them upon the posts of thy house , and upon thy gates ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	21	that your days may be multiplied , and the days of your children , in the land which Jehovah swore unto your fathers to give them , as the days of the heavens [ which are ] above the earth .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	22	For if ye diligently keep all this commandment which I command you [ this day ] to do it , to love Jehovah your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cleave unto him ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	23	then will Jehovah dispossess all these nations from before you , and ye shall take possession of nations greater and mightier than yourselves .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	24	Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours ; from the wilderness and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates , even unto the hinder sea shall your border be .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	25	No man shall be able to stand before you : the fear of you and the dread of you will Jehovah your God lay upon all the land that ye shall tread upon , as he hath said unto you .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	26	See , I set before you this day a blessing and a curse :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	27	a blessing , if ye obey the commandments of Jehovah your God , which I command you this day ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	28	and a curse , if ye will not obey the commandments of Jehovah your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods which ye have not known .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	29	And it shall come to pass , when Jehovah thy God hath brought thee into the land whither thou enterest in to possess it , that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim , and the curse upon mount Ebal .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	30	Are they not on the other side of the Jordan , beyond the way toward the going down of the sun , in the land of the Canaanites that dwell on the plain opposite to Gilgal , beside the oaks of Moreh ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	31	For ye pass over the Jordan to enter in to possess the land which Jehovah your God giveth you , and ye shall take possession of it , and dwell therein .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	11	32	And ye shall take heed to do all the statutes and ordinances which I set before you this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	12	And ye shall rejoice before Jehovah your God , ye , and your sons , and your daughters , and your bondmen , and your handmaids , and the Levite that is within your gates ; for he hath no portion nor inheritance with you .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	2	Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall dispossess have served their gods , upon the high mountains , and upon the hills , and under every green tree ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	3	and ye shall break down their altars , and shatter their statues , and burn their Asherahs with fire ; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods , and ye shall destroy the names of them out of that place .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	4	Ye shall not do so unto Jehovah your God ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	5	but unto the place which Jehovah your God will choose out of all your tribes to set his name there , his habitation shall ye seek , and thither thou shalt come ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	6	and thither ye shall bring your burnt-offerings and your sacrifices , and your tithes , and the heave-offering of your hand , and your vows , and your voluntary-offerings , and the firstlings of your kine and of your sheep ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	7	and ye shall eat there before Jehovah your God , and ye shall rejoice , ye and your households , in all the business of your hand , wherein Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	8	Ye shall not do after all that we do here this day , each one whatever is right in his own eyes .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	9	For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which Jehovah thy God giveth thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	10	But when ye have gone over the Jordan , and dwell in the land which Jehovah your God causeth you to inherit , and when he hath given you rest from all your enemies round about , and ye dwell in safety ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	11	then there shall be a place which Jehovah your God will choose to cause his name to dwell there ; thither shall ye bring all that I command you : your burnt-offerings , and your sacrifices , your tithes , and the heave-offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which ye shall vow to Jehovah .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	13	Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	14	but in the place which Jehovah will choose in one of thy tribes , there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings , and there thou shalt do all that I command thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	15	Nevertheless , according to all the desire of thy soul thou mayest slay and eat flesh in all thy gates , according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he hath given thee : the unclean and the clean may eat thereof , as of the gazelle , and the hart .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	16	Only , ye shall not eat the blood ; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	17	Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn , or of thy new wine , or of thine oil , or the firstlings of thy kine or of thy sheep , nor any of thy vows which thou vowest , nor thy voluntary-offerings , nor the heave-offering of thy hand ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	18	but before Jehovah thy God shalt thou eat them in the place which Jehovah thy God will choose , thou and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy bondman , and thy handmaid , and the Levite that is within thy gates ; and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God in all the business of thy hand .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	19	Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite all the days thou shalt be in thy land .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	20	When Jehovah thy God shall enlarge thy border , as he promised thee , and thou say , I will eat flesh , because thy soul longeth to eat flesh , thou mayest eat flesh , according to all the desire of thy soul .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	21	If the place which Jehovah thy God will choose to set his name there be too far from thee , then thou shalt slay of thy kine and of thy sheep which Jehovah hath given thee , as I have commanded thee , and thou shalt eat in thy gates according to all the desire of thy soul .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	22	Even as the gazelle and the hart is eaten , so thou shalt eat them : the unclean and the clean alike may eat of them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	23	Only , be sure that thou eat not the blood ; for the blood is the life , and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	24	thou shalt not eat it ; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	25	thou shalt not eat it ; that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee , when thou shalt do what is right in the eyes of Jehovah .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	26	But thy hallowed things which thou hast , and what thou hast vowed , thou shalt take , and come to the place which Jehovah will choose ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	27	and thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings , the flesh and the blood , upon the altar of Jehovah thy God ; and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of Jehovah thy God , and the flesh shalt thou eat .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	28	Take heed to hear all these words which I command thee , that it may be well with thee , and with thy children after thee for ever , when thou doest what is good and right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	29	When Jehovah thy God cutteth off from before thee the nations whither thou goest , to take possession of them , and thou hast dispossessed them , and dwellest in their land ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	30	take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared [ to follow ] after them , after that they are destroyed from before thee ; and that thou inquire not after their gods , saying , How did these nations serve their gods ? even so will I do likewise .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	31	Thou shalt not do so to Jehovah thy God ; for every [ thing that is ] abomination to Jehovah , which he hateth , have they done unto their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters have they burned in the fire to their gods .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	12	32	Everything that I command you , ye shall take heed to do it ; thou shalt not add thereto , nor take from it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	13	There are men , children of Belial , gone out from among you , and they have drawn away the inhabitants of their city , saying , Let us go and serve other gods , whom ye have not known ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	2	and the sign or the wonder come to pass that he told unto thee , when he said , Let us go after other gods , whom thou hast not known , and let us serve them ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	3	—thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet , or that dreamer of dreams ; for Jehovah your God proveth you , to know whether ye love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	4	Ye shall walk after Jehovah your God , and ye shall fear him , and his commandments shall ye keep , and his voice shall ye hear ; and ye shall serve him , and unto him shall ye cleave .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	5	And that prophet , or that dreamer of dreams , shall be put to death ; for he hath spoken revolt against Jehovah your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt , and redeemed you out of the house of bondage , —to draw thee out of the way that Jehovah thy God commanded thee to walk in ; and thou shalt put evil away from thy midst .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	6	If thy brother , the son of thy mother , or thy son , or thy daughter , or the wife of thy bosom , or thy friend , who is to thee as thy soul , entice thee secretly , saying , Let us go and serve other gods ( whom thou hast not known , thou , nor thy fathers ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	7	of the gods of the peoples which are round about you , near unto thee , or far from thee , from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth ) ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	8	thou shalt not consent unto him , nor hearken unto him ; neither shall thine eye spare him , neither shalt thou pity him , neither shalt thou screen him ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	9	but thou shalt in any case kill him : thy hand shall be the first against him to put him to death , and afterwards the hands of all the people ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	10	and thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die ; for he hath sought to draw thee away from Jehovah thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	11	and all Israel shall hear , and fear , and shall do no more any such wicked thing as this in thy midst .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	12	If in one of thy cities , which Jehovah thy God hath given thee to dwell there , thou hearest , saying ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	14	then shalt thou inquire , and make search , and ask diligently ; and if it be truth , [ and ] the thing be certain , that this abomination hath happened in the midst of thee ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	15	thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , devoting it to destruction , and all that is therein , and the cattle thereof , with the edge of the sword .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	16	And all the spoil of it shalt thou gather into the midst of the open place thereof , and shalt burn the city with fire , and all the spoil thereof , wholly to Jehovah thy God ; and it shall be a heap for ever ; it shall not be built again .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	17	And thou shalt not let anything cleave to thy hand of the devoted thing ; that Jehovah may turn from the fierceness of his anger , and shew thee mercy , and have compassion upon thee , and multiply thee , as he hath sworn unto thy fathers ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	13	18	when thou hearkenest to the voice of Jehovah thy God , to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day , that thou mayest do what is right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	14	and every raven after its kind ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	2	For thou art a holy people unto Jehovah thy God , and thee hath Jehovah chosen for a people of possession unto himself , out of all the peoples that are upon the face of the earth .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	3	Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	4	These are the beasts which ye shall eat : the ox , the sheep , and the goat ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	5	the hart , and the gazelle , and the stag , and the wild goat , and the dishon and the oryx , and the wild sheep .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	6	And every beast that hath cloven hoofs , and the feet quite split open into double hoofs , [ and ] which cheweth the cud , among the beasts , that ye shall eat .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	7	Only these ye shall not eat of those that chew the cud , or of those with hoofs cloven and split open : the camel , and the hare , and the rock-badger ; for they chew the cud , but have not cloven hoofs—they shall be unclean unto you ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	8	and the swine , for it hath cloven hoofs , yet cheweth not the cud—it shall be unclean unto you . Of their flesh shall ye not eat , and their carcase shall ye not touch .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	9	These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters : whatsoever hath fins and scales shall ye eat ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	10	but whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye shall not eat : it shall be unclean unto you .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	11	All clean birds shall ye eat .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	12	But these are they of which ye shall not eat : the eagle , and the ossifrage , and the sea-eagle ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	13	and the falcon , and the kite , and the black kite after its kind ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	15	and the female ostrich , and the male ostrich , and the sea-gull , and the hawk after its kind ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	16	the owl , and the ibis and the swan ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	17	and the pelican , and the carrion vulture , and the gannet ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	18	and the stork , and the heron after its kind , and the hoopoe , and the bat .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	19	And every winged crawling thing shall be unclean unto you ; they shall not be eaten .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	20	All clean fowls shall ye eat .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	21	Ye shall eat of no carcase ; thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is within thy gates , that he may eat it , or sell it unto a foreigner ; for thou art a holy people to Jehovah thy God . Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother 's milk .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	22	Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed , the produce of the field , year by year .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	23	And thou shalt eat before Jehovah thy God , in the place which he will choose to cause his name to dwell there , the tithe of thy corn , of thy new wine , and of thine oil , and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks ; that thou mayest learn to fear Jehovah thy God continually .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	24	And if the way be too long for thee , so that thou art not able to carry it , because the place is too far from thee , which Jehovah thy God will choose to set his name there , when Jehovah thy God blesseth thee ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	25	then shalt thou give it for money , and bind the money together in thy hand , and go to the place which Jehovah thy God will choose ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	26	and thou shalt give the money for whatever thy soul desireth , for oxen , or for sheep , or for wine , or for strong drink , or for whatever thy soul asketh of thee ; and thou shalt eat there before Jehovah thy God , and thou shalt rejoice , thou , and thy house .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	27	And thou shalt not forsake the Levite that is within thy gates ; for he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	28	At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year , and shalt lay it up within thy gates ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	14	29	and the Levite—for he hath no portion nor inheritance with thee—and the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , that are within thy gates , shall come , and shall eat and be satisfied ; that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou doest .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	15	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt , and that Jehovah thy God redeemed thee ; therefore I command thee this thing to-day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	2	and this is the manner of the release : Every creditor shall relax his hand from the loan which he hath lent unto his neighbour ; he shall not demand it of his neighbour , or of his brother ; for a release to Jehovah hath been proclaimed .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	3	Of the foreigner thou mayest demand it ; but what is thine with thy brother thy hand shall release ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	4	save when there shall be no one in need among you ; for Jehovah will greatly bless thee in the land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	5	if thou only diligently hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God , to take heed to do all this commandment which I command thee this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	6	For Jehovah thy God will bless thee , as he promised thee ; and thou shalt lend on pledge to many nations , but thou shalt not borrow ; and thou shalt rule over many nations , but they shall not rule over thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	7	If there be amongst you a poor man , any one of thy brethren in one of thy gates , in thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee , thou shalt not harden thy heart , nor shut thy hand from thy brother in need ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	8	but thou shalt open thy hand bountifully unto him , and shalt certainly lend him on pledge what is sufficient for his need , [ in that ] which he lacketh .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	9	Beware that there be not a wicked thought in thy heart , saying , The seventh year , the year of release , is at hand ; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother , and thou givest him nought ; and he cry against thee to Jehovah , and it be sin in thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	10	Thou shalt bountifully give unto him , and thy heart shall not be evil-disposed when thou givest unto him ; because for this thing Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all thy works , and in all the business of thy hand .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	11	For the needy shall never cease from within the land ; therefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt open thy hand bountifully unto thy brother , to thy poor and to thy needy , in thy land .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	12	If thy brother , a Hebrew man , or a Hebrew woman , have been sold unto thee , he shall serve thee six years , and in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	13	And when thou sendest him out free from thee , thou shalt not let him go away empty ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	14	thou shalt certainly furnish him from thy sheep , and out of thy floor , and out of thy winepress : of what Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee with shalt thou give unto him .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	16	And it shall be , if he say unto thee , I will not go away from thee , —because he loveth thee and thy house , because he is well with thee , —
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	17	then thou shalt take an awl , and thrust it through his ear and into the door ; and he shall be thy bondman for ever . And also unto thy handmaid thou shalt do likewise .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	18	Let it not seem hard unto thee , when thou sendest him away free from thee ; for double the worth of a hired servant hath he been to thee , [ in ] serving thee six years ; and Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all that thou doest .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	19	Every firstling that is born among thy kine and among thy sheep that is a male , thou shalt hallow to Jehovah thy God : thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy kine , nor shear the firstling of thy sheep .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	20	Thou shalt eat it before Jehovah thy God , year by year , in the place which Jehovah will choose , thou and thy household .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	21	But if there be a defect therein , [ if it be ] lame , or blind , [ or have ] any evil defect , thou shalt not sacrifice it to Jehovah thy God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	22	In thy gates shalt thou eat it ; the unclean and the clean [ shall eat it ] alike , as the gazelle and as the hart .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	15	23	Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof : thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	16	Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before Jehovah thy God in the place which he will choose , at the feast of unleavened bread , and at the feast of weeks , and at the feast of tabernacles ; and they shall not appear before Jehovah empty :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	2	And thou shalt sacrifice the passover to Jehovah thy God , of the flock and of the herd , in the place which Jehovah will choose to cause his name to dwell there .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	3	Thou shalt eat no leavened bread along with it ; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread with it , bread of affliction ; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste , —that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt , all the days of thy life .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	4	And there shall be no leaven seen with thee in all thy borders seven days ; neither shall any of the flesh , which thou sacrificedst at even on the first day , be left over night until the morning.—
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	5	Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover in one of thy gates , which Jehovah thy God giveth thee ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	6	but at the place that Jehovah thy God will choose , to cause his name to dwell in , there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even , at the going down of the sun , at the time that thou camest forth out of Egypt .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	7	And thou shalt cook and eat it at the place which Jehovah thy God will choose ; and in the morning shalt thou turn and go unto thy tents .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	8	Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , and on the seventh day is a solemn assembly to Jehovah thy God ; thou shalt do no work .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	9	Seven weeks shalt thou count : from the beginning of putting the sickle into the corn shalt thou begin to count seven weeks .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	10	And thou shalt hold the feast of weeks to Jehovah thy God with a tribute of a voluntary-offering of thy hand , which thou shalt give , according as Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	11	and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy bondman , and thy handmaid , and the Levite that is in thy gates , and the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow that are in thy midst in the place that Jehovah thy God will choose to cause his name to dwell there .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	12	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt , and thou shalt keep and do these statutes .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	13	The feast of tabernacles shalt thou hold seven days , when thou hast gathered in [ the produce ] of thy floor and of thy winepress .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	14	And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy bondman , and thy handmaid , and the Levite , and the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , that are in thy gates .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	15	Seven days shalt thou hold a feast to Jehovah thy God in the place which Jehovah will choose ; for Jehovah thy God will bless thee in all thy produce , and in all the work of thy hands , and thou shalt be wholly joyful .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	17	each [ shall give ] according to that which is in his power to give , according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he hath given thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	18	Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates , which Jehovah thy God giveth thee , throughout thy tribes , that they may judge the people with just judgment .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	19	Thou shalt not wrest judgment ; thou shalt not respect persons , neither take a bribe ; for the bribe blindeth the eyes of the wise , and perverteth the words of the righteous .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	20	Perfect justice shalt thou follow , that thou mayest live , and possess the land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	21	Thou shalt not plant thyself an Asherah of any wood near unto the altar of Jehovah thy God , which thou shalt make thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	16	22	Neither shalt thou set thee up a statue , which Jehovah thy God hateth .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	17	Neither shall he multiply wives to himself , that his heart turn not away ; neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	2	If there be found in thy midst in any of thy gates which Jehovah thy God giveth thee , man or woman , that doeth what is evil in the sight of Jehovah thy God , in transgressing his covenant ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	3	and goeth and serveth other gods , and boweth down to them , either to the sun or to the moon , or to the whole host of heaven , which I have not commanded ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	4	and it be told thee , and thou hearest of it ; then thou shalt make thorough inquiry , and if it be truth [ and ] the thing be certain , that this abomination hath been wrought in Israel ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	5	thou shalt bring forth that man or that woman , who committed that wicked thing , unto thy gates , the man or the woman , and shalt stone them with stones , that they die .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	6	At the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he that is to die be put to death : he shall not be put to death at the mouth of one witness .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	7	The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterwards the hands of all the people ; and thou shalt put evil away from thy midst .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	8	If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment , between blood and blood , between cause and cause , and between stroke and stroke , matters of controversy within thy gates , then shalt thou arise , and go up to the place which Jehovah thy God will choose .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	9	And thou shalt come unto the priests , the Levites , and unto the judge that shall be in those days , and inquire ; and they shall declare unto thee the sentence of judgment ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	10	and thou shalt do according to the tenor of the word , which they of that place which Jehovah will choose shall declare unto thee ; and thou shalt take heed to do according to all that they instruct thee :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	11	according to the sentence of the law which they shall declare unto thee , and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee , thou shalt do : thou shalt not decline from the word which they shall declare unto thee , to the right hand , or the left .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	12	And the man that shall act presumptuously , and not hearken unto the priest that standeth to serve there before Jehovah thy God , or unto the judge , that man shall die ; and thou shalt put away evil from Israel .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	13	And all the people shall hear , and fear , and no more act presumptuously .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	14	When thou comest unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee , and shalt possess it , and shalt dwell therein , and shalt say , I will set a king over me , like all the nations that are about me ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	15	thou shalt only set him king over thee whom Jehovah thy God will choose : from among thy brethren shalt thou set a king over thee ; thou mayest not set a foreigner over thee , who is not thy brother .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	16	Only he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor lead back the people to Egypt , to multiply horses ; for Jehovah hath said unto you , Ye shall not return again any more that way .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	18	And it shall be , when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom , that he shall write for himself a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests , the Levites ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	19	and it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life ; that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	17	20	that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren , and that he turn not aside from the commandment , to the right hand , or to the left ; that he may prolong his days in his kingdom , he , and his sons , in the midst of Israel .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	18	A prophet will I raise up unto them from among their brethren , like unto thee , and will put my words in his mouth , and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	2	but they shall have no inheritance among their brethren : Jehovah , he is their inheritance , as he hath said unto them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	3	And this shall be the priest 's due from the people , from them that sacrifice a sacrifice , whether ox , or sheep : they shall give unto the priest the shoulder , and the jawbones , and the maw .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	4	The firstfruits [ also ] of thy corn , of thy new wine , and of thine oil , and the firstfruits of the shearing of thy sheep , shalt thou give him ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	5	for Jehovah thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes , that he may stand to serve in the name of Jehovah , he and his sons continually .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	6	And if the Levite shall come from one of thy gates out of all Israel , where he sojourneth , and shall come according to all the desire of his soul unto the place which Jehovah will choose ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	7	and shall serve in the name of Jehovah his God , as all his brethren the Levites that stand there before Jehovah ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	8	—they shall have like portions to eat , besides that which he hath sold of his patrimony .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	9	When thou art come into the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee , thou shalt not learn to do according to the abominations of those nations .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	10	There shall not be found among you he that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire , that useth divination , that useth auguries , or an enchanter , or a sorcerer ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	11	or a charmer , or one that inquireth of a spirit of Python , or a soothsayer , or one that consulteth the dead .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	12	For every one that doeth these things is an abomination to Jehovah , and because of these abominations Jehovah thy God doth dispossess them from before thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	13	Thou shalt be perfect with Jehovah thy God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	14	For these nations , which thou shalt dispossess , hearkened unto those that use auguries , and that use divination ; but as for thee , Jehovah thy God hath not suffered thee [ to do ] so .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	15	Jehovah thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee , of thy brethren , like unto me ; unto him shall ye hearken ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	16	according to all that thou desiredst of Jehovah thy God at Horeb on the day of the assembly , saying , Let me not hear again the voice of Jehovah my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I die not .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	17	And Jehovah said unto me , They have well spoken that which they have spoken .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	19	And it shall come to pass that the man who hearkeneth not unto my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	20	But the prophet who shall presume to speak a word in my name that I have not commanded him to speak , or that shall speak in the name of other gods , that prophet shall die .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	21	And if thou say in thy heart , How shall we know the word that Jehovah hath not spoken ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	18	22	When a prophet speaketh in the name of Jehovah , and the thing followeth not , nor cometh to pass , that is the word which Jehovah hath not spoken ; the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously : be not afraid of him .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	19	then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brother ; and thou shalt put evil away from thy midst .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	2	thou shalt separate three cities for thyself in the midst of thy land , which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	3	Thou shalt prepare thee the way , and divide the territory of thy land , which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to inherit , into three parts , so that every slayer may flee thither .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	4	And this is the case of the slayer who shall flee thither that he may live : he that smiteth his neighbour unwittingly , whom he hated not previously ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	5	as when he goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood , and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree , and the iron slippeth from the handle , and lighteth upon his neighbour , that he die ; such an one shall flee unto one of these cities , and live ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	6	lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer , while his heart is hot , and overtake him , because the way is long , and smite him mortally ; whereas he was not worthy of death , since he hated him not previously .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	7	Therefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt separate three cities for thyself .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	8	And if Jehovah thy God enlarge thy border , as he hath sworn unto thy fathers , and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	9	( if thou keep all this commandment to do it , which I command thee this day , to love Jehovah thy God , and to walk in his ways continually ) , then shalt thou add three cities more for thyself to these three ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	10	that innocent blood be not shed in the midst of thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance , and blood come not upon thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	11	But if a man hate his neighbour , and lie in wait for him , and rise up against him , and smite him mortally that he die , and he flee into one of these cities ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	12	then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence , and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood , that he may die .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	13	Thine eye shall not spare him ; and thou shalt put away innocent blood from Israel , that it may be well with thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	14	Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour 's landmark , which they of old time have fixed in thine inheritance , which thou shalt inherit in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	15	One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity , and for any sin , in any sin that he sinneth : at the mouth of two witnesses , or at the mouth of three witnesses , shall a matter be established .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	16	If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify against him of an offence ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	17	then both the men between whom the controversy is shall stand before Jehovah , before the priests and the judges that shall be in those days ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	18	and the judges shall make thorough inquiry ; and if the witness be a false witness , and he have testified falsely against his brother ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	20	And those that remain shall hear , and fear , and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil in thy midst .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	19	21	And thine eye shall not spare : life for life , eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	20	Only the trees which thou knowest are not trees for meat , thou mayest destroy and cut them down , and build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee , until it fall .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	2	And it shall be , when ye approach unto the battle , that the priest shall draw near and speak unto the people ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	3	and shall say unto them , Hear , Israel , ye are approaching this day unto battle against your enemies : let not your hearts faint , fear not , and do not tremble , neither be afraid of them ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	4	for Jehovah your God is he that goeth with you , to fight for you against your enemies , to save you .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	5	And the officers shall speak unto the people , saying , What man is there that hath built a new house , and hath not dedicated it ? let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedicate it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	6	And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard , and hath not eaten of it ? let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	7	And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife , and hath not taken her ? let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	8	And the officers shall speak further unto the people , and shall say , What man is there that is timid and faint-hearted ? let him go and return unto his house , lest his brethren 's heart melt as well as his heart .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	9	And it shall be , when the officers have ended speaking unto the people , that they shall place captains of the hosts at the head of the people .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	10	When thou approachest unto a city to fight against it , thou shalt proclaim peace unto it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	11	And it shall be , if it make thee answer of peace , and open unto thee , then all the people that are found therein shall be tributaries unto thee , and they shall serve thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	12	And if it will not make peace with thee , but will make war with thee , then thou shalt besiege it ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	13	and when Jehovah thy God delivereth it into thy hand , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	14	only the women , and the little ones , and the cattle , and all that shall be in the city , all the spoil thereof , shalt thou take as booty for thyself ; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies , which Jehovah thy God giveth thee
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	15	Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities that are very far off from thee , which are not of the cities of these nations .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	16	But of the cities of these peoples which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance , thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	17	but shalt utterly devote them to destruction , the Hittites and the Amorites , the Canaanites and the Perizzites , the Hivites and the Jebusites , as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	18	that they teach you not to do according to all their abominations , which they have done unto their gods , so that ye sin against Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	20	19	When thou shalt besiege a city many days , in making war against it to take it , thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by lifting up an axe against them ; for thou canst eat of them ; and thou shalt not cut them down , for is the tree of the field a man that it should be besieged ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	21	And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones , that he die . And thou shalt put evil away from thy midst ; and all Israel shall hear and fear .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	2	then thine elders and thy judges shall go forth , and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	3	and the city that is nearest unto him that is slain , even the elders of that city shall take a heifer that hath not been wrought with , that hath not drawn in the yoke ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	4	and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto an ever-flowing watercourse , which is not tilled , nor is it sown , and shall break the heifer 's neck there in the watercourse ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	5	and the priests the sons of Levi shall come near ; for them Jehovah thy God hath chosen to do service unto him , and to bless in the name of Jehovah ; and according to their word shall be every controversy and every stroke .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	6	And all the elders of that city , that are nearest unto him that is slain , shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck is broken in the watercourse ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	7	and shall answer and say , Our hands have not shed this blood , neither have our eyes seen it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	8	Forgive thy people Israel , whom thou , Jehovah , hast redeemed , and lay not innocent blood to the charge of thy people Israel ; and the blood shall be expiated for them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	9	So shalt thou put away innocent blood from thy midst , when thou shalt do what is right in the eyes of Jehovah .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	10	When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies , and Jehovah thy God delivereth them into thy hands , and thou hast taken captives of them ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	11	and thou seest among the captives a woman of beautiful form , and hast a desire unto her , and takest her as thy wife ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	12	then thou shalt bring her home to thy house ; and she shall shave her head , and pare her nails ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	13	and she shall put the clothes of her captivity from off her , and shall abide in thy house , and bewail her father and mother a full month , and afterwards thou mayest go in unto her , and be her husband , and she shall be thy wife .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	14	And it shall be , if thou have no delight in her , then thou shalt let her go according to her desire ; but thou shalt in no wise sell her for money ; thou shalt not treat her as a slave , because thou hast humbled her .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	15	If a man have two wives , one beloved , and one hated , and they have borne him children , both the beloved and the hated , and the firstborn son be hers that was hated ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	16	then it shall be , in the day that he maketh his sons to inherit what he hath , that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated , who is the firstborn ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	17	but he shall acknowledge as firstborn the son of the hated , by giving him a double portion of all that is found with him ; for he is the firstfruits of his vigour : the right of the firstborn is his .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	18	If a man have an unmanageable and rebellious son , who hearkeneth not unto the voice of his father , nor unto the voice of his mother , and they have chastened him , but he hearkeneth not unto them ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	19	then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out unto the elders of his city , and unto the gate of his place ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	20	and they shall say unto the elders of his city , This our son is unmanageable and rebellious , he hearkeneth not unto our voice ; he is a profligate and a drunkard .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	22	And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death , and he be put to death , and thou have hanged him on a tree ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	21	23	his body shall not remain all night upon the tree , but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day ( for he that is hanged is a curse of God ) ; and thou shalt not defile thy land , which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	22	If a man be found lying with a man 's wife , they shall both of them die , the man that lay with the woman , and the woman ; and thou shalt put away evil from Israel .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	2	And if thy brother be not near unto thee , and thou know him not , then thou shalt bring it unto thy house , and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it , and thou shalt restore it unto him .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	3	And so shalt thou do with his ass ; and so shalt thou do with his clothing ; and so shalt thou do with everything that is lost of thy brother , which he loseth , and thou findest : thou mayest not hide thyself .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	4	Thou shalt not see thy brother 's ass or his ox fall by the way , and hide thyself from them : thou shalt in any case [ help ] him to lift them up .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	5	There shall not be a man 's apparel on a woman , neither shall a man put on a woman 's clothing ; for whoever doeth so is an abomination to Jehovah thy God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	6	If a bird 's nest chance to be before thee in the way , in any tree , or upon the ground , with young or with eggs , and the dam sitting upon the young or upon the eggs , thou shalt not take the dam with the young :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	7	thou shalt in any case let the dam go , and thou mayest take the young to thee , that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy days .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	8	When thou buildest a new house , thou shalt make a parapet for thy roof , that thou bring not blood upon thy house , if any one should in any wise fall from it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	9	Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with [ seed of ] two sorts , lest the whole of thy seed which thou hast sown , and the produce of thy vineyard , be forfeited .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	10	Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	11	Thou shalt not wear a garment of mixed material , [ woven ] of wool and linen together .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	12	Tassels shalt thou make thee on the four corners of thy clothing , wherewith thou coverest thyself .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	13	If a man take a wife , and go in unto her and hate her ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	14	and charge her with things for scandalous talk , and cause an evil name against her to be spread abroad , and say , This woman have I taken , and I came in unto her , and I did not find her a virgin ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	15	then shall the father of the damsel , and her mother , take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel 's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	16	and the damsel 's father shall say unto the elders , I gave my daughter unto this man as wife , and he hates her ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	17	and behold , he charges her with things for scandalous talk , saying , I found not thy daughter a virgin ; and here are the tokens of my daughter 's virginity . And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	18	And the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	19	and they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver , and give them unto the father of the damsel , because he hath caused an evil name to be spread abroad against a virgin in Israel . And she shall remain his wife : he may not put her away all his days .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	20	But if this thing is true , [ and ] virginity hath not been found with the damsel ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	21	then they shall bring out the damsel unto the entrance of her father 's house , and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die : because she hath wrought infamy in Israel , committing fornication in her father 's house ; and thou shalt put evil away from thy midst .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	23	If a damsel , a virgin , be betrothed to some one , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	24	then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city , and stone them with stones that they die ; the damsel , because she cried not , [ being ] in the city , and the man , because he hath humbled his neighbour 's wife ; and thou shalt put evil away from thy midst .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	25	But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her , then the man only that lay with her shall die ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	26	and unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing : there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death ; for as when a man riseth against his neighbour , and murdereth him , so is this matter ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	27	for he found her in the field , the betrothed damsel cried , and there was no one to save her .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	28	If a man find a damsel , a virgin , who is not betrothed , and lay hold on her , and lie with her , and they be found ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	29	then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel 's father fifty [ shekels ] of silver , and she shall be his wife , because he hath humbled her ; he may not put her away all his days .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	22	30	A man shall not take his father 's wife , nor uncover his father 's skirt .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	23	What is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and do , as thou hast vowed to Jehovah thy God , the voluntary-offering that thou hast promised with thy mouth .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	2	A bastard shall not come into the congregation of Jehovah ; even his tenth generation shall not come into the congregation of Jehovah .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	3	An Ammonite or Moabite shall not come into the congregation of Jehovah ; even their tenth generation shall not come into the congregation of Jehovah for ever ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	4	because they met you not with bread and with water on the way , when ye came forth out of Egypt , and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor , of Pethor of Mesopotamia , to curse thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	5	But Jehovah thy God would not listen to Balaam ; and Jehovah thy God turned the curse into blessing unto thee , because Jehovah thy God loved thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	6	Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	7	Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite ; for he is thy brother . Thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian ; because thou wast a sojourner in his land .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	8	Children that are born to them shall come into the congregation of Jehovah in the third generation .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	9	When thou goest forth into camp against thine enemies , then keep thee from every evil thing .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	10	If there be with thee a man that is not clean from what hath happened in the night , then shall he go outside the camp ; he shall not come inside the camp ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	11	and it shall be , towards evening , he shall bathe in water : and at the going down of the sun he may come inside the camp .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	12	Thou shalt have a place also outside the camp , and shalt go forth thither .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	13	And thou shalt have a shovel amongst thy weapons , and it shall be , when thou sittest down abroad , thou shalt dig therewith , and shalt turn back and cover that which is come from thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	14	For Jehovah thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp , to deliver thee , and to give up thine enemies before thee ; and thy camp shall be holy , that he see nothing unseemly with thee , and turn away from thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	15	Thou shalt not hand over to his master a bondman that hath escaped from his master unto thee :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	16	he shall dwell with thee , even in thy midst , in the place that he shall choose in one of thy gates , where it seemeth good to him ; thou shalt not oppress him .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	17	There shall be no prostitute amongst the daughters of Israel , nor any Sodomite amongst the sons of Israel .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	18	Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot , or the price of a dog , into the house of Jehovah thy God for any vow ; for even both these are an abomination to Jehovah thy God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	19	Thou shalt take no interest of thy brother , interest of money , interest of victuals , interest of anything that can be lent upon interest :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	20	of a foreigner thou mayest take interest , but of thy brother thou shalt not take interest ; that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all the business of thy hand in the land whither thou goest to possess it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	21	When thou vowest a vow to Jehovah thy God , thou shalt not delay to perform it ; for Jehovah thy God will certainly require it of thee , and it shall be sin in thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	22	But if thou forbear to vow , it shall be no sin in thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	24	When thou comest into thy neighbour 's vineyard , thou mayest eat grapes thy fill , according to thy desire , but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	23	25	When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour , thou mayest pluck ears with thy hand ; but thou shalt not wave the sickle against thy neighbour 's standing corn .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	24	When a man taketh a wife , and marrieth her , it shall be if she find no favour in his eyes , because he hath found some unseemly thing in her , that he shall write her a letter of divorce , and give it into her hand , and send her out of his house .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	2	And she shall depart out of his house , and go away , and may become another man 's wife .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	3	And if the latter husband hate her , and write her a letter of divorce , and give it into her hand , and send her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die who took her as his wife ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	4	her first husband , who sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is defiled ; for it is an abomination before Jehovah ; and thou shalt not cause the land to sin , which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	5	When a man hath newly taken a wife , he shall not go out with the army , neither shall any kind of business be imposed upon him ; he shall be free for his house one year , and shall gladden his wife whom he hath taken .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	6	No man shall take the hand-mill or the upper millstone in pledge ; for it would be taking life in pledge .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	7	If a man be found who hath stolen one of his brethren of the children of Israel , and who hath treated him as a slave and sold him , that thief shall die ; and thou shalt put evil away from thy midst .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	8	Take heed in the plague of leprosy , that thou take great heed , and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you : as I commanded them shall ye take heed to do .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	9	Remember what Jehovah thy God did unto Miriam on the way , after that ye came forth out of Egypt .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	10	When thou dost lend thy brother anything , thou shalt not go into his house to secure his pledge .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	11	Thou shalt stand outside , and the man to whom thou hast made a loan shall bring out the pledge to thee without .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	12	And if the man be needy , thou shalt not lie down with his pledge ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	13	in any case thou shalt return him the pledge at the going down of the sun , that he may sleep in his own upper garment and bless thee ; and it shall be righteousness unto thee before Jehovah thy God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	14	Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant [ who is ] poor and needy of thy brethren , or of thy sojourners who are in thy land within thy gates :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	15	on his day thou shalt give him his hire , neither shall the sun go down upon it ; for he is poor , and his soul yearneth after it ; lest he cry against thee to Jehovah , and it be a sin in thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	16	The fathers shall not be put to death for the sons , neither shall the sons be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	17	Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger , [ or ] of the fatherless ; and thou shalt not take in pledge a widow 's garment .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	18	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt , and that Jehovah thy God redeemed thee from thence ; therefore I command thee to do this thing .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	19	When thou reapest thy harvest in thy field , and forgettest a sheaf in the field , thou shalt not return to fetch it ; it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow ; that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hands .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	24	20	When thou shakest thine olive-tree , thou shalt not go over the boughs again ; it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow .

DARBY	Deuteronomy	25	25	If there be a controversy between men , and they resort to judgment , and they judge [ their case ] ; then they shall justify the righteous , and condemn the wicked .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	25	2	And it shall be if the wicked man have deserved to be beaten , that the judge shall cause him to lie down , and be beaten before his face , according to the measure of his wickedness with a certain number [ of stripes ] .

DARBY	Deuteronomy	25	5	If brethren dwell together , and one of them die , and have no son , the wife of the dead shall not marry a stranger abroad : her husband 's brother shall go in unto her , and take her to him as wife , and perform the duty of a husband 's brother unto her .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	25	6	And it shall be , that the firstborn that she beareth shall stand in the name of his brother who is dead , that his name be not blotted out from Israel .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	25	7	But if the man like not to take his brother 's wife , his brother 's wife shall go up to the gate unto the elders , and say , My husband 's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel : he will not perform for me the duty of a husband 's brother .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	25	8	Then the elders of his city shall call him and speak unto him ; and if he stand to it and say , I like not to take her ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	25	9	then shall his brother 's wife come near to him before the eyes of the elders , and draw his sandal from his foot , and spit in his face , and shall answer and say , So shall it be done unto the man that will not build up his brother 's house .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	25	10	And his name shall be called in Israel , The house of him that hath his shoe drawn off .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	25	11	When men fight together one with another , and the wife of the one come near to rescue her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him , and stretch out her hand , and seize him by his secret parts ,

DARBY	Deuteronomy	25	13	Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights , a great and a small .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	25	14	Thou shalt not have in thy house divers ephahs , a great and a small .

DARBY	Deuteronomy	25	16	For every one that doeth such things , every one that doeth unrighteousness , is an abomination to Jehovah thy God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	25	17	Remember what Amalek did unto thee on the way , when ye came forth out of Egypt ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	25	18	how he met thee on the way , and smote the hindmost of thee , all the feeble that lagged behind thee , when thou wast faint and weary , and he feared not God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	25	19	And it shall be , when Jehovah thy God shall have given thee rest from all thine enemies round about , in the land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it , that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the heavens ; thou shalt not forget it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	26	And it shall be when thou comest into the land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance , and possessest it , and dwellest therein ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	2	that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the ground , which thou shalt bring of thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee , and shalt put it in a basket , and shalt go unto the place that Jehovah thy God will choose to cause his name to dwell there ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	3	and thou shalt come unto the priest that shall be in those days , and say unto him , I profess this day unto Jehovah thy God , that I am come unto the land that Jehovah swore unto our fathers to give us .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	4	And the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand , and set it down before the altar of Jehovah thy God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	5	And thou shalt speak and say before Jehovah thy God , A perishing Aramean was my father , and he went down to Egypt with a few , and sojourned there , and became there a nation , great , mighty , and populous .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	6	And the Egyptians evil-entreated us , and afflicted us , and laid upon us hard bondage ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	7	and we cried to Jehovah , the God of our fathers , and Jehovah heard our voice , and looked on our affliction , and our labour , and our oppression ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	8	and Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt with a powerful hand , and with a stretched-out arm , and with great terribleness , and with signs , and with wonders ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	9	and he hath brought us into this place , and hath given us this land , a land flowing with milk and honey !
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	10	And now , behold , I have brought the first of the fruits of the land , which thou , Jehovah , hast given me . And thou shalt set it down before Jehovah thy God , and worship before Jehovah thy God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	11	And thou shalt rejoice in all the good that Jehovah thy God hath given to thee , and to thy house , thou , and the Levite , and the stranger that is in thy midst .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	12	When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thy produce in the third year , the year of tithing , thou shalt give it to the Levite , to the stranger , to the fatherless , and to the widow , that they may eat in thy gates , and be filled ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	13	and thou shalt say before Jehovah thy God , I have brought away the hallowed things out of the house , and also have given them to the Levite , and to the stranger , to the fatherless , and to the widow , according to all thy commandment which thou hast commanded me ; I have not transgressed nor forgotten [ any ] of thy commandments :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	14	I have not eaten thereof in my mourning , neither have I brought away thereof in uncleanness , nor given thereof for a dead person ; I have hearkened to the voice of Jehovah my God ; I have done according to all that thou hast commanded me .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	15	Look down from thy holy habitation , from the heavens , and bless thy people Israel , and the land that thou hast given us as thou didst swear unto our fathers , a land flowing with milk and honey !
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	16	This day Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and ordinances ; and thou shalt keep and do them with all thy heart and with all thy soul .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	17	Thou hast this day accepted Jehovah to be thy God , and to walk in his ways , and keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his ordinances , and to hearken unto his voice ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	18	and Jehovah hath accepted thee this day to be a people of possession to him , as he hath told thee , and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	26	19	so that he should make thee high above all the nations which he hath made , in praise and in name and in honour ; and that thou shouldest be a holy people to Jehovah thy God , as he hath said .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	27	27	And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people , saying , Keep all the commandment which I command you this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	27	2	And it shall be on the day when ye pass over the Jordan unto the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee , that thou shalt set thee up great stones , and plaster them with plaster :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	27	3	and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law , when thou goest over that thou mayest enter into the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee , a land flowing with milk and honey , as Jehovah the God of thy fathers hath promised thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	27	4	And it shall be when ye go over the Jordan , that ye shall set up these stones , as I command you this day , on mount Ebal , and thou shalt plaster them with plaster .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	27	5	And there shalt thou build an altar to Jehovah thy God , an altar of stones ; thou shalt not lift up an iron [ tool ] upon them ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	27	6	of whole stones shalt thou build the altar of Jehovah thy God ; and thou shalt offer up burnt-offerings thereon to Jehovah thy God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	27	7	And thou shalt sacrifice peace-offerings , and shalt eat there , and rejoice before Jehovah thy God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	27	8	And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly .

DARBY	Deuteronomy	27	13	And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse : Reuben , Gad , and Asher , and Zebulun , Dan , and Naphtali .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	27	14	And the Levites shall declare and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice :

DARBY	Deuteronomy	28	14	and if thou turn not aside from any of the words that I command thee this day , to the right hand or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	28	15	But it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God , to take heed to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day , that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee .

DARBY	Deuteronomy	28	45	And all these curses shall come upon thee , and shall pursue thee , and overtake thee , until thou be destroyed ; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of Jehovah thy God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	28	46	And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder , and upon thy seed for ever .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	28	47	Because thou servedst not Jehovah thy God with joyfulness , and with gladness of heart , for the abundance of everything ,

DARBY	Deuteronomy	28	55	so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children that he eateth , because he hath nothing left him in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	28	56	The eye of the tender and luxurious woman in thy midst who would not attempt to set the sole of her foot upon the ground from luxuriousness and from tenderness , shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom , and her son , and her daughter ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	28	57	because of her afterbirth which hath come out between her feet , and her children whom she shall bear ; for she shall secretly eat them for want of everything in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	28	58	If thou wilt not take heed to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , to fear this glorious and fearful name , JEHOVAH THY GOD ;

DARBY	Deuteronomy	28	65	And among these nations shalt thou have no rest , neither shall the sole of thy foot have a resting-place , and Jehovah shall give thee there a trembling heart , languishing of the eyes , and pining of the soul .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	28	66	And thy life shall hang in suspense before thee ; and thou shalt be in terror day and night and shalt be afraid of thy life .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	28	67	In the morning thou shalt say , Would that it were even ! and in the evening thou shalt say , Would that it were morning ! through the fright of thy heart wherewith thou shalt be in terror , and through the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	28	68	And Jehovah will bring thee into Egypt again with ships , by the way whereof I said unto thee , Thou shalt see it again no more ; and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen , and there shall be no man to buy [ you ] .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	29	The hidden things belong to Jehovah our God ; but the revealed ones are ours and our children 's for ever , to do all the words of this law .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	2	And Moses called to all Israel , and said unto them , Ye have seen all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh , and to all his bondmen , and to all his land :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	3	the great trials that thine eyes have seen , those great signs and wonders .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	4	But Jehovah hath not given you a heart to perceive , and eyes to see , and ears to hear , to this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	5	And I have led you forty years in the wilderness ; your clothes are not grown old upon you , and thy sandal is not grown old upon thy foot ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	6	ye have not eaten bread , neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink , that ye might know that I am Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	7	And ye came to this place ; and Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out against us for battle , and we smote them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	8	And we took their land , and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to the half tribe of the Manassites .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	9	Ye shall keep then the words of this covenant , and do them , that ye may prosper in all that ye do .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	10	Ye stand this day all of you before Jehovah your God : your chiefs [ of ] your tribes , your elders , and your officers , all the men of Israel ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	11	your little ones , your wives , and thy stranger that is in thy camp , as well the hewer of thy wood as the drawer of thy water ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	12	that thou mayest enter into the covenant of Jehovah thy God , and into his oath , which Jehovah thy God maketh with thee this day ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	13	that he may establish thee this day for a people unto himself , and [ that ] he may be to thee a God , as he hath said unto thee , and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	14	Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	15	but with him that standeth here with us this day before Jehovah our God , and with him that is not here with us this day
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	16	( for ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt , and how we came through the nations which ye passed ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	17	and ye have seen their abominations , and their idols , wood and stone , silver and gold , which were among them ) ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	18	lest there should be among you man , or woman , or family , or tribe , whose heart turneth away this day from Jehovah our God , to go and serve the gods of these nations ; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	19	and it come to pass , when he heareth the words of this curse , that he bless himself in his heart , saying , I shall have peace , though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart , to sweep away the drunken with the thirsty .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	20	Jehovah will not pardon him , but the anger of Jehovah and his jealousy will then smoke against that man , and all the curse shall be upon him that is written in this book ; and Jehovah will blot out his name from under the heavens ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	21	and Jehovah will separate him for mischief out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	22	And the generation to come , your children who shall rise up after you , and the foreigner that shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the plagues of that land , and its sicknesses wherewith Jehovah hath visited it ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	23	[ that ] the whole ground thereof is brimstone and salt , [ and ] burning , that it is not sown , nor beareth , and no grass groweth in it , like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah , Admah and Zeboim , which Jehovah overthrew in his anger and in his fury :
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	24	even all nations shall say , Why has Jehovah done thus to this land ? whence the heat of this great anger ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	25	And men shall say , Because they have forsaken the covenant of Jehovah the God of their fathers , which he had made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	26	and they went and served other gods , and bowed down to them , gods whom they knew not , and whom he had not assigned to them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	27	And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against this land , to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this book ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	29	28	and Jehovah rooted them out of their land in anger , and in fury , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as [ it appears ] this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	30	And it shall come to pass , when all these things are come upon thee , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before thee , and thou shalt take them to heart among all the nations whither Jehovah thy God hath driven thee ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	2	and shalt return to Jehovah thy God , and shalt hearken to his voice according to all that I command thee this day , thou and thy sons , with all thy heart and with all thy soul ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	3	that then Jehovah thy God will turn thy captivity , and have compassion upon thee , and will gather thee again from all the peoples whither Jehovah thy God hath scattered thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	4	Though there were of you driven out unto the end of the heavens , from thence will Jehovah thy God gather thee , and from thence will he fetch thee ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	5	and Jehovah thy God will bring thee into the land that thy fathers possessed , and thou shalt possess it ; and he will do thee good , and multiply thee above thy fathers .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	6	And Jehovah thy God will circumcise thy heart , and the heart of thy seed , to love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul , that thou mayest live .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	7	And Jehovah thy God will put all these curses on thine enemies , and on them that hate thee , who have persecuted thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	8	But thou shalt return and hearken to the voice of Jehovah , and do all his commandments which I command thee this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	9	And Jehovah thy God will make thee abound in every work of thy hand , in the fruit of thy body , and in the fruit of thy cattle , and in the fruit of thy ground , for good ; for Jehovah will again rejoice over thee for good , as he rejoiced over thy fathers ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	10	if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of Jehovah thy God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law ; if thou turn to Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	11	For this commandment which I command thee this day is not too wonderful for thee , neither is it far off .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	12	It is not in the heavens , that thou shouldest say , Who shall go up for us to the heavens , and bring it to us , that we should hear it and do it ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	13	And it is not beyond the sea , that thou shouldest say , Who shall go over the sea for us , and bring it to us , that we should hear it and do it ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	14	For the word is very near to thee , in thy mouth and in thy heart , that thou mayest do it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	15	See , I have set before thee this day life and good , and death and evil ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	16	in that I command thee this day to love Jehovah thy God , to walk in his ways , and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances , that thou mayest live and multiply , and that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	17	But if thy heart turn away , so that thou wilt not hear , but shalt be drawn away , and thou shalt bow down to other gods and serve them ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	18	I denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish ; ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whereunto thou passest over the Jordan to possess it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	19	I call heaven and earth to witness this day against you : life and death have I set before you , blessing and cursing : choose then life , that thou mayest live , thou and thy seed ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	30	20	in loving Jehovah thy God , in hearkening to his voice , and in cleaving to him—for this is thy life and the length of thy days—that thou mayest dwell in the land which Jehovah swore unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	31	And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	2	and he said unto them , I am a hundred and twenty years old this day , I can no more go out and come in ; and Jehovah hath said unto me , Thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	3	Jehovah thy God , he will go over before thee , he will destroy these nations from before thee , that thou mayest take possession of them : Joshua , he shall go over before thee , as Jehovah hath said .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	4	And Jehovah will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og , the kings of the Amorites , and to their land ; whom he destroyed .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	5	And when Jehovah giveth them up before you , ye shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	6	Be strong and courageous , fear them not , neither be afraid of them ; for Jehovah thy God , he it is that goeth with thee ; he will not leave thee , nor forsake thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	7	And Moses called to Joshua , and said to him in the sight of all Israel , Be strong and courageous , for thou must go with this people into the land which Jehovah hath sworn unto their fathers to give them ; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	8	And Jehovah , he it is that goeth before thee : he will be with thee ; he will not leave thee , nor forsake thee ; fear not , neither be dismayed .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	9	And Moses wrote this law , and delivered it to the priests , the sons of Levi , who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah , and to all the elders of Israel .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	10	And Moses commanded them , saying , At the end of every seven years , at the set time of the year of release , at the feast of tabernacles ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	11	when all Israel cometh to appear before Jehovah thy God in the place which he will choose , thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their ears .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	12	Gather the people together , the men , and the women , and the children , and thy stranger that is within thy gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear Jehovah your God , and take heed to do all the words of this law ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	13	and that their children who do not know it may hear it and learn , that they may fear Jehovah your God , as long as ye live in the land , whereunto ye pass over the Jordan to possess it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	14	And Jehovah said to Moses , Lo , the days are near for thee to die ; call Joshua , and present yourselves at the tent of meeting , that I may give him a charge . And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	15	And Jehovah appeared at the tent in the pillar of cloud ; and the pillar of cloud stood over the entrance to the tent .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	16	And Jehovah said to Moses , Behold , thou shalt sleep with thy fathers ; and this people will rise up , and go a whoring after the strange gods of the land into which they enter , and will forsake me , and break my covenant which I have made with them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	17	And my anger shall be kindled against them in that day , and I will forsake them , and I will hide my face from them , and they shall be devoured , and many evils and troubles shall befall them , and they will say in that day , Have not these evils befallen me because my God is not in my midst ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	18	And I will entirely hide my face in that day for all the evils that they have wrought , because they turned unto other gods .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	19	And now , write ye this song , and teach it to the children of Israel ; put it in their mouths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	20	For I shall bring them into the land which I swore unto their fathers , which floweth with milk and honey ; and they will eat and fill themselves , and wax fat , and will turn unto other gods , and serve them , and despise me , and break my covenant .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	21	And it shall come to pass , when many evils and troubles have befallen them , that this song shall testify against them as a witness ; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed ; for I know their imagination which they are forming already this day , before I bring them into the land which I have sworn [ unto them ] .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	22	And Moses wrote this song the same day , and taught it to the children of Israel .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	23	And [ Jehovah ] commanded Joshua the son of Nun , and said , Be strong and courageous ; for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I have sworn unto them ; and I will be with thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	24	And it came to pass , when Moses had ended writing the words of this law in a book , until their conclusion ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	25	that Moses commanded the Levites , who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah , saying ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	26	Take this book of the law , and put it at the side of the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God , that it may be there for a witness against thee ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	27	for I know thy rebellion , and thy stiff neck . Lo , while I am yet alive with you this day , ye have been rebellious against Jehovah ; and how much more after my death !
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	28	Gather to me all the elders of your tribes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their ears , and take heaven and earth to witness against them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	29	For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves , and will turn aside from the way which I have commanded you ; and mischief will befall you at the end of days ; because ye do evil in the sight of Jehovah , to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	31	30	And Moses spoke in the ears of the whole congregation of Israel the words of this song , until their conclusion .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	32	For their vine is of the vine of Sodom , And of the fields of Gomorrah : Their grapes are grapes of poison , Bitter are their clusters ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	2	My doctrine shall drop as rain , My speech flow down as dew , As small rain upon the tender herb , And as showers on the grass .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	3	For the name of Jehovah will I proclaim : Ascribe greatness unto our God !
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	4	[ He is ] the Rock , his work is perfect , For all his ways are righteousness ; A God of faithfulness without deceit , Just and right is he .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	5	They have dealt corruptly with him ; Not his children 's is their spot : —A crooked and perverted generation !
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	6	Do ye thus requite Jehovah , Foolish and unwise people ? Is not he thy father that hath bought thee ? Hath he not made thee and established thee ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	7	Remember the days of old , Consider the years of generation to generation ; Ask thy father , and he will shew thee ; Thine elders , and they will tell thee .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	8	When the Most High assigned to the nations their inheritance , When he separated the sons of Adam , He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the children of Israel .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	9	For Jehovah 's portion is his people ; Jacob the lot of his inheritance .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	10	He found him in a desert land , And in the waste , howling wilderness ; He compassed him about , he watched over him , He preserved him as the apple of his eye .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	11	As the eagle stirreth up its nest , Hovereth over its young , Spreadeth out its wings , Taketh them , beareth them on its feathers ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	12	So Jehovah alone did lead him , And no strange god [ was ] with him .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	13	He made him ride on the high places of the earth , And he ate the produce of the field ; And he made him suck honey out of the crag , And oil out of the flinty rock ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	14	Cream of kine , and milk of sheep , With the fat of lambs , And rams of the breed of Bashan , and he-goats , With the fat of kidneys of wheat ; And thou didst drink pure wine , the blood of the grape .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	15	Then Jeshurun grew fat , and kicked—Thou art waxen fat , Thou art grown thick , And thou art covered with fatness ; —He gave up +God who made him , And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	16	They moved him to jealousy with strange gods , With abominations did they provoke him to anger .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	17	They sacrificed unto demons who are not +God ; To gods whom they knew not , To new ones , who came newly up , Whom your fathers revered not .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	18	Of the Rock that begot thee wast thou unmindful , And thou hast forgotten God who brought thee forth .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	19	And Jehovah saw it , and despised them , Because of the provoking of his sons and of his daughters .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	20	And he said , I will hide my face from them , I will see what their end shall be ; For they are a perverse generation , Children in whom is no faithfulness .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	21	They have moved me to jealousy with that which is no God ; They have exasperated me with their vanities ; And I will move them to jealousy with that which is not a people ; With a foolish nation will I provoke them to anger .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	22	For a fire is kindled in mine anger , And it shall burn into the lowest Sheol , And shall consume the earth and its produce , And set fire to the foundations of the mountains .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	23	I will heap mischiefs upon them ; Mine arrows will I spend against them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	24	They shall be consumed with hunger , and devoured with burning heat , And with poisonous pestilence ; And the teeth of beasts will I send against them , With the poison of what crawleth in the dust .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	25	From without shall the sword bereave them , and in the chambers , terror—Both the young man and the virgin , The suckling with the man of gray hairs .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	26	I would say , I will scatter , I will make the remembrance of them to cease from among men ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	27	If I did not fear provocation from the enemy , Lest their adversaries should misunderstand it , Lest they should say , Our hand is high , and Jehovah has not done all this .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	28	For they are a nation void of counsel , And understanding is not in them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	29	Oh that they had been wise ! they would have understood this , They would have considered their latter end !
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	30	How could one chase a thousand , And two put ten thousand to flight , Were it not that their Rock had sold them , And Jehovah had delivered them up ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	31	For their rock is not as our Rock : Let our enemies themselves be judges .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	33	Their wine is the poison of dragons , And the cruel venom of vipers .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	34	Is not this hidden with me , Sealed up among my treasures ?
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	35	Vengeance is mine , and recompense , For the time when their foot shall slip . For the day of their calamity is at hand , And the things that shall come upon them make haste .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	36	For Jehovah will judge his people , And shall repent in favour of his servants ; When he seeth that power is gone , And there is none shut up or left .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	37	And he shall say , Where are their gods , Their rock in whom they trusted ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	38	Who ate the fat of their sacrifices , [ And ] drank the wine of their drink-offering ? Let them rise up and help you , That there may be a protection over you .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	39	See now that I , I am HE , And there is no god with me ; I kill , and I make alive ; I wound , and I heal , And there is none that delivereth out of my hand ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	40	For I lift up my hand to the heavens , and say , I live for ever !
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	41	If I have sharpened my gleaming sword , And my hand take hold of judgment , I will render vengeance to mine adversaries , And will recompense them that hate me .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	42	Mine arrows will I make drunk with blood , And my sword shall devour flesh ; [ I will make them drunk ] with the blood of the slain and of the captives , With the head of the princes of the enemy .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	43	Shout for joy , ye nations , with his people , For he avengeth the blood of his servants , And rendereth vengeance to his enemies , And maketh atonement for his land , for his people .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	44	And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people , he and Hoshea the son of Nun .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	45	And when Moses had ended speaking all these words to all Israel ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	46	he said unto them , Set your hearts unto all the words that I testify among you this day , which ye shall command your children to take heed to do , all the words of this law .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	47	For it is no vain word for you , but it is your life , and through this word ye shall prolong your days on the land whereunto ye pass over the Jordan to possess it .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	48	And Jehovah spoke to Moses that same day , saying ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	49	Go up into this mountain Abarim , mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , which is opposite Jericho ; and behold the land of Canaan , which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	50	and die on the mountain whither thou goest up , and be gathered unto thy peoples , as Aaron thy brother died on mount Hor , and was gathered unto his peoples ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	51	because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because ye hallowed me not in the midst of the children of Israel .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	32	52	For thou shalt see the land before [ thee ] ; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	33	And this is the blessing , wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	2	And he said , Jehovah came from Sinai , And rose up from Seir unto them ; He shone forth from mount Paran , And he came from the myriads of the sanctuary ; From his right hand [ went forth ] a law of fire for them .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	3	Yea , he loveth the peoples , All his saints are in thy hand , And they sit down at thy feet ; Each receiveth of thy words .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	4	Moses commanded us a law , The inheritance of the congregation of Jacob .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	5	And he was king in Jeshurun , When the heads of the people And the tribes of Israel were gathered together .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	6	Let Reuben live , and not die ; And let his men be few .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	7	And this of Judah ; and he said , Hear , Jehovah , the voice of Judah , And bring him unto his people ; May his hands strive for them ; And be thou a help to him against his oppressors .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	8	And of Levi he said , Thy Thummim and thy Urim are for thy godly one , Whom thou didst prove at Massah , With whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	9	Who said to his father and to his mother , I see him not , And he acknowledged not his brethren , And knew not his own children ; For they have observed thy word , And kept thy covenant .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	10	They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances , And Israel thy law : They shall put incense before thy nostrils , And whole burnt-offering upon thine altar .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	11	Bless , Jehovah , his substance ! And let the work of his hands please thee ; Crush the loins of his adversaries , And of them that hate him , that they may never rise again !
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	12	Of Benjamin he said , The beloved of Jehovah , —he shall dwell in safety by him ; He will cover him all the day long , And dwell between his shoulders .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	13	And of Joseph he said , Blessed of Jehovah be his land ! By the precious things of the heavens , By the dew , and by the deep that lieth beneath ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	14	And by the precious fruits of the sun , And by the precious things put forth by the months ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	15	And by the best things of the ancient mountains , And by the precious things of the everlasting hills ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	16	And by the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof . And let the good will of him that dwelt in the bush Come upon the head of Joseph , Upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	17	His majesty is as the firstling of his ox ; And his horns are as the horns of a buffalo . With them shall he push the peoples Together to the ends of the earth . These are the myriads of Ephraim , And these are the thousands of Manasseh .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	18	And of Zebulun he said , Rejoice , Zebulun , in thy going out ; And thou , Issachar , in thy tents !
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	19	They shall invite [ the ] peoples to the mountain ; There they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness ; For they will suck the abundance of the seas , And the hidden treasures of the sand .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	20	And of Gad he said , Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad ! As a lion doth he dwell , and teareth the arm , even the top of the head .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	21	And he provided the first part for himself , For there was reserved the portion of the lawgiver ; And he came with the heads of the people ; The justice of Jehovah and his judgments Hath he executed with Israel .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	22	And of Dan he said , Dan is a young lion ; He shall spring forth from Bashan .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	23	And of Naphtali he said , Naphtali , satisfied with favour , And full of the blessing of Jehovah , Possess thou the west and the south .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	24	And of Asher he said , Asher shall be blessed with sons ; Let him be acceptable to his brethren , And let him dip his foot in oil .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	25	Iron and brass shall be thy bolts ; And thy rest as thy days .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	26	There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun , Who rideth upon the heavens to thy help , And in his majesty , upon the clouds .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	27	[ Thy ] refuge is the God of old , And underneath are the eternal arms ; And he shall drive out the enemy from before thee , And shall say , Destroy [ them ] !
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	28	And Israel shall dwell in safety alone , The fountain of Jacob , in a land of corn and new wine ; Also his heavens shall drop down dew .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	33	29	Happy art thou , Israel ! Who is like unto thee , a people saved by Jehovah , The shield of thy help , And the sword of thine excellency ? And thine enemies shall come cringing to thee ; And thou shalt tread upon their high places .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	34	34	And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to mount Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , which is opposite Jericho . And Jehovah shewed him the whole land , Gilead to Dan ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	34	2	and all Naphtali , and the land of Ephraim , and Manasseh , and all the land of Judah , unto the hindmost sea ,
DARBY	Deuteronomy	34	3	and the south , and the plain of the valley of Jericho , the city of palm-trees , to Zoar .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	34	4	And Jehovah said unto him , This is the land that I swore unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , saying , Unto thy seed will I give it : I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes , but thou shalt not go over thither .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	34	5	And Moses the servant of Jehovah died there in the land of Moab , according to the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	34	6	And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab , opposite Beth-Peor ; and no man knows his sepulchre to this day .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	34	7	And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died ; his eye was not dim , nor his natural force abated .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	34	8	And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days ; and the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	34	9	And Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom , for Moses had laid his hands upon him ; and the children of Israel hearkened unto him , and did as Jehovah had commanded Moses .
DARBY	Deuteronomy	34	10	And there arose no prophet since in Israel like Moses , whom Jehovah had known face to face ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	34	11	according to all the signs and wonders that Jehovah had sent him to do in the land of Egypt , to Pharaoh , and to all his servants , and to all his land ;
DARBY	Deuteronomy	34	12	and according to all that mighty hand ; and according to all the great terribleness that Moses had wrought in the sight of all Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	1	1	And it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of Jehovah , that Jehovah spoke to Joshua the son of Nun , Moses ' attendant , saying ,
DARBY	Joshua	1	2	Moses my servant is dead ; and now , rise up , go over this Jordan , thou and all this people , into the land which I give unto them , to the children of Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	1	3	Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread have I given to you , as I said unto Moses .
DARBY	Joshua	1	4	From the wilderness and this Lebanon to the great river , the river Euphrates , the whole land of the Hittites , to the great sea , toward the going down of the sun , shall be your border .
DARBY	Joshua	1	5	None shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life : as I was with Moses , so will I be with thee ; I will not leave thee , neither will I forsake thee .
DARBY	Joshua	1	6	Be strong and courageous , for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I have sworn unto their fathers to give them .
DARBY	Joshua	1	7	Only be strong and very courageous , that thou mayest take heed to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded thee . Turn not from it to the right or to the left , that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest .
DARBY	Joshua	1	8	This book of the law shall not depart from thy mouth ; and thou shalt meditate upon it day and night , that thou mayest take heed to do according to all that is written therein ; for then shalt thou have good success in thy ways , and then shalt thou prosper .
DARBY	Joshua	1	9	Have I not commanded thee : Be strong and courageous ? Be not afraid , neither be dismayed ; for Jehovah thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest .
DARBY	Joshua	1	10	And Joshua commanded the officers of the people , saying ,
DARBY	Joshua	1	11	Go through the midst of the camp , and command the people , saying , Prepare yourselves victuals , for in three days ye shall pass over this Jordan , that ye may enter in to take possession of the land which Jehovah your God giveth you to possess it .
DARBY	Joshua	1	12	And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to half the tribe of Manasseh spoke Joshua , saying ,
DARBY	Joshua	1	13	Remember the word that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you , saying , Jehovah your God has given you rest and has given you this land .
DARBY	Joshua	1	14	Your wives , your little ones , and your cattle shall abide in the land that Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan , but ye , all the valiant men , shall go over in array before your brethren and help them ,
DARBY	Joshua	1	15	until Jehovah give your brethren rest as to you , and they also take possession of the land which Jehovah your God giveth them ; then shall ye return into the land of your possession and possess it , which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you on this side of the Jordan toward the sun-rising .
DARBY	Joshua	1	16	And they answered Joshua , saying , All that thou hast commanded us will we do , and whither thou shalt send us will we go .
DARBY	Joshua	1	17	According as we hearkened to Moses in all things , so will we hearken to thee ; only may Jehovah thy God be with thee as he was with Moses .
DARBY	Joshua	1	18	Every one that is rebellious against thy commandment and hearkeneth not to thy words in everything that thou commandest us , shall be put to death . Only be strong and courageous .
DARBY	Joshua	2	2	And it was told the king of Jericho , saying , Behold , men have come hither to-night from the children of Israel to search out the land .
DARBY	Joshua	2	3	And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab , saying , Bring forth the men that have come to thee , who have come into thy house : for they have come to search out all the land .
DARBY	Joshua	2	4	And the woman had taken and concealed the two men ; and she said , Yes , the men did come unto me , but I knew not whence they were ;
DARBY	Joshua	2	5	and it came to pass when the gate had to be closed , at dark , that the men went out : I know not whither the men have gone . Pursue after them quickly ; for ye shall overtake them .
DARBY	Joshua	2	6	But she had taken them up to the roof , and secreted them under the stalks of flax , which she had laid out on the roof .
DARBY	Joshua	2	7	And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan , to the fords ; and when they who pursued after them had gone out , they closed the gate .
DARBY	Joshua	2	8	And before they had lain down , she went up to them upon the roof ;
DARBY	Joshua	2	9	and said to the men , I know that Jehovah has given you the land , and that the dread of you has fallen on us , and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you .
DARBY	Joshua	2	10	For we have heard that Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red sea before you when ye came out of Egypt ; and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan , to Sihon and to Og , whom ye utterly destroyed .
DARBY	Joshua	2	11	We heard [ of it ] , and our heart melted , and there remained no more spirit in any man because of you ; for Jehovah your God , he is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath .
DARBY	Joshua	2	12	And now , I pray you , swear to me by Jehovah , since I have dealt kindly with you , that ye will also deal kindly with my father 's house , and give me a certain sign ,
DARBY	Joshua	2	13	that ye will let my father live , and my mother , and my brethren , and my sisters , and all that belong to them , and deliver our souls from death .
DARBY	Joshua	2	14	And the men said to her , Our lives shall pay for yours , if ye do not make this our business known ; and it shall be when Jehovah shall give us the land , that we will deal kindly and truly with thee .
DARBY	Joshua	2	15	And she let them down by a cord through the window ; for her house was upon the city-wall , and she dwelt upon the wall .
DARBY	Joshua	2	16	And she said to them , Go to the mountain , that the pursuers may not meet with you ; and hide yourselves there three days , until the pursuers have returned ; and afterwards go your way .
DARBY	Joshua	2	17	And the men said to her , We will be quit of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear .
DARBY	Joshua	2	18	Behold , when we come into the land , thou shalt bind in the window this line of scarlet thread by which thou hast let us down ; and thou shalt gather to thee in the house thy father , and thy mother , and thy brethren , and all thy father 's household ;
DARBY	Joshua	2	19	and it shall be , that whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street , —his blood shall be upon his head , and we shall be innocent ; but every one who shall be with thee in the house , his blood shall be upon our head , if any hand be upon him .
DARBY	Joshua	2	20	And if thou make known this our business , we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us swear .
DARBY	Joshua	2	21	And she said , According to your words , so be it . And she sent them away , and they departed . And she bound the scarlet line in the window .
DARBY	Joshua	2	22	And they went , and came to the mountain , and remained there three days , until the pursuers had returned ; and the pursuers sought them all the way , and found them not .
DARBY	Joshua	2	23	And the two men returned and came down from the mountain , and went over and came to Joshua the son of Nun , and related to him everything that had happened to them .
DARBY	Joshua	2	24	And they said to Joshua , Of a surety Jehovah has given the whole land into our hands , and even all the inhabitants of the land faint because of us .
DARBY	Joshua	3	3	and they commanded the people , saying , When ye see the ark of the covenant of Jehovah your God , and the priests the Levites bearing it , then remove from your place , and go after it ;
DARBY	Joshua	3	2	And it came to pass at the end of three days , that the officers went through the camp ;
DARBY	Joshua	3	4	yet there shall be a distance between you and it , about two thousand cubits by measure . Ye shall not come near it , that ye may know the way by which ye must go ; for ye have not passed this way heretofore .
DARBY	Joshua	3	5	And Joshua said to the people , Hallow yourselves ; for to-morrow Jehovah will do wonders in your midst .
DARBY	Joshua	3	6	And Joshua spoke to the priests , saying , Take up the ark of the covenant , and go over before the people . And they took up the ark of the covenant , and went before the people .
DARBY	Joshua	3	7	And Jehovah said to Joshua , This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel , that they may know that as I was with Moses , so will I be with thee .
DARBY	Joshua	3	8	And thou shalt command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant , saying , When ye come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan , stand still in the Jordan .
DARBY	Joshua	3	9	And Joshua said to the children of Israel , Come hither , and hear the words of Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Joshua	3	10	And Joshua said , Hereby shall ye know that the living God is in your midst , and [ that ] he will without fail dispossess from before you the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Hivites , and the Perizzites , and the Girgashites , and the Amorites , and the Jebusites .
DARBY	Joshua	3	11	Behold , the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is going over before you into the Jordan .
DARBY	Joshua	3	12	And now take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel , one man for each tribe .
DARBY	Joshua	3	13	And it shall come to pass , when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of Jehovah , the Lord of all the earth , rest in the waters of the Jordan , the waters of the Jordan , the waters flowing down from above , shall be cut off , and shall stand up in a heap .
DARBY	Joshua	3	14	And it came to pass when the people removed from their tents , to pass over the Jordan , that the priests bearing the ark of the covenant were before the people ;
DARBY	Joshua	3	15	and when they that bore the ark were come to the Jordan , and the feet of the priests who bore the ark dipped in the edge of the water ( and the Jordan is full over all its banks throughout the days of harvest ) ,
DARBY	Joshua	3	16	the waters which flowed down from above stood [ and ] rose up in a heap , very far , by Adam , the city that is beside Zaretan ; and those that flowed down towards the sea of the plain , the salt sea , were completely cut off . And the people went over opposite to Jericho .
DARBY	Joshua	3	17	And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan . And all Israel went over on dry ground , until all the nation had completely gone over the Jordan .
DARBY	Joshua	4	4	And Joshua called the twelve men , whom he had appointed of the children of Israel , a man out of every tribe ;
DARBY	Joshua	4	2	Take you twelve men out of the people , one man out of every tribe ,
DARBY	Joshua	4	3	and command them , saying , Take up hence out of the midst of the Jordan , from the place where the priests ' feet stood firm , twelve stones , and carry them over with you , and lay them down in the lodging-place where ye shall lodge this night .
DARBY	Joshua	4	5	and Joshua said to them , Pass before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of the Jordan , and lift up each of you a stone [ and put it ] upon his shoulder , according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel ,
DARBY	Joshua	4	6	that this may be a sign in your midst . When your children ask hereafter , saying , What mean ye by these stones ?
DARBY	Joshua	4	7	then ye shall say to them , That the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah ; when it went through the Jordan , the waters of the Jordan were cut off . And these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever .
DARBY	Joshua	4	8	And the children of Israel did so , as Joshua had commanded , and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan , as Jehovah had spoken to Joshua , according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel ; and they carried them over with them to the lodging-place , and laid them down there .
DARBY	Joshua	4	9	And twelve stones did Joshua set up in the midst of the Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant had stood firm ; and they are there to this day .
DARBY	Joshua	4	10	And the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan , until everything was finished that Jehovah had commanded Joshua to speak unto the people , according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua . And the people hasted and passed over .
DARBY	Joshua	4	11	And it came to pass , when all the people had completely gone over , that the ark of Jehovah went over , and the priests , in the presence of the people .
DARBY	Joshua	4	12	And the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and the half tribe of Manasseh , went over in array before the children of Israel , as Moses had spoken to them .
DARBY	Joshua	4	13	About forty thousand armed for military service passed over before Jehovah to the war , unto the plains of Jericho .
DARBY	Joshua	4	14	On that day Jehovah magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel ; and they feared him , as they had feared Moses , all the days of his life .
DARBY	Joshua	4	15	And Jehovah spoke to Joshua , saying ,
DARBY	Joshua	4	16	Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony , that they come up out of the Jordan .
DARBY	Joshua	4	17	And Joshua commanded the priests , saying , Come up out of the Jordan .
DARBY	Joshua	4	18	And it came to pass when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah had come up out of the midst of the Jordan , [ when ] the soles of the priests ' feet were lifted up on to the dry land , that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place , and they flowed as previously , over all its banks .
DARBY	Joshua	4	19	And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth of the first month , and encamped in Gilgal , on the eastern extremity of Jericho .
DARBY	Joshua	4	20	And those twelve stones which they had taken out of the Jordan did Joshua set up in Gilgal .
DARBY	Joshua	4	21	And he spoke to the children of Israel , saying , When your children hereafter ask their fathers , saying , What [ mean ] these stones ?
DARBY	Joshua	4	22	then ye shall let your children know , saying , On dry land did Israel come over this Jordan ;
DARBY	Joshua	4	23	because Jehovah your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you , until ye had passed over , as Jehovah your God did to the Red sea , which he dried up from before us , until we had passed over ;
DARBY	Joshua	4	24	that all peoples of the earth might know the hand of Jehovah , that it is mighty ; that ye might fear Jehovah your God continually .
DARBY	Joshua	5	5	For all the people that came out were circumcised ; but all the people that were born in the wilderness on the way , after they came out of Egypt , [ them ] had they not circumcised .
DARBY	Joshua	5	2	At that time Jehovah said to Joshua , Make thee stone-knives , and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time .
DARBY	Joshua	5	3	And Joshua made him stone-knives , and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of Araloth .
DARBY	Joshua	5	4	And this is the cause why Joshua circumcised [ them ] : all the people that had come out of Egypt , the males , all the men of war , had died in the wilderness on the way , after they came out of Egypt .
DARBY	Joshua	5	6	For the children of Israel had walked forty years in the wilderness , till the whole nation of men of war had perished who had come out of Egypt , who had not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah ; to whom Jehovah had sworn that he would not show them the land which Jehovah had sworn unto their fathers that he would give us , a land flowing with milk and honey .
DARBY	Joshua	5	7	And their sons [ whom ] he raised up in their stead , them Joshua circumcised , for they were uncircumcised , because they had not circumcised them on the way .
DARBY	Joshua	5	8	And it came to pass when the whole nation had finished being circumcised , that they abode in their place in the camp , till they were whole .
DARBY	Joshua	5	9	And Jehovah said to Joshua , This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you . And the name of the place was called Gilgal to this day .
DARBY	Joshua	5	10	And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal , and held the passover on the fourteenth day of the month , at even , in the plains of Jericho .
DARBY	Joshua	5	11	And they ate of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover , unleavened loaves , and roasted [ corn ] on that same day .
DARBY	Joshua	5	12	And the manna ceased on the morrow , when they had eaten of the old corn of the land ; and there was no more manna for the children of Israel ; and they ate of the produce of the land of Canaan that year .
DARBY	Joshua	5	13	And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho , that he lifted up his eyes and looked , and behold , there stood a man before him with his sword drawn in his hand . And Joshua went to him , and said to him : Art thou for us , or for our enemies ?
DARBY	Joshua	5	14	And he said , No ; for [ as ] captain of the army of Jehovah am I now come . Then Joshua fell upon his face to the earth , and worshipped , and said to him , What saith my lord unto his servant ?
DARBY	Joshua	5	15	And the captain of Jehovah 's army said to Joshua , Loose thy sandal from off thy foot : for the place whereon thou standest is holy . And Joshua did so .
DARBY	Joshua	6	6	And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests , and said to them , Carry the ark of the covenant , and seven priests shall carry seven blast-trumpets before the ark of Jehovah .
DARBY	Joshua	6	2	And Jehovah said to Joshua , See , I have given into thy hand Jericho , and the king thereof , [ and ] the valiant men .
DARBY	Joshua	6	3	And ye shall go round the city , all the men of war , encompassing the city once . Thus shalt thou do six days .
DARBY	Joshua	6	4	And seven priests shall carry before the ark seven blast-trumpets ; and on the seventh day ye shall go round the city seven times , and the priests shall blow with the trumpets .
DARBY	Joshua	6	5	And it shall come to pass when they make a long blast with the blast-horn , that all the people on hearing the sound of the trumpet shall shout with a great shout ; and the wall of the city shall fall flat , and the people shall go up , each one straight before him .
DARBY	Joshua	6	7	And he said to the people , Pass on , go round the city , and they that are armed shall pass on before the ark of Jehovah .
DARBY	Joshua	6	8	And it came to pass when Joshua had spoken to the people , that the seven priests carrying the seven blast-trumpets before Jehovah passed on and blew with the trumpets ; and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah went after them .
DARBY	Joshua	6	9	And the armed men went before the priests who blew with the trumpets , and the rearguard came after the ark ; they blew with the trumpets in marching .
DARBY	Joshua	6	10	And Joshua had commanded the people , saying , Ye shall not shout , nor let your voice be heard , neither shall a word proceed out of your mouth , until the day I say to you , Shout ; then shall ye shout .
DARBY	Joshua	6	11	And the ark of Jehovah went round the city , encompassing [ it ] once ; and they came into the camp , and lodged in the camp .
DARBY	Joshua	6	12	And Joshua rose early in the morning , and the priests carried the ark of Jehovah .
DARBY	Joshua	6	13	And the seven priests carrying the seven blast-trumpets before the ark of Jehovah went on and blew continually with the trumpets ; and the armed men went before them , and the rearguard went after the ark of Jehovah ; they blew with the trumpets in marching .
DARBY	Joshua	6	14	And on the second day they went round the city once , and returned into the camp . So they did six days .
DARBY	Joshua	6	15	And it was so that on the seventh day they rose early , about the morning-dawn , and went round the city after the same manner seven times ; only on that day they went round the city seven times .
DARBY	Joshua	6	16	And it came to pass the seventh time , when the priests blew with the trumpets , that Joshua said to the people , Shout ; for Jehovah has given you the city .
DARBY	Joshua	6	17	And the city shall be accursed , it and all that is in it , to Jehovah ; only Rahab the harlot shall live , she and all that are with her in the house , because she hid the messengers that we sent .
DARBY	Joshua	6	18	But in any wise keep from the accursed thing , lest ye make [ yourselves ] accursed in taking of the accursed thing , and make the camp of Israel a curse , and trouble it .
DARBY	Joshua	6	19	And all the silver , and gold , and vessels of copper and iron , shall be holy to Jehovah ; they shall come into the treasury of Jehovah .
DARBY	Joshua	6	20	And the people shouted , and they blew with the trumpets . And it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpets , and the people shouted with a great shout , that the wall fell down flat ; and the people went up into the city , each one straight before him , and they took the city .
DARBY	Joshua	6	21	And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city ; both man and woman , young and old , and ox , and sheep , and ass , with the edge of the sword .
DARBY	Joshua	6	22	And Joshua said to the two men that had spied out the country , Go into the harlot 's house and bring out thence the woman , and all that she has , as ye swore unto her .
DARBY	Joshua	6	23	And the young men , the spies , went in and brought out Rahab , and her father , and her mother , and her brethren , and all that she had : all her kindred did they bring out , and they left them outside the camp of Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	6	24	And they burned the city with fire , and all that was therein ; only the silver , and the gold , and the vessels of copper and of iron , they put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	Joshua	6	25	And Joshua saved alive Rahab the harlot , and her father 's household , and all that she had , and she dwelt in the midst of Israel to this day ; because she hid the messengers whom Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho .
DARBY	Joshua	6	26	And Joshua swore at that time , saying , Cursed be the man before Jehovah who shall rise up and build this city Jericho ! In his first-born shall he lay its foundation , and in his youngest son shall he set up its gates .
DARBY	Joshua	6	27	And Jehovah was with Joshua ; and his fame was in all the land .
DARBY	Joshua	7	7	And Joshua said , Alas , Lord Jehovah , wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over the Jordan , to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites , to destroy us ? Oh that we had been content and had remained beyond the Jordan !
DARBY	Joshua	7	2	And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai , which is beside Beth-Aven , on the east side of Bethel , and spoke to them , saying , Go up and spy out the country . And the men went up and spied out Ai .
DARBY	Joshua	7	3	And they returned to Joshua , and said to him , Let not all the people go up ; let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai ; make not all the people to toil thither , for they are few .
DARBY	Joshua	7	4	And there went up thither of the people about three thousand men , but they fled before the men of Ai .
DARBY	Joshua	7	5	And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty-six men ; and they pursued them from before the gate to Shebarim , and smote them on the descent . Then the hearts of the people melted , and became as water .
DARBY	Joshua	7	6	And Joshua rent his clothes , and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of Jehovah until the evening , he and the elders of Israel , and threw dust upon their heads .
DARBY	Joshua	7	8	Ah Lord ! what shall I say after Israel have turned their backs before their enemies ?
DARBY	Joshua	7	9	When the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear [ of it ] , they will surround us , and cut off our name from the earth . And what wilt thou do unto thy great name ?
DARBY	Joshua	7	10	And Jehovah said to Joshua , Rise up ; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face ?
DARBY	Joshua	7	11	Israel hath sinned , and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them , and they have even taken of the accursed thing , and have also stolen , and dissembled also , and they have put it among their stuff .
DARBY	Joshua	7	12	And the children of Israel shall not be able to stand before their enemies : they shall turn their backs before their enemies , for they have made themselves accursed . I will no more be with you , except ye destroy the accursed thing from your midst .
DARBY	Joshua	7	13	Rise up , hallow the people , and say , Hallow yourselves for to-morrow ; for thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel , There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee , Israel : thou shalt not be able to stand before thine enemies , until ye take away the accursed thing from your midst .
DARBY	Joshua	7	14	And ye shall be brought near in the morning according to your tribes ; and it shall be , that the tribe which Jehovah taketh shall come forward by families , and the family which Jehovah taketh shall come forward by households ; and the household which Jehovah taketh shall come forward man by man .
DARBY	Joshua	7	15	And it shall be , that he who is taken with the accursed thing shall be burned with fire , he and all that he hath , because he hath transgressed the covenant of Jehovah , and because he hath wrought wickedness in Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	7	16	And Joshua rose early in the morning , and caused Israel to come forward by their tribes , and the tribe of Judah was taken .
DARBY	Joshua	7	17	And he caused the families of Judah to come forward , and he took the family of the Zarhites . And he caused the family of the Zarhites to come forward man by man , and Zabdi was taken .
DARBY	Joshua	7	18	And he caused his household to come forward man by man , and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was taken .
DARBY	Joshua	7	19	And Joshua said to Achan , My son , give , I pray thee , glory to Jehovah the God of Israel , and make confession to him : tell me now what thou hast done , keep it not back from me .
DARBY	Joshua	7	20	And Achan answered Joshua and said , Indeed I have sinned against Jehovah the God of Israel , and thus and thus have I done .
DARBY	Joshua	7	21	I saw among the spoils a beautiful mantle of Shinar , and two hundred shekels of silver , and a golden bar of fifty shekels weight , and I coveted them and took them ; and behold , they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent , and the silver under it .
DARBY	Joshua	7	22	And Joshua sent messengers , and they ran to the tent , and behold , it was hid in his tent , and the silver under it .
DARBY	Joshua	7	23	And they took them out of the midst of the tent , and brought them to Joshua and to all the children of Israel , and laid them out before Jehovah .
DARBY	Joshua	7	24	Then Joshua , and all Israel with him , took Achan the son of Zerah , and the silver , and the mantle , and the bar of gold , and his sons , and his daughters , and his oxen , and his asses , and his sheep , and his tent , and all that he had ; and they brought them up into the valley of Achor .
DARBY	Joshua	7	25	And Joshua said , How hast thou troubled us ! Jehovah will trouble thee this day . And all Israel stoned him with stones ; and they burned them with fire , and stoned them with stones .
DARBY	Joshua	7	26	And they raised over him a great heap of stones , [ which is there ] to this day . And Jehovah turned from the fierceness of his anger . Therefore the name of that place was called , The Valley of Achor , to this day .
DARBY	Joshua	8	8	And it shall be when ye have taken the city , that ye shall set the city on fire ; according to the word of Jehovah shall ye do . See , I have commanded you .
DARBY	Joshua	8	2	And thou shalt do to Ai and to its king as thou didst to Jericho and to its king ; only , the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall ye take as prey for yourselves . Set an ambush against the city behind it .
DARBY	Joshua	8	3	And Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up to Ai . And Joshua chose thirty thousand valiant men , and sent them away by night .
DARBY	Joshua	8	4	And he commanded them , saying , See , ye shall be in ambush against the city , behind the city : go not very far from the city , and be all of you ready .
DARBY	Joshua	8	5	And I and all the people that are with me will approach to the city ; and it shall come to pass when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them .
DARBY	Joshua	8	6	And they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city ; for they will say , They flee before us , as at the first ; and we will flee before them .
DARBY	Joshua	8	7	And ye shall rise up from the ambush and take possession of the city ; and Jehovah your God will deliver it into your hand .
DARBY	Joshua	8	9	And Joshua sent them forth ; and they went to lie in ambush , and abode between Bethel and Ai , on the west of Ai . And Joshua lodged that night among the people .
DARBY	Joshua	8	10	And Joshua rose early in the morning , and inspected the people , and went up , he and the elders of Israel , before the people to Ai .
DARBY	Joshua	8	11	And all the people of war that were with him went up , and drew near , and came before the city ; and they encamped on the north of Ai ; and the valley was between them and Ai .
DARBY	Joshua	8	12	Now he had taken about five thousand men , and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai , on the west of the city .
DARBY	Joshua	8	13	And when they had set the people , the whole camp on the north of the city , and their ambush on the west of the city , Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
DARBY	Joshua	8	14	And it came to pass when the king of Ai saw it , that the men of the city hasted and rose early , and went out against Israel to battle , he and all his people , at the appointed place before the plain . But he knew not that there was an ambush against him behind the city .
DARBY	Joshua	8	15	And Joshua and all Israel let themselves be beaten before them ; and they fled by the way of the wilderness .
DARBY	Joshua	8	16	And all the people that were in the city were called together to pursue after them ; and they pursued after Joshua , and were drawn away from the city .
DARBY	Joshua	8	17	And not a man remained in Ai and Bethel that went not out after Israel ; and they left the city open , and pursued after Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	8	18	And Jehovah said to Joshua , Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand toward Ai ; for I will give it into thy hand . And Joshua stretched out the javelin that he had in his hand toward the city .
DARBY	Joshua	8	19	And the ambush arose quickly from their place , and they ran when he stretched out his hand , and came into the city , and took it , and hasted and set the city on fire .
DARBY	Joshua	8	20	And the men of Ai turned and saw , and behold , the smoke of the city went up to heaven , and they had no power to flee this way or that way ; and the people that fled to the wilderness turned upon the pursuers .
DARBY	Joshua	8	21	When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city went up , they turned again , and slew the men of Ai .
DARBY	Joshua	8	22	And the others went out of the city against them ; so they were in the midst of Israel , some on this side , and some on that side ; and they smote them , until they let none of them escape or flee away .
DARBY	Joshua	8	23	And the king of Ai they took alive , and brought him to Joshua .
DARBY	Joshua	8	24	And it came to pass when Israel had ended slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field , in the wilderness wherein they had chased them , and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword , until they were consumed , that all Israel returned to Ai , and smote it with the edge of the sword .
DARBY	Joshua	8	25	And so it was , that all who fell that day , men as well as women , were twelve thousand , all the people of Ai .
DARBY	Joshua	8	26	And Joshua did not draw back his hand , which he had stretched out with the javelin , until they had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai .
DARBY	Joshua	8	27	Only , the cattle and the spoil of the city Israel took as prey to themselves , according to the word of Jehovah which he had commanded Joshua .
DARBY	Joshua	8	28	And Joshua burned Ai , and made it an everlasting heap of desolation to this day .
DARBY	Joshua	8	29	And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the evening ; and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded , and they took his carcase down from the tree , and threw it down at the entrance of the gate of the city , and raised upon it a great heap of stones , [ which remains ] to this day .
DARBY	Joshua	8	30	Then Joshua built an altar to Jehovah the God of Israel , in mount Ebal ,
DARBY	Joshua	8	31	as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded the children of Israel , as it is written in the book of the law of Moses , an altar of whole stones , over which iron had not been lifted up . And they offered up burnt-offerings on it to Jehovah , and sacrificed peace-offerings .
DARBY	Joshua	8	32	And he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses , which he had written before the children of Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	8	33	And all Israel , and their elders , and their officers and judges , stood on this side and on that side of the ark before the priests the Levites , who bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah , as well the stranger as the home-born [ Israelite ] ; half of them toward mount Gerizim , and the other half of them toward mount Ebal ; as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded , that they should bless the people of Israel , in the beginning .
DARBY	Joshua	8	34	And afterwards he read all the words of the law , the blessing and the curse , according to all that is written in the book of the law .
DARBY	Joshua	8	35	There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua read not before the whole congregation of Israel , and the women , and the children , and the strangers that lived among them .
DARBY	Joshua	9	9	And they said to him , From a very far country are thy servants come , because of the name of Jehovah thy God ; for we have heard the fame of him , and all that he did in Egypt ,
DARBY	Joshua	9	2	that they assembled together , to fight with Joshua and with Israel , with one accord .
DARBY	Joshua	9	3	And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai ,
DARBY	Joshua	9	4	then they also acted with craft , and they went prepared as on a journey , and took old sacks upon their asses , and wine-flasks , old and rent and tied up ;
DARBY	Joshua	9	5	and old and patched sandals upon their feet , and old garments upon them ; and all the bread of their provision was dry [ and ] mouldy .
DARBY	Joshua	9	6	And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal , and said to him , and to the men of Israel , From a far country are we come ; and now make a covenant with us .
DARBY	Joshua	9	7	And the men of Israel said to the Hivite , Perhaps thou dwellest in the midst of us , and how should I make a covenant with thee ?
DARBY	Joshua	9	8	And they said unto Joshua , We are thy servants . And Joshua said to them , Who are ye ? and from whence come ye ?
DARBY	Joshua	9	10	and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond Jordan , to Sihon the king of Heshbon , and to Og the king of Bashan , who was at Ashtaroth .
DARBY	Joshua	9	11	And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us , saying , Take victuals in your hand for the way , and go to meet them , and say to them , We are your servants , and now make a covenant with us .
DARBY	Joshua	9	12	This our bread we took warm for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you ; and now , behold , it is dry , and is become mouldy .
DARBY	Joshua	9	13	And these flasks of wine which we filled new , behold , they are rent ; and these our garments and our sandals are become old by reason of the very long journey .
DARBY	Joshua	9	14	And the men took of their victuals , but they did not inquire at the mouth of Jehovah .
DARBY	Joshua	9	15	And Joshua made peace with them , and made a covenant with them , to let them live ; and the princes of the assembly swore unto them .
DARBY	Joshua	9	16	And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them , that they heard that they were their neighbours , and that they dwelt in their midst .
DARBY	Joshua	9	17	And the children of Israel journeyed , and came to their cities on the third day ; and their cities were Gibeon , and Chephirah , and Beeroth , and Kirjath-jearim .
DARBY	Joshua	9	18	And the children of Israel did not smite them , because the princes of the assembly had sworn unto them by Jehovah the God of Israel . Then all the assembly murmured against the princes .
DARBY	Joshua	9	19	And all the princes said to all the assembly , We have sworn unto them by Jehovah the God of Israel , and now we may not touch them .
DARBY	Joshua	9	20	This we will do to them , and let them live , lest wrath come upon us , because of the oath which we swore unto them .
DARBY	Joshua	9	21	And the princes said to them , Let them live . And they were hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the assembly ; as the princes had said to them .
DARBY	Joshua	9	22	And Joshua called for them , and he spoke to them , saying , Why have ye deceived us , saying , We are very far from you ; whereas ye dwell in our midst ?
DARBY	Joshua	9	23	And now ye are cursed , and ye shall never cease to be bondmen , and hewers of wood , and drawers of water for the house of my God .
DARBY	Joshua	9	24	And they answered Joshua and said , Because it was certainly told thy servants how that Jehovah thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land , and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you ; and we feared greatly for our lives because of you , and did this thing .
DARBY	Joshua	9	25	And now behold , we are in thy hand : as it is good and right in thine eyes to do to us , do .
DARBY	Joshua	9	26	And he did so to them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , and they did not slay them .
DARBY	Joshua	9	27	And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the assembly , and for the altar of Jehovah , to this day , in the place which he should choose .
DARBY	Joshua	10	10	And Jehovah discomfited them before Israel , and smote them [ with ] a great slaughter at Gibeon ; and he chased them on the way of the ascent of Beth-horon , and smote them up to Azekah and Makkedah .
DARBY	Joshua	10	2	that they feared greatly ; for Gibeon was a great city , as one of the royal cities , and it was greater than Ai , and all its men were mighty .
DARBY	Joshua	10	3	And Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron , and to Piream king of Jarmuth , and to Japhia king of Lachish , and to Debir king of Eglon , saying ,
DARBY	Joshua	10	4	Come up to me , and help me , that we may smite Gibeon ; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	10	5	And the five kings of the Amorites , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , [ and ] the king of Eglon , gathered themselves together , and went up , they and all their armies , and they encamped before Gibeon , and made war against it .
DARBY	Joshua	10	6	And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua , to the camp at Gilgal , saying , Withdraw not thy hand from thy servants : come up to us quickly , and save us and help us ; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country are gathered against us .
DARBY	Joshua	10	7	So Joshua went up from Gilgal , he and all the people of war with him , even all the valiant men .
DARBY	Joshua	10	8	And Jehovah said to Joshua , Fear them not ; for into thy hand have I given them : not a man of them shall stand before thee .
DARBY	Joshua	10	9	And Joshua came upon them suddenly ; he went up from Gilgal all night .
DARBY	Joshua	10	11	And it came to pass , as they fled from before Israel , —they were at the descent of Beth-horon , —that Jehovah cast down great stones from heaven upon them up to Azekah , and they died . They were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the children of Israel had slain with the sword .
DARBY	Joshua	10	12	Then spoke Joshua to Jehovah in the day when Jehovah gave up the Amorites before the children of Israel , and he said in the sight of Israel , Sun , stand still upon Gibeon ; And thou , moon , in the valley of Ajalon !
DARBY	Joshua	10	13	And the sun stood still , and the moon remained where it was , until the nation had avenged themselves upon their enemies . Is not this written in the book of Jasher ? And the sun remained standing in the midst of heaven , and hasted not to go down about a full day .
DARBY	Joshua	10	14	And there was no day like that before it or after it , that Jehovah hearkened to the voice of a man ; for Jehovah fought for Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	10	15	And Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , to the camp , to Gilgal .
DARBY	Joshua	10	16	And these five kings fled , and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah .
DARBY	Joshua	10	17	And it was told Joshua , saying , The five kings have been found , hid in the cave at Makkedah .
DARBY	Joshua	10	18	And Joshua said , Roll great stones before the mouth of the cave , and set men before it to keep them .
DARBY	Joshua	10	19	And ye , stay not , pursue after your enemies , and smite the hindmost of them ; suffer them not to enter into their cities ; for Jehovah your God has given them into your hand .
DARBY	Joshua	10	20	And it came to pass when Joshua and the children of Israel had ended smiting them with a very great slaughter , until they were consumed , that the remnant which remained of them entered into fortified cities ;
DARBY	Joshua	10	21	and all the people returned to the camp to Joshua , at Makkedah , in peace ; none moved his tongue against the children of Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	10	22	And Joshua said , Open the mouth of the cave , and bring forth to me those five kings out of the cave .
DARBY	Joshua	10	23	And they did so , and brought forth to him those five kings out of the cave , the king of Jerusalem , the king of Hebron , the king of Jarmuth , the king of Lachish , the king of Eglon .
DARBY	Joshua	10	24	And it came to pass when they had brought forth those kings to Joshua , that Joshua called to all the men of Israel , and said to the captains of the men of war who went with him , Come forward , put your feet on the necks of these kings . And they came forward and put their feet on their necks .
DARBY	Joshua	10	25	And Joshua said to them , Fear not , neither be dismayed ; be strong and courageous , for thus will Jehovah do to all your enemies against whom ye fight .
DARBY	Joshua	10	26	And afterwards Joshua smote them , and put them to death , and hanged them on five trees ; and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening .
DARBY	Joshua	10	27	And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun , that Joshua commanded , and they took them down off the trees , and cast them into the cave where they had been hid , and laid great stones before the cave 's mouth , [ which remain ] to this very day .
DARBY	Joshua	10	28	And Joshua took Makkedah on that day , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof , him and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed ; he let none remain ; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho .
DARBY	Joshua	10	29	And Joshua passed , and all Israel with him , from Makkedah to Libnah , and fought against Libnah .
DARBY	Joshua	10	30	And Jehovah gave it also and the king thereof into the hand of Israel ; and he smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein ; he let none remain in it : and he did to the king thereof as he had done to the king of Jericho .
DARBY	Joshua	10	31	And Joshua passed , and all Israel with him , from Libnah to Lachish , and encamped against it , and fought against it .
DARBY	Joshua	10	32	And Jehovah gave Lachish into the hand of Israel ; and they took it on the second day , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein , according to all that he had done to Libnah .
DARBY	Joshua	10	33	Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish ; and Joshua smote him and his people , until he had left him none remaining .
DARBY	Joshua	10	34	And Joshua , and all Israel with him , passed from Lachish to Eglon ; and they encamped against it , and fought against it .
DARBY	Joshua	10	35	And they took it on that day , and smote it with the edge of the sword ; and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed on that day , according to all that he had done to Lachish .
DARBY	Joshua	10	36	And Joshua went up , and all Israel with him , from Eglon to Hebron ; and they fought against it .
DARBY	Joshua	10	37	And they took it , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof , and all the cities thereof , and all the souls that were therein : he let none remain , according to all that he had done to Eglon ; and he utterly destroyed it , and all the souls that were therein .
DARBY	Joshua	10	38	And Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , to Debir ; and fought against it .
DARBY	Joshua	10	39	And he took it , and the king thereof , and all the cities thereof , and they smote them with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein ; he let none remain : as he had done to Hebron , and as he had done to Libnah , and to the king thereof , so he did to Debir and to the king thereof .
DARBY	Joshua	10	40	And Joshua smote the whole country , the mountain , and the south , and the lowland , and the hill-slopes , and all their kings : he let none remain , but he utterly destroyed all that breathed , as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded .
DARBY	Joshua	10	41	And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gazah , and all the country of Goshen , even to Gibeon ;
DARBY	Joshua	10	42	and all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time ; for Jehovah the God of Israel fought for Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	10	43	And Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , to the camp , to Gilgal .
DARBY	Joshua	11	11	And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword , destroying them utterly : there was not any left to breathe ; and he burned Hazor with fire .
DARBY	Joshua	11	2	and to the kings that were northward in the mountains , and in the plain south of Chinneroth , and in the lowland , and on the upland of Dor on the west ,
DARBY	Joshua	11	3	to the Canaanite on the east and on the west , and to the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Jebusite in the mountains , and to the Hivite at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpah .
DARBY	Joshua	11	4	And they went out , they and all their armies with them , a people numerous as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude , with horses and chariots very many .
DARBY	Joshua	11	5	And all these kings met together , and came and encamped together at the waters of Merom , to fight against Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	11	6	And Jehovah said to Joshua , Be not afraid because of them ; for to-morrow about this time will I give them all up slain before Israel : their horses shalt thou hough , and thou shalt burn their chariots with fire .
DARBY	Joshua	11	7	And Joshua , and all the people of war with him , came upon them by the waters of Merom suddenly , and fell upon them .
DARBY	Joshua	11	8	And Jehovah delivered them into the hand of Israel , and they smote them , and chased them unto great Zidon , and to Misrephoth-maim , and to the valley of Mizpah eastward , and smote them until none were left remaining to them .
DARBY	Joshua	11	9	And Joshua did to them as Jehovah had said to him : he houghed their horses , and burned their chariots with fire .
DARBY	Joshua	11	10	And Joshua turned back at that time , and took Hazor , and smote the king thereof with the sword ; for Hazor was in times past the head of all those kingdoms .
DARBY	Joshua	11	12	And all the cities of those kings and all their kings did Joshua take ; and he smote them with the edge of the sword , destroying them utterly , as Moses the servant of Jehovah had commanded .
DARBY	Joshua	11	13	Only , all the cities that stood still upon their hills Israel did not burn , save Hazor alone , [ which ] Joshua burned .
DARBY	Joshua	11	14	And all the spoil of these cities and the cattle the children of Israel took as prey to themselves ; only , they smote all the men with the edge of the sword , until they had destroyed them : they left none that breathed .
DARBY	Joshua	11	15	As Jehovah had commanded Moses his servant , so did Moses command Joshua , and so did Joshua : he let nothing fail of all that Jehovah had commanded Moses .
DARBY	Joshua	11	16	And Joshua took all that land , the mountain and all the south , and all the land of Goshen , and the lowland , and the plain , and the mountain of Israel , and its lowland ;
DARBY	Joshua	11	17	from the smooth mountain , which rises toward Seir , as far as Baal-Gad in the valley of Lebanon , at the foot of mount Hermon ; and he took all their kings , and smote them , and put them to death .
DARBY	Joshua	11	18	Joshua made war a long time with all those kings .
DARBY	Joshua	11	19	There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel , save the Hivites who dwelt at Gibeon ; they took all in battle .
DARBY	Joshua	11	20	For it was of Jehovah that their heart was hardened , to meet Israel in battle , that they might be utterly destroyed , and that there might be no favour shewn to them , but that they might be destroyed , as Jehovah had commanded Moses .
DARBY	Joshua	11	21	And Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the mountains , from Hebron , from Debir , from Anab , and from all the mountain of Judah , and from all the mountain of Israel : Joshua destroyed them utterly , with their cities .
DARBY	Joshua	11	22	There were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel ; only at Gazah , at Gath , and at Ashdod there remained .
DARBY	Joshua	11	23	And Joshua took the whole land , according to all that Jehovah had said to Moses ; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions , by their tribes . And the land rested from war .
DARBY	Joshua	12	12	the king of Eglon , one ; the king of Gezer , one ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	2	Sihon the king of the Amorites , who dwelt at Heshbon , [ and ] ruled from Aroer , which is upon the bank of the river Arnon , and from the middle of the ravine , and over half Gilead , as far as the river Jabbok , [ which is ] the border of the children of Ammon ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	3	and the plain as far as the sea of Chinneroth on the east , and as far as the sea of the plain , the salt sea , on the east , toward Beth-jeshimoth ; and on the south , under the slopes of Pisgah ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	4	and the territory of Og the king of Bashan , of the residue of the giants , who dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei ,
DARBY	Joshua	12	5	and ruled over mount Hermon , and over Salcah , and over all Bashan , as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites , and [ over ] half Gilead [ as far as ] the border of Sihon the king of Heshbon .
DARBY	Joshua	12	6	Moses the servant of Jehovah and the children of Israel smote them , and Moses the servant of Jehovah gave it for a possession to the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to half the tribe of Manasseh .
DARBY	Joshua	12	7	And these are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side the Jordan on the west , from Baal-Gad in the valley of Lebanon as far as the smooth mountain , which rises toward Seir . And Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions ,
DARBY	Joshua	12	8	in the mountain , and in the lowland , and in the plain , and on the hill-slopes , and in the wilderness , and in the south : the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Canaanites , the Perizzites , the Hivites and the Jebusites :
DARBY	Joshua	12	9	The king of Jericho , one ; the king of Ai , which is beside Bethel , one ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	10	the king of Jerusalem , one ; the king of Hebron , one ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	11	the king of Jarmuth , one ; the king of Lachish , one ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	13	the king of Debir , one ; the king of Geder , one ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	14	the king of Hormah , one ; the king of Arad , one ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	15	the king of Libnah , one ; the king of Adullam , one ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	16	the king of Makkedah , one ; the king of Bethel , one ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	17	the king of Tappuah , one ; the king of Hepher , one ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	18	the king of Aphek , one ; the king of Lasharon , one ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	19	the king of Madon , one ; the king of Hazor , one ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	20	the king of Shimron-meron , one ; the king of Achshaph , one ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	21	the king of Taanach , one ; the king of Megiddo , one ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	22	the king of Kedesh , one ; the king of Jokneam on Carmel , one ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	23	the king of Dor in the upland of Dor , one ; the king of Goim , at Gilgal , one ;
DARBY	Joshua	12	24	the king of Tirzah , one : all the kings thirty and one .
DARBY	Joshua	13	13	But the children of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurites nor the Maachathites ; but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites to this day .
DARBY	Joshua	13	2	This is the land that yet remaineth : all the districts of the Philistines and all the Geshurites ,
DARBY	Joshua	13	3	from the Shihor , which [ floweth ] before Egypt , as far as the borders of Ekron northward , [ and which ] is counted to the Canaanite ; five lordships of the Philistines : of Gazah , and of Ashdod , of Eshkalon , of Gath , and of Ekron ; also the Avvites ;
DARBY	Joshua	13	4	in the south , the whole land of the Canaanites , and Mearah which [ belongeth ] to the Sidonians , unto Aphek , to the border of the Amorites ;
DARBY	Joshua	13	5	and the land of the Giblites , and all Lebanon , toward the sun-rising , from Baal-Gad at the foot of mount Hermon to the entrance into Hamath ;
DARBY	Joshua	13	6	all the inhabitants of the hill-country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim , all the Sidonians ; I will dispossess them from before the children of Israel . Only , partition it by lot to Israel for an inheritance , as I have commanded thee .
DARBY	Joshua	13	7	And now divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes , and to half the tribe of Manasseh ;
DARBY	Joshua	13	8	with him the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance , which Moses gave them , beyond the Jordan eastward , as Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them :
DARBY	Joshua	13	9	from Aroer , which is on the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the ravine , and all the plateau of Medeba to Dibon ,
DARBY	Joshua	13	10	and all the cities of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who reigned at Heshbon , to the border of the children of Ammon ;
DARBY	Joshua	13	11	and Gilead , and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites , and all mount Hermon , and the whole of Bashan to Salcah ;
DARBY	Joshua	13	12	all the kingdom of Og in Bashan , who reigned at Ashtaroth and at Edrei , who remained of the residue of the giants ; and Moses smote them and dispossessed them .
DARBY	Joshua	13	14	Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance : the offerings by fire of Jehovah the God of Israel are their inheritance , as he said to them .
DARBY	Joshua	13	15	And Moses gave [ a portion ] to the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their families .
DARBY	Joshua	13	16	And their territory was from Aroer , which is on the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the ravine , and all the plateau by Medeba ;
DARBY	Joshua	13	17	Heshbon , and all her cities that are in the plateau , Dibon , and Bamoth-Baal , and Beth-Baal-meon ,
DARBY	Joshua	13	18	And Jahzah , and Kedemoth , and Mephaath ,
DARBY	Joshua	13	19	and Kirjathaim , and Sibmah , and Zereth-shahar in the mountain of the vale ,
DARBY	Joshua	13	20	and Beth-Peor , and the slopes of Pisgah , and Beth-jeshimoth ;
DARBY	Joshua	13	21	all the cities of the plateau , and the whole kingdom of Sihon the king of the Amorites , who reigned at Heshbon , whom Moses smote , him and the princes of Midian , Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , the chiefs of Sihon dwelling in the land .
DARBY	Joshua	13	22	And Balaam the son of Beor , the diviner , did the children of Israel kill with the sword among them that were slain by them .
DARBY	Joshua	13	23	And the border of the children of Reuben was the Jordan , and [ its ] border . This is the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families , the cities and their hamlets .
DARBY	Joshua	13	24	And Moses gave [ a portion ] to the tribe of Gad , to the children of Gad according to their families .
DARBY	Joshua	13	25	And their territory was Jaazer , and all the cities of Gilead , and half the land of the children of Ammon , to Aroer which is before Rabbah ;
DARBY	Joshua	13	26	and from Heshbon to Ramath-Mizpeh , and Betonim ; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir ;
DARBY	Joshua	13	27	and in the valley , Beth-haram , and Beth-Nimrah , and Succoth , and Zaphon , the rest of the kingdom of Sihon the king of Heshbon , the Jordan and [ its ] border , as far as the edge of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward .
DARBY	Joshua	13	28	This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families , the cities and their hamlets .
DARBY	Joshua	13	29	And Moses gave [ a portion ] to half the tribe of Manasseh ; and for half the tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families :
DARBY	Joshua	13	30	their territory was from Mahanaim , all Bashan , the whole kingdom of Og the king of Bashan , and all the villages of Jair , which are in Bashan , sixty cities .
DARBY	Joshua	13	31	And half Gilead , and Ashtaroth , and Edrei , the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan , [ belonged ] to the children of Machir the son of Manasseh , to the one half of the children of Machir according to their families .
DARBY	Joshua	13	32	This is that which Moses allotted for inheritance in the plains of Moab , beyond the Jordan of Jericho , eastward .
DARBY	Joshua	13	33	But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance : Jehovah the God of Israel is their inheritance , as he said to them .
DARBY	Joshua	14	14	Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day , because he wholly followed Jehovah the God of Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	14	2	their inheritance was by lot , as Jehovah had commanded by Moses , for the nine tribes , and the half tribe .
DARBY	Joshua	14	3	For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half tribe beyond the Jordan , but to the Levites he had given no inheritance among them .
DARBY	Joshua	14	4	For the children of Joseph were two tribes , Manasseh and Ephraim ; and they gave no part to the Levites in the land , save cities to dwell in , and their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance .
DARBY	Joshua	14	5	As Jehovah had commanded Moses , so the children of Israel did , and they divided the land .
DARBY	Joshua	14	6	Then the children of Judah came near to Joshua in Gilgal , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him , Thou knowest the word that Jehovah spoke to Moses the man of God , concerning me and thee , in Kadesh-barnea .
DARBY	Joshua	14	7	Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Jehovah sent me from Kadesh-barnea to search out the land ; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart .
DARBY	Joshua	14	8	And my brethren that had gone up with me made the heart of the people melt ; but I wholly followed Jehovah my God .
DARBY	Joshua	14	9	And Moses swore on that day , saying , The land whereon thy feet have trodden shall assuredly be thine inheritance , and thy children 's for ever ! for thou hast wholly followed Jehovah my God .
DARBY	Joshua	14	10	And now behold , Jehovah has kept me alive , as he said , these forty-five years , since Jehovah spoke this word to Moses , when Israel wandered in the wilderness ; and now behold , I am this day eighty-five years old .
DARBY	Joshua	14	11	I am still this day strong , as in the day that Moses sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now , for war , both to go out and to come in .
DARBY	Joshua	14	12	And now give me this mountain , of which Jehovah spoke in that day ; for thou heardest in that day that Anakim are there , and great fortified cities . If so be Jehovah shall be with me , then I shall dispossess them , as Jehovah said .
DARBY	Joshua	14	13	And Joshua blessed him , and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance .
DARBY	Joshua	14	15	Now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-Arba ; the great man among the Anakim . And the land rested from war .
DARBY	Joshua	15	15	And from there he went up against the inhabitants of Debir ; now the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher .
DARBY	Joshua	15	2	And their southern border was from the end of the salt sea , from the tongue that turns southward ;
DARBY	Joshua	15	3	and it went out south of the ascent of Akrabbim , and passed on to Zin , and went up on the south of Kadesh-barnea , and passed to Hezron , and went up toward Addar , and turned toward Karkaah ,
DARBY	Joshua	15	4	and passed on to Azmon , and went out by the torrent of Egypt ; and the border ended at the sea . That shall be your border southward .
DARBY	Joshua	15	5	—And the eastern border was the salt sea as far as the end of the Jordan.—And the border on the north side was from the tongue of the salt sea , at the end of the Jordan ;
DARBY	Joshua	15	6	and the border went up toward Beth-hoglah , and passed north of Beth-Arabah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan , the son of Reuben ;
DARBY	Joshua	15	7	and the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor , and turned northward to Gilgal , which is opposite to the ascent of Adummim , which is on the south side of the torrent ; and the border passed to the waters of En-shemesh , and ended at En-rogel ;
DARBY	Joshua	15	8	and the border went up to the valley of the son of Hinnom , toward the south side of the Jebusite , that is , Jerusalem ; and the border went up to the top of the mountain that is before the valley of Hinnom westward , which is at the end of the valley of Rephaim northward ;
DARBY	Joshua	15	9	and the border reached along from the top of the mountain toward the spring of the waters of Nephtoah , and went out toward the cities of mount Ephron ; and the border reached along to Baalah , that is , Kirjath-jearim ;
DARBY	Joshua	15	10	and the border turned from Baalah westwards toward mount Seir , and passed toward the side of Har-jearim , that is , Chesalon , northwards , and went down to Beth-shemesh , and passed Timnah .
DARBY	Joshua	15	11	And the border went out to the side of Ekron northwards , and the border reached along toward Shicron , and passed mount Baalah , and went toward Jabneel ; and the border ended at the sea .
DARBY	Joshua	15	12	—And the west border is the great sea and [ its ] coast . This is the border of the children of Judah round about , according to their families .
DARBY	Joshua	15	13	And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children of Judah according to the commandment of Jehovah to Joshua , the city of Arba , the father of Anak , that is , Hebron .
DARBY	Joshua	15	14	And thence Caleb dispossessed the three sons of Anak , Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai , who were born of Anak .
DARBY	Joshua	15	16	And Caleb said , He that smites Kirjath-sepher and takes it , to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife .
DARBY	Joshua	15	17	And Othniel the son of Kenaz , the brother of Caleb , took it ; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife .
DARBY	Joshua	15	18	And it came to pass as she came , that she urged him to ask of her father a field ; and she sprang down from the ass . And Caleb said to her , What wouldest thou ?
DARBY	Joshua	15	19	And she said , Give me a blessing ; for thou hast given me a southern land ; give me also springs of water . Then he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .
DARBY	Joshua	15	20	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families .
DARBY	Joshua	15	21	The cities at the extremity of the tribe of the children of Judah , toward the border of Edom in the south , were : Kabzeel , and Eder , and Jagur ,
DARBY	Joshua	15	22	and Kinah , and Dimonah , and Adadah ,

DARBY	Joshua	16	8	From Tappuah the border went westwards to the torrent Kanah , and ended at the sea . This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim according to their families ,
DARBY	Joshua	16	9	with the cities that were set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh , all the cities and their hamlets .
DARBY	Joshua	16	10	But they did not dispossess the Canaanites that dwelt at Gezer ; and the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to this day , and serve under tribute .
DARBY	Joshua	17	17	And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph , to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , Thou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only ,
DARBY	Joshua	17	2	There was also [ a portion ] for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families : for the children of Abiezer , and for the children of Helek , and for the children of Asriel , and for the children of Shechem , and for the children of Hepher , and for the children of Shemida : these are the children of Manasseh , the son of Joseph , the males , according to their families .

DARBY	Joshua	17	4	And they came near before Eleazar the priest , and before Joshua the son of Nun , and before the princes , saying , Jehovah commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren .

DARBY	Joshua	17	10	Southward it was Ephraim 's , and northward it was Manasseh 's , and the sea was his border . And they touched upon Asher on the north , and upon Issachar on the east .

DARBY	Joshua	17	13	And it came to pass when the children of Israel were become strong , that they made the Canaanites tributary ; but they did not utterly dispossess them .
DARBY	Joshua	17	14	And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua , saying , Why hast thou given me as inheritance one lot and one portion , seeing I am a great people , forasmuch as Jehovah has blessed me hitherto ?
DARBY	Joshua	17	15	And Joshua said unto them , If thou art a great people , then get thee up to the wood , and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants , if the hill-country of Ephraim is too narrow for thee .
DARBY	Joshua	17	16	And the children of Joseph said , The hill-country will not be enough for us ; and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron , those that are of Beth-shean and its dependent villages , and those that are in the valley of Jizreel .
DARBY	Joshua	17	18	but the hill-country shall be thine , as it is a wood , thou shalt cut it down , and its outgoings shall be thine ; for thou shalt dispossess the Canaanites , though they have iron chariots ; for they are powerful .
DARBY	Joshua	18	18	and passed along towards the side opposite to Arabah northwards , and went down to Arabah ;
DARBY	Joshua	18	2	And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes whose inheritance had not been distributed to them .
DARBY	Joshua	18	3	And Joshua said to the children of Israel , How long will ye shew yourselves slack to go to take possession of the land which Jehovah the God of your fathers hath given you ?
DARBY	Joshua	18	4	Provide you three men for a tribe ; that I may send them , and they shall rise and go through the land , and describe it according to the proportion of their inheritance , and they shall come to me .
DARBY	Joshua	18	5	And they shall divide it into seven portions . Judah shall remain in their border on the south , and the house of Joseph shall remain in their border on the north ;
DARBY	Joshua	18	6	and * ye * shall describe the land into seven portions , and bring [ the description ] hither to me , and I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah our God .
DARBY	Joshua	18	7	But the Levites have no portion among you , for the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance . And Gad , and Reuben , and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan on the east , which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave them .
DARBY	Joshua	18	8	And the men arose and went away . And Joshua charged them that went to describe the land , saying , Go and walk through the land , and describe it , and come again to me , and I will cast lots for you here before Jehovah in Shiloh .
DARBY	Joshua	18	9	And the men went and passed through the land , and described it by cities into seven portions , in a book , and they came to Joshua , to the camp at Shiloh .
DARBY	Joshua	18	10	And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Jehovah . And there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions .

DARBY	Joshua	21	41	All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities and their suburbs .
DARBY	Joshua	21	42	Each one of these cities had its suburbs round about it : thus were all these cities .
DARBY	Joshua	21	43	And Jehovah gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give unto their fathers ; and they took possession of it , and dwelt in it .
DARBY	Joshua	21	44	And Jehovah gave them rest round about , according to all that he had sworn unto their fathers ; and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them : Jehovah gave all their enemies into their hand .
DARBY	Joshua	21	45	There failed nothing of all the good things that Jehovah had spoken to the house of Israel : all came to pass .
DARBY	Joshua	22	22	The God of gods , Jehovah , the God of gods , Jehovah , he knoweth , and Israel he shall know [ it ] ; if it is in rebellion , or if in trespass against Jehovah , —save us not this day !
DARBY	Joshua	22	2	and said unto them , Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you , and have hearkened to my voice in all that I commanded you .
DARBY	Joshua	22	3	Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day , and ye have kept the charge of the commandment of Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Joshua	22	4	And now Jehovah your God hath given rest to your brethren , as he said unto them ; and now return , and get you unto your tents , unto the land of your possession , which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave you beyond the Jordan .
DARBY	Joshua	22	5	Only , take great heed to do the commandment and the law , which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you , to love Jehovah your God , and to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and to cleave unto him , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul .
DARBY	Joshua	22	6	And Joshua blessed them , and sent them away ; and they went to their tents .
DARBY	Joshua	22	7	And to half the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given [ inheritance ] in Bashan , and to the other half thereof had Joshua given among their brethren on this side the Jordan westward . And when Joshua sent them away to their tents , he blessed them also ,
DARBY	Joshua	22	8	and spoke to them , saying , Return unto your tents with much wealth and with very much cattle , with silver , and with gold , and with copper , and with iron , and with clothing , in very great quantity ; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren .
DARBY	Joshua	22	9	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned , and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan , to go to the country of Gilead , into the land of their possession , of which they had become possessed , according to the word of Jehovah through Moses .
DARBY	Joshua	22	10	And they came to the districts of the Jordan that are in the land of Canaan ; and the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan , an altar of grand appearance .
DARBY	Joshua	22	11	And the children of Israel heard say , Behold , the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan , in the districts of the Jordan , separately from the children of Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	22	12	And when the children of Israel heard [ of it ] , the whole assembly of the children of Israel gathered together at Shiloh , to go up against them to war .
DARBY	Joshua	22	13	And the children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half tribe of Manasseh , into the land of Gilead , Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest ,
DARBY	Joshua	22	14	and with him ten princes , of each father 's house a prince , out of all the tribes of Israel ; and each of them was head of a father 's house , of the thousands of Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	22	15	And they came to the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the half tribe of Manasseh , to the land of Gilead , and spoke with them , saying ,
DARBY	Joshua	22	16	Thus saith the whole assembly of Jehovah : What wickedness is this which ye have committed against the God of Israel , to turn away this day from following Jehovah , in that ye have built yourselves an altar , rebelling this day against Jehovah ?
DARBY	Joshua	22	17	Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us ? from which we are not cleansed until this day , although there was a plague in the assembly of Jehovah .
DARBY	Joshua	22	18	And ye turn away this day from following Jehovah ; and it will be , that since ye rebel this day against Jehovah , to-morrow he will be wroth with the whole assembly of Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	22	19	Notwithstanding , if the land of your possession is unclean , come over into the land of the possession of Jehovah , where Jehovah 's tabernacle dwelleth , and take possession amongst us ; but rebel not against Jehovah , and rebel not against us , in building for yourselves an altar besides the altar of Jehovah our God .
DARBY	Joshua	22	20	Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing ? and wrath fell on all the assembly of Israel , and he perished not alone in his iniquity .
DARBY	Joshua	22	21	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered and said to the heads of the thousands of Israel ,
DARBY	Joshua	22	23	—that we have built for ourselves an altar to turn from following Jehovah , and if it is to offer up burnt-offering and oblation on it , and if to offer peace-offerings thereon , let Jehovah himself require it [ from us ] ;
DARBY	Joshua	22	24	and if we have not done it from fear of this thing , saying , In future your children will speak to our children , saying , What have ye to do with Jehovah the God of Israel ?
DARBY	Joshua	22	25	Jehovah hath made the Jordan a border between us and you , ye children of Reuben and children of Gad , ye have no portion in Jehovah ! And so shall your children make our children cease from fearing Jehovah .
DARBY	Joshua	22	26	And we said , Let us now set to work to build an altar , not for burnt-offering , nor for sacrifice ,
DARBY	Joshua	22	27	but to be a witness between us and you , and between our generations after us , that we might do service to Jehovah before him with our burnt-offerings , and with our sacrifices , and with our peace-offerings ; that your children may not say to our children in future , Ye have no portion in Jehovah .
DARBY	Joshua	22	28	And we said , If it shall be that in future they so say to us and to our generations , we will say , Behold the pattern of the altar of Jehovah which our fathers made , not for burnt-offering , nor for sacrifice , but as a witness between us and you .
DARBY	Joshua	22	29	Far be it from us that we should rebel against Jehovah , and turn this day from following Jehovah , in building an altar for burnt-offering , for oblation , and for sacrifice , besides the altar of Jehovah our God that is before his tabernacle .
DARBY	Joshua	22	30	And when Phinehas the priest and the princes of the assembly and the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke , it was good in their sight .
DARBY	Joshua	22	31	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben , and to the children of Gad , and to the children of Manasseh , This day we perceive that Jehovah is among us , because ye have not committed this trespass against Jehovah : now have ye delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Jehovah .
DARBY	Joshua	22	32	And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , and the princes , returned from the children of Reuben , and from the children of Gad , out of the land of Gilead , to the land of Canaan , to the children of Israel , and brought them word again .
DARBY	Joshua	22	33	And the thing was good in the sight of the children of Israel , and the children of Israel blessed God , and no more said that they would go up in warfare against them , to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad dwelt .
DARBY	Joshua	22	34	And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad gave a name to the altar ; for it is a witness between us that Jehovah is God .
DARBY	Joshua	23	23	And it came to pass a long time after that Jehovah had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about , and Joshua had become old , advanced in age ,
DARBY	Joshua	23	2	that Joshua called for all Israel , for their elders , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers , and said unto them , I am become old , advanced in age ;
DARBY	Joshua	23	3	and ye have seen all that Jehovah your God hath done to all these nations because of you . For Jehovah your God is he that hath fought for you .
DARBY	Joshua	23	4	Behold , I have divided unto you by lot for an inheritance , according to your tribes , these nations that remain , from the Jordan , as well as all the nations that I have cut off , as far as the great sea toward the sun-setting .
DARBY	Joshua	23	5	And Jehovah your God , he will expel them from before you , and dispossess them from out of your sight ; and ye shall take possession of their land , as Jehovah your God hath said unto you .
DARBY	Joshua	23	6	And be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses , that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left ;
DARBY	Joshua	23	7	that ye enter not among these nations , these that remain among you ; and ye shall make no mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear [ by them ] , neither serve them , nor bow yourselves unto them ;
DARBY	Joshua	23	8	but ye shall cleave unto Jehovah your God , as ye have done unto this day .
DARBY	Joshua	23	9	For Jehovah hath dispossessed from before you great and strong nations ; and as to you , no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day .
DARBY	Joshua	23	10	One man of you chaseth a thousand ; for Jehovah your God , he it is that fighteth for you , as he hath said unto you .
DARBY	Joshua	23	11	Take great heed therefore unto your souls , that ye love Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Joshua	23	12	For if ye in any wise go back , and cleave unto the residue of these nations , these that remain among you , and make marriages with them , and come in unto them and they unto you :
DARBY	Joshua	23	13	know for a certainty that Jehovah your God will no more dispossess these nations from before you , and they shall be snares and traps unto you , and scourges in your sides , and thorns in your eyes , until ye perish from off this good land which Jehovah your God hath given you .
DARBY	Joshua	23	14	And behold , I am going this day the way of all the earth ; and ye know in all your heart , and in all your soul , that not one thing hath failed of all the good words that Jehovah your God hath spoken concerning you : all are come to pass unto you—not one thing hath failed thereof .
DARBY	Joshua	23	15	But it shall come to pass , that as every good word hath been fulfilled to you , that Jehovah your God spoke to you , so will Jehovah bring upon you every evil word , until he have destroyed you from off this good land which Jehovah your God hath given you ;
DARBY	Joshua	23	16	when ye transgress the covenant of Jehovah your God which he commanded you , and go and serve other gods , and bow yourselves unto them , so that the anger of Jehovah shall be kindled against you , and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you .
DARBY	Joshua	24	24	And the people said unto Joshua , Jehovah our God will we serve , and to his voice will we hearken .
DARBY	Joshua	24	2	And Joshua said unto all the people , Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel : Your fathers dwelt of old on the other side of the river , Terah , the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor , and they served other gods .
DARBY	Joshua	24	3	And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the river , and led him throughout the land of Canaan , and multiplied his seed and gave him Isaac .
DARBY	Joshua	24	4	And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau ; and I gave unto Esau mount Seir , to possess it ; and Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt .
DARBY	Joshua	24	5	And I sent Moses and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did among them ; and afterwards I brought you out .
DARBY	Joshua	24	6	And I brought your fathers out of Egypt , and ye came unto the sea ; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea .
DARBY	Joshua	24	7	Then they cried to Jehovah , and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians , and brought the sea upon them , and covered them ; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt ; and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long time .
DARBY	Joshua	24	8	And I brought you into the land of the Amorites , who dwelt beyond the Jordan , and they fought with you , and I gave them into your hand , and ye took possession of their land , and I destroyed them from before you .
DARBY	Joshua	24	9	And Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , arose and warred against Israel , and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you ;
DARBY	Joshua	24	10	but I would not hearken unto Balaam , and he blessed you expressly , and I delivered you out of his hand .
DARBY	Joshua	24	11	And ye went over the Jordan , and came unto Jericho , and the men of Jericho fought against you , the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Girgashites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; and I delivered them into your hand .
DARBY	Joshua	24	12	And I sent the hornet before you , which drove them out from before you , [ as ] the two kings of the Amorites ; not with thy sword , nor with thy bow .
DARBY	Joshua	24	13	And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour , and cities which ye built not , and ye dwell in them ; of vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat .
DARBY	Joshua	24	14	And now fear Jehovah and serve him in perfectness and in truth ; and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the river , and in Egypt ; and serve Jehovah .
DARBY	Joshua	24	15	And if it seem evil unto you to serve Jehovah , choose you this day whom ye will serve ; whether the gods whom your fathers that were on the other side of the river served , or the gods of the Amorite , in whose land ye dwell ; but as for me and my house , we will serve Jehovah .
DARBY	Joshua	24	16	And the people answered and said , Far be it from us that we should forsake Jehovah , to serve other gods ;
DARBY	Joshua	24	17	for Jehovah our God , he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage , and who did those great signs before our eyes , and preserved us in all the way wherein we went , and among all the peoples through whom we passed !
DARBY	Joshua	24	18	And Jehovah drove out from before us all the peoples , and the Amorites the inhabitants of the land : so therefore we will serve Jehovah , for he is our God .
DARBY	Joshua	24	19	And Joshua said to the people , Ye can not serve Jehovah , for he is a holy God ; he is a jealous God ; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins .
DARBY	Joshua	24	20	If ye forsake Jehovah , and serve strange gods , then he will turn and do you hurt , and consume you , after that he hath done you good .
DARBY	Joshua	24	21	And the people said to Joshua , No ; but we will serve Jehovah .
DARBY	Joshua	24	22	And Joshua said unto the people , Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you Jehovah , to serve him . And they said , [ We are ] witnesses .
DARBY	Joshua	24	23	Now therefore put away the strange gods that are among you , and incline your heart unto Jehovah the God of Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	24	25	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day , and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem .
DARBY	Joshua	24	26	And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God , and took a great stone , and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Jehovah .
DARBY	Joshua	24	27	And Joshua said unto all the people , Behold , this stone shall be a witness unto us , for it hath heard all the words of Jehovah which he spoke unto us ; and it shall be a witness against you , lest ye deny your God .
DARBY	Joshua	24	28	And Joshua dismissed the people , every man to his inheritance .
DARBY	Joshua	24	29	And it came to pass after these things , that Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of Jehovah , died , a hundred and ten years old .
DARBY	Joshua	24	30	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah , which is in mount Ephraim , on the north side of the mountain of Gaash .
DARBY	Joshua	24	31	And Israel served Jehovah all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders whose days were prolonged after Joshua , and who had known all the works of Jehovah , which he had done for Israel .
DARBY	Joshua	24	32	And the bones of Joseph , which the children of Israel had brought up out of Egypt , buried they in Shechem in the portion of the field which Jacob had bought of the sons of Hamor , Shechem 's father , for a hundred kesitahs ; and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph .
DARBY	Joshua	24	33	And Eleazar the son of Aaron died ; and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son , which had been given him in mount Ephraim .
DARBY	Judges	1	1	And it came to pass after the death of Joshua that the children of Israel asked Jehovah , saying , Which of us shall go up against the Canaanites first , to fight against them ?
DARBY	Judges	1	2	And Jehovah said , Judah shall go up : behold , I have delivered the land into his hand .
DARBY	Judges	1	3	And Judah said to Simeon his brother , Come up with me into my lot , and let us fight against the Canaanites , and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot ; and Simeon went with him .
DARBY	Judges	1	4	And Judah went up ; and Jehovah delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand , and they smote them in Bezek , ten thousand men .
DARBY	Judges	1	5	And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek , and fought against him , and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites .
DARBY	Judges	1	6	And Adoni-Bezek fled , and they pursued after him , and caught him , and cut off his thumbs and his great toes .
DARBY	Judges	1	7	And Adoni-Bezek said , Seventy kings , with their thumbs and their great toes cut off , gleaned under my table : as I have done , so God has requited me . And they brought him to Jerusalem , and there he died .
DARBY	Judges	1	8	And the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem , and took it , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and set the city on fire .
DARBY	Judges	1	9	And afterwards the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites , that dwelt in the hill-country , and in the south , and in the lowland .
DARBY	Judges	1	10	And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron—the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-Arba ; and they slew Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai .
DARBY	Judges	1	11	And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir ; now the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher .
DARBY	Judges	1	12	And Caleb said , He that smites Kirjath-sepher and takes it , to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife .
DARBY	Judges	1	13	And Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother , took it ; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife .
DARBY	Judges	1	14	And it came to pass as she came , that she urged him to ask of her father the field ; and she sprang down from the ass . And Caleb said to her , What wouldest thou ?
DARBY	Judges	1	15	And she said to him , Give me a blessing ; for thou hast given me a southern land ; give me also springs of water . And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .
DARBY	Judges	1	16	And the children of the Kenite , Moses ' father-in-law , had gone up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah , which is in the south of Arad ; and they went and dwelt with the people .
DARBY	Judges	1	17	And Judah went with Simeon his brother , and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath , and utterly destroyed it ; and they called the name of the city Hormah .
DARBY	Judges	1	18	And Judah took Gazah and its border , and Ashkelon and its border , and Ekron and its border .
DARBY	Judges	1	19	And Jehovah was with Judah ; and he took possession of the hill-country , for he did not dispossess the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
DARBY	Judges	1	20	And they gave to Caleb Hebron , as Moses had said ; and he dispossessed from thence the three sons of Anak .
DARBY	Judges	1	21	And the children of Benjamin did not dispossess the Jebusites , the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day .
DARBY	Judges	1	22	And the house of Joseph , they also went up against Bethel ; and Jehovah was with them .
DARBY	Judges	1	23	And the house of Joseph sent to search out Bethel ; now the name of the city before was Luz .
DARBY	Judges	1	24	And the guards saw a man come forth out of the city , and said unto him , Shew us , we pray thee , how [ we ] may enter into the city , and we will shew thee kindness .
DARBY	Judges	1	25	And he shewed them how to enter into the city . And they smote the city with the edge of the sword ; but they let go the man and all his family .
DARBY	Judges	1	26	And the man went into the land of the Hittites , and built a city , and called its name Luz , which is its name to this day .
DARBY	Judges	1	27	And Manasseh did not dispossess Beth-shean and its dependent villages , nor Taanach and its dependent villages , nor the inhabitants of Dor and its dependent villages , nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its dependent villages , nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its dependent villages ; and the Canaanites would dwell in that land .
DARBY	Judges	1	28	And it came to pass when Israel became strong , that they made the Canaanites tributary ; but they did not utterly dispossess them .
DARBY	Judges	1	29	And Ephraim did not dispossess the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer ; but the Canaanites dwelt among them in Gezer .
DARBY	Judges	1	30	Zebulun did not dispossess the inhabitants of Kitron , nor the inhabitants of Nahalol ; but the Canaanites dwelt among them , and became tributaries .
DARBY	Judges	1	31	Asher did not dispossess the inhabitants of Accho , nor the inhabitants of Zidon , nor Ahlab , nor Achzib , nor Helbah , nor Aphik , nor Rehob ;
DARBY	Judges	1	32	and the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land ; for they did not dispossess them .
DARBY	Judges	1	33	Naphtali did not dispossess the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh , nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath ; and he dwelt among the Canaanites , the inhabitants of the land , but the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries to them .
DARBY	Judges	1	34	And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill-country , for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley .
DARBY	Judges	1	35	And the Amorites would dwell on mount Heres , in Ajalon and in Shaalbim ; but the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed , and they became tributaries .
DARBY	Judges	1	36	And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim , from the rock , and upwards .
DARBY	Judges	2	2	ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land ; ye shall throw down their altars : but ye have not hearkened unto my voice . Why have ye done this ?
DARBY	Judges	2	3	Wherefore I also said , I will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be [ scourges ] in your sides , and their gods shall be a snare unto you .
DARBY	Judges	2	4	And it came to pass , when the Angel of Jehovah spoke these words to all the children of Israel , that the people lifted up their voice and wept .
DARBY	Judges	2	5	And they called the name of that place Bochim ; and they sacrificed there to Jehovah .
DARBY	Judges	2	6	And Joshua dismissed the people , and the children of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land .
DARBY	Judges	2	7	And the people served Jehovah all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders whose days were prolonged after Joshua , who had seen all the great works of Jehovah , which he had done for Israel .
DARBY	Judges	2	8	And Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of Jehovah , died , a hundred and ten years old .
DARBY	Judges	2	9	And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-Heres , in mount Ephraim , on the north side of the mountain of Gaash .
DARBY	Judges	2	10	And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers ; and there arose another generation after them , which knew not Jehovah , nor yet the works which he had done for Israel .
DARBY	Judges	2	11	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of Jehovah , and served the Baals .
DARBY	Judges	2	12	And they forsook Jehovah the God of their fathers , who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods of the gods of the peoples that were round about them , and bowed themselves to them , and provoked Jehovah to anger .
DARBY	Judges	2	13	And they forsook Jehovah , and served Baal and the Ashtoreths .
DARBY	Judges	2	14	And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them , and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about ; and they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
DARBY	Judges	2	15	Whithersoever they went out the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil , as Jehovah had said , and as Jehovah had sworn unto them ; and they were greatly distressed .
DARBY	Judges	2	16	And Jehovah raised up judges , and they saved them out of the hand of those that spoiled them .
DARBY	Judges	2	17	But they did not even hearken to their judges , for they went a whoring after other gods , and bowed themselves to them ; they turned quickly out of the way that their fathers had walked in , obeying the commandments of Jehovah ; they did not so .
DARBY	Judges	2	18	And when Jehovah raised them up judges , then Jehovah was with the judge , and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge ; for it repented Jehovah because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and crushed them .
DARBY	Judges	2	19	And it came to pass when the judge died , that they turned back and corrupted themselves more than their fathers , in following other gods to serve them , and to bow down to them : they ceased not from their own doings , nor from their stubborn way .
DARBY	Judges	2	20	And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel ; and he said , Because this nation hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers , and hath not hearkened unto my voice ,
DARBY	Judges	2	21	I also will not henceforth dispossess from before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died ;
DARBY	Judges	2	22	that through them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of Jehovah to walk therein , as their fathers did keep [ it ] , or not .
DARBY	Judges	2	23	Therefore Jehovah left those nations , without dispossessing them hastily , neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua .
DARBY	Judges	3	3	five lord ships of the Philistines , and all the Canaanites , and the Sidonians , and the Hivites that dwell on mount Lebanon ; from mount Baal-Hermon unto the entering into Hamath .
DARBY	Judges	3	2	only that the generations of the children of Israel might know war by learning it , at the least those who before had known nothing thereof :
DARBY	Judges	3	4	And they were to prove Israel by them , to know whether they would obey the commandments of Jehovah , which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses .
DARBY	Judges	3	5	And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites : Hittites and Amorites and Perizzites and Hivites and Jebusites ;
DARBY	Judges	3	6	and they took their daughters as wives , and gave their daughters to their sons , and served their gods .
DARBY	Judges	3	7	And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of Jehovah , and forgot Jehovah their God , and served the Baals and the Asherahs .
DARBY	Judges	3	8	And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia ; and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years .
DARBY	Judges	3	9	And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah ; and Jehovah raised up a saviour to the children of Israel , who saved them , Othniel the son of Kenaz , Caleb 's younger brother .
DARBY	Judges	3	10	And the Spirit of Jehovah was upon him , and he judged Israel ; and he went out to war , and Jehovah gave Chushan-rishathaim king of Syria into his hand ; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim .
DARBY	Judges	3	11	And the land had rest forty years ; and Othniel the son of Kenaz died .
DARBY	Judges	3	12	And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of Jehovah ; and Jehovah strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they did evil in the sight of Jehovah .
DARBY	Judges	3	13	And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek and went and smote Israel , and they took possession of the city of palm-trees .
DARBY	Judges	3	14	And the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years .
DARBY	Judges	3	15	And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah , and Jehovah raised them up a saviour , Ehud the son of Gera , the Benjaminite , a man left-handed . And by him the children of Israel sent a gift to Eglon king of Moab .
DARBY	Judges	3	16	And Ehud made him a sword having two edges , it was of a cubit length ; and he girded it under his raiment upon his right hip .
DARBY	Judges	3	17	And he brought the gift to Eglon king of Moab ; now Eglon was a very fat man .
DARBY	Judges	3	18	And it came to pass when he had ended offering the gift , he sent away the people that had borne the gift .
DARBY	Judges	3	19	But he turned from the graven images that were by Gilgal , and said , I have a secret word unto thee , O king . And he said , Be silent ! And all that stood by him went out from him .
DARBY	Judges	3	20	And Ehud came to him ; now he was sitting in the cool upper-chamber , which was for him alone . And Ehud said , I have a word from God unto thee . And he arose from the seat .
DARBY	Judges	3	21	Then Ehud put forth his left hand , and took the sword from his right hip , and thrust it into his belly ;
DARBY	Judges	3	22	and the haft also went in after the blade , and the fat closed upon the blade ; for he did not draw the sword out of his belly , and it came out between the legs .
DARBY	Judges	3	23	And Ehud went out into the portico , and shut the doors of the upper-chamber upon him , and bolted them .
DARBY	Judges	3	24	And when he was gone out , the servants of the [ king ] came and saw , and behold , the doors of the upper-chamber were bolted . And they said , Surely he is covering his feet in the summer chamber .
DARBY	Judges	3	25	And they waited till they were ashamed ; and behold , he opened not the doors of the upper-chamber , and they took the key , and opened [ them ] , and behold , their lord lay dead on the earth .
DARBY	Judges	3	26	And Ehud had escaped while they lingered , and passed beyond the graven images , and escaped to Seirah .
DARBY	Judges	3	27	And it came to pass when he was come , that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim , and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill-country , and he before them .
DARBY	Judges	3	28	And he said to them , Follow after me , for Jehovah has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand . And they went down after him , and took the fords of the Jordan toward Moab , and suffered no one to pass over .
DARBY	Judges	3	29	And they slew the Moabites at that time , about ten thousand men , all fat , and all men of valour , and not a man escaped .
DARBY	Judges	3	30	And Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel . And the land had rest eighty years .
DARBY	Judges	3	31	And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath ; and he smote the Philistines , six hundred men , with an ox-goad . And he also delivered Israel .
DARBY	Judges	4	4	And Deborah , a prophetess , the wife of Lapidoth , judged Israel at that time .
DARBY	Judges	4	2	And Jehovah sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan , who reigned in Hazor ; and the captain of his army was Sisera , who dwelt in Harosheth-Goim .
DARBY	Judges	4	3	And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah ; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron , and he mightily oppressed the children of Israel twenty years .
DARBY	Judges	4	5	And she dwelt under the palm-tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim ; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
DARBY	Judges	4	6	And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-Naphtali , and said to him , Hath not Jehovah the God of Israel commanded ? Go and draw towards mount Tabor , and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun ,
DARBY	Judges	4	7	and I will draw unto thee , to the torrent Kishon , Sisera , the captain of Jabin 's army , and his chariots and his multitude , and I will give him into thy hand .
DARBY	Judges	4	8	And Barak said to her , If thou goest with me , then I will go , but if thou goest not with me , I will not go .
DARBY	Judges	4	9	And she said , I will by all means go with thee , only that it will not be to thine honour upon the way which thou goest , for Jehovah will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman . And Deborah arose , and went with Barak to Kedesh .
DARBY	Judges	4	10	And Barak called together Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh ; and there went up at his feet ten thousand men ; and Deborah went up with him .
DARBY	Judges	4	11	( Now Heber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites , from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses , and had pitched his tent as far as the oak of Zaannaim , which is by Kedesh . )
DARBY	Judges	4	12	And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to mount Tabor .
DARBY	Judges	4	13	Then Sisera gathered together all his chariots , nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from Harosheth-Goim to the torrent Kishon .
DARBY	Judges	4	14	And Deborah said to Barak , Up ; for this is the day in which Jehovah hath given Sisera into thy hand ! Is not Jehovah gone out before thee ? And Barak went down from mount Tabor , and ten thousand men after him .
DARBY	Judges	4	15	And Jehovah discomfited Sisera , and all the chariots , and all the army , with the edge of the sword before Barak ; and Sisera got down from [ his ] chariot , and fled on foot .
DARBY	Judges	4	16	And Barak pursued after the chariots , and after the army , to Harosheth-Goim ; and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword ; not one was left .
DARBY	Judges	4	17	And Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite ; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite .
DARBY	Judges	4	18	And Jael went out to meet Sisera , and said to him , Turn in , my lord , turn in to me ; fear not . And he turned in to her , into the tent , and she covered him with the quilt .
DARBY	Judges	4	19	And he said to her , Give me , I pray thee , a little water to drink , for I am thirsty . And she opened the flask of milk , and gave him drink , and covered him .
DARBY	Judges	4	20	And he said to her , Stand in the door of the tent , and it shall be if any one come and inquire of thee , and say , Is there any man here ? that thou shalt say , No .
DARBY	Judges	4	21	And Jael Heber 's wife took a tent-pin , and took the hammer in her hand , and went softly to him , and smote the pin into his temples , and it penetrated into the ground ; for he had fallen into a deep sleep and was faint ; and he died .
DARBY	Judges	4	22	And behold , as Barak pursued Sisera , Jael went out to meet him , and said to him , Come , and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest . And he went into her [ tent ] , and behold , Sisera lay dead , and the pin was in his temples .
DARBY	Judges	4	23	So God subdued on that day Jabin king of Canaan before the children of Israel .
DARBY	Judges	4	24	And the hand of the children of Israel ever advanced , and prevailed against Jabin king of Canaan , until they had cut off Jabin king of Canaan .
DARBY	Judges	5	5	The mountains quaked before the face of Jehovah , That Sinai , from before Jehovah the God of Israel .
DARBY	Judges	5	2	For that leaders led in Israel , For that the people willingly offered themselves , Bless Jehovah !
DARBY	Judges	5	3	Hear , ye kings ; give ear , ye princes , I , [ even ] I , will sing to Jehovah ; I will hymn to Jehovah the God of Israel .
DARBY	Judges	5	4	Jehovah , when thou wentest forth from Seir , When thou marchedst out of the fields of Edom , The earth trembled , and the heavens dropped , Yea , the clouds dropped water .
DARBY	Judges	5	6	In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath , in the days of Jael , The roads were unused , and the travellers on highways went by crooked paths .
DARBY	Judges	5	7	The villages ceased in Israel , Ceased until that I Deborah arose , That I arose a mother in Israel .
DARBY	Judges	5	8	They chose new gods ; then was war in the gates : Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel ?
DARBY	Judges	5	9	My heart is toward the governors of Israel , who offered themselves willingly among the people . Bless Jehovah !
DARBY	Judges	5	10	Ye that ride on white she-asses , ye that sit on carpets , and ye that walk by the way , consider .
DARBY	Judges	5	11	Because of the voice of those who divide [ the spoil ] in the midst of the places of drawing water ; There they rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah , His righteous acts toward his villages in Israel . Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates .
DARBY	Judges	5	12	Awake , awake , Deborah ! awake , awake , utter a song ! Arise , Barak , and lead captive thy captives , thou son of Abinoam !
DARBY	Judges	5	13	Then come down , thou , the remnant of nobles , [ as his ] people ; Jehovah ! come down with me in the midst of the mighty ones .
DARBY	Judges	5	14	Out of Ephraim [ came ] those whose root was in Amalek ; After thee was Benjamin among thy peoples . Out of Machir came down governors , And out of Zebulun they that handled the staff of the ruler .
DARBY	Judges	5	15	And the princes in Issachar were with Deborah ; And Issachar , like Barak ; They were sent into the valley at his feet . In the divisions of Reuben there were great resolves of heart !
DARBY	Judges	5	16	Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds , To hear the bleating of the flocks ? In the divisions of Reuben there were great deliberations of heart !
DARBY	Judges	5	17	Gilead abode beyond Jordan ; And Dan , why did he remain in ships ? Asher sat on the sea-shore , And abode in his creeks .
DARBY	Judges	5	18	Zebulun is a people [ that ] jeoparded their lives unto death , Naphtali also , on the high places of the field .
DARBY	Judges	5	19	Kings came , —they fought ; Then fought the kings of Canaan ; At Taanach , by the waters of Megiddo ; They took no spoil of silver .
DARBY	Judges	5	20	From heaven was the fight ; The stars from their courses fought with Sisera .
DARBY	Judges	5	21	The torrent of Kishon swept them away , That ancient torrent , the torrent Kishon . My soul , thou hast trodden down strength !
DARBY	Judges	5	22	Then did the horse-hoofs clatter with the coursings , The coursings of their steeds .
DARBY	Judges	5	23	Curse Meroz , saith the Angel of Jehovah ; Curse , curse the inhabitants thereof ; For they came not to the help of Jehovah , To the help of Jehovah among the mighty .
DARBY	Judges	5	24	Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be , Blessed above women in the tent !
DARBY	Judges	5	25	He asked water , she gave milk ; In the nobles ' bowl she brought forth cream .
DARBY	Judges	5	26	She put her hand to the tent-pin , And her right hand to the workmen 's hammer ; And she smote Sisera , she struck through his head , Shattered and pierced through his temples .
DARBY	Judges	5	27	Between her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay down : Between her feet he bowed , he fell ; Where he bowed , there he fell , overcome .
DARBY	Judges	5	28	Them other of Sisera looketh out at the window , And crieth through the lattice , Why is his chariot so long in coming ? Why tarry the trampings of his chariots ?
DARBY	Judges	5	29	The wise amongst her ladies answer [ her ] , Yea , she returneth answer to herself ,
DARBY	Judges	5	30	Have they not found , divided the booty , A damsel , two damsels , to each ? A booty of dyed stuffs for Sisera , A booty of dyed stuffs of embroidery , Dyed stuff of double embroidery for the neck of a spoiler ?
DARBY	Judges	5	31	So let all thine enemies perish , Jehovah ! But let them that love him be as the rising of the sun in its might . And the land had rest forty years .
DARBY	Judges	6	6	And Israel was greatly impoverished because of Midian . And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah .
DARBY	Judges	6	2	And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel . Because of the Midianites the children of Israel made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains , and the caves , and the strongholds .
DARBY	Judges	6	3	And it came to pass when Israel sowed , that Midian came up , and Amalek , and the children of the east , and came up against them .
DARBY	Judges	6	4	And they encamped against them , and destroyed the produce of the land , until thou come to Gazah , and they left no sustenance in Israel , neither sheep , nor ox , nor ass .
DARBY	Judges	6	5	For they came up with their cattle and their tents , and they came as locusts for multitude ; both they and their camels were without number ; and they entered into the land to destroy it .
DARBY	Judges	6	7	And it came to pass when the children of Israel cried to Jehovah because of Midian ,
DARBY	Judges	6	8	that Jehovah sent a prophet to the children of Israel , who said to them , Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel : I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bondage ;
DARBY	Judges	6	9	and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of all that oppressed you , and drove them out from before you , and gave you their land ,
DARBY	Judges	6	10	and I said to you , I am Jehovah your God ; fear not the gods of the Amorites , in whose land ye dwell . But ye have not hearkened to my voice .
DARBY	Judges	6	11	And an angel of Jehovah came and sat under the terebinth that was in Ophrah , that [ belonged ] to Joash the Abi-ezrite . And his son Gideon threshed wheat in the winepress , to secure [ it ] from the Midianites .
DARBY	Judges	6	12	And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him , and said to him , Jehovah is with thee , thou mighty man of valour .
DARBY	Judges	6	13	And Gideon said to him , Ah my Lord , if Jehovah be with us , why then is all this befallen us ? and where are all his miracles that our fathers told us of , saying , Did not Jehovah bring us up from Egypt ? And now Jehovah hath cast us off , and given us into the hand of Midian .
DARBY	Judges	6	14	And Jehovah looked upon him , and said , Go in this thy might , and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of Midian . Have not I sent thee ?
DARBY	Judges	6	15	And he said to him , Ah Lord , wherewith shall I save Israel ? behold , my thousand is the poorest in Manasseh , and I am the least in my father 's house .
DARBY	Judges	6	16	And Jehovah said to him , I will certainly be with thee ; and thou shalt smite Midian as one man .
DARBY	Judges	6	17	And he said to him , If now I have found favour in thine eyes , shew me a sign that it is thou who talkest with me .
DARBY	Judges	6	18	Depart not hence , I pray thee , until I come unto thee , and bring forth my present , and set it before thee . And he said , I will tarry until thou come again .
DARBY	Judges	6	19	And Gideon went in , and made ready a kid of the goats , and an ephah of flour in unleavened cakes : the flesh he put in a basket , and he put the broth in a pot , and brought it out to him under the terebinth , and presented it .
DARBY	Judges	6	20	And the Angel of God said to him , Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes , and lay them upon this rock , and pour out the broth . And he did so .
DARBY	Judges	6	21	And the Angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand , and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes ; and there rose up fire out of the rock , and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes . And the Angel of Jehovah departed out of his sight .
DARBY	Judges	6	22	And Gideon perceived that he was an angel of Jehovah ; and Gideon said , Alas , Lord Jehovah ! for because I have seen an angel of Jehovah face to face …
DARBY	Judges	6	23	And Jehovah said to him , Peace be unto thee : fear not ; thou shalt not die .
DARBY	Judges	6	24	And Gideon built there an altar to Jehovah , and called it Jehovah-shalom . To this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites .
DARBY	Judges	6	25	And it came to pass the same night , that Jehovah said to him , Take the young bullock , which thy father hath , even the second bullock of seven years old , and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath , and cut down the Asherah that is by it ;
DARBY	Judges	6	26	and build an altar to Jehovah thy God upon the top of this strong place in the ordered manner , and take the second bullock , and offer up a burnt-offering with the wood of the Asherah that thou shalt cut down .
DARBY	Judges	6	27	And Gideon took ten men of his servants , and did as Jehovah had said to him . And it came to pass , because he feared his father 's house , and the men of the city , if he did it by day , that he did it by night .
DARBY	Judges	6	28	And when the men of the city arose early in the morning , behold , the altar of Baal was broken down , and the Asherah was cut down that was by it , and the second bullock was offered up upon the altar that was built .
DARBY	Judges	6	29	And they said one to another , Who has done this thing ? And when they inquired and asked , they said , Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing .
DARBY	Judges	6	30	And the men of the city said to Joash , Bring out thy son , that he may die , because he has broken down the altar of Baal , and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it .
DARBY	Judges	6	31	And Joash said to all that stood near him , Will * ye * contend for Baal ? or will * ye * save him ? he that contends for him , let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning . If he be a god , let him plead for himself , because they have broken down his altar .
DARBY	Judges	6	32	And on that day they called him Jerubbaal , saying , Let Baal plead with him , because he has broken down his altar .
DARBY	Judges	6	33	And all Midian and Amalek and the children of the east were gathered together , and went over , and encamped in the valley of Jezreel .
DARBY	Judges	6	34	And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Gideon , and he blew the trumpet , and the Abi-ezrites were gathered after him .
DARBY	Judges	6	35	And he sent messengers throughout Manasseh , and they also were gathered after him ; and he sent messengers to Asher , and to Zebulun , and to Naphtali ; and they came up to meet them .
DARBY	Judges	6	36	And Gideon said to God , If thou wilt save Israel by my hand , as thou hast said ,
DARBY	Judges	6	37	behold , I put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor ; if dew shall be on the fleece only , and it be dry upon all the ground , then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand , as thou hast said .
DARBY	Judges	6	38	And it was so . And when he rose up early on the morrow , he pressed the fleece together , and wrung dew out of the fleece , a bowl-full of water .
DARBY	Judges	6	39	And Gideon said to God , Let not thine anger be hot against me , and I will speak but this once ! Let me prove , I pray thee , but this once with the fleece ; let it , I pray thee , be dry upon the fleece only , and upon all the ground let there be dew .
DARBY	Judges	6	40	And God did so that night , and it was dry upon the fleece only , but on all the ground there was dew .
DARBY	Judges	7	7	And Jehovah said to Gideon , By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you , and give Midian into thy hand ; and let all the people go every man to his place .
DARBY	Judges	7	2	And Jehovah said to Gideon , The people that are with thee are too many for me to give Midian into their hand , lest Israel vaunt themselves against me , saying , Mine own hand hath saved me .
DARBY	Judges	7	3	And now proclaim in the ears of the people , saying , Whoever is timid and afraid , let him go back and turn from mount Gilead . And there went back of the people twenty-two thousand ; and there remained ten thousand .
DARBY	Judges	7	4	And Jehovah said to Gideon , Still the people are many ; bring them down to the water , and I will try them for thee there , and it shall be , that of whom I shall say unto thee , This shall go with thee , the same shall go with thee ; and of whomsoever I shall say unto thee , This shall not go with thee , the same shall not go .
DARBY	Judges	7	5	And he brought down the people to the water ; and Jehovah said to Gideon , Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue , as a dog lappeth , him shalt thou set by himself ; likewise every one that boweth down on his knees to drink .
DARBY	Judges	7	6	And the number of them that lapped , with their hand to their mouth , were three hundred men ; and all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water .
DARBY	Judges	7	8	And they took the victuals of the people in their hand , and their trumpets ; and all the men of Israel he sent away , every man to his tent , but retained the three hundred men . Now the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley .
DARBY	Judges	7	9	And it came to pass in that night , that Jehovah said to him , Arise , go down to the camp ; for I have given it into thy hand .
DARBY	Judges	7	10	And if thou fear to go down , go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the camp ;
DARBY	Judges	7	11	and thou shalt hear what they say ; and afterwards shall thy hand be strengthened , and thou shalt go down unto the camp . And he went down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that were in the camp .
DARBY	Judges	7	12	And Midian and Amalek and all the children of the east lay along in the valley as locusts for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand upon the sea-shore for multitude .
DARBY	Judges	7	13	And Gideon came , and behold , a man was telling a dream to his fellow ; and he said , Behold , I dreamed a dream , and lo , a cake of barley-bread tumbled into the camp of Midian , and came to the tent , and smote it that it fell , and overturned it ; and the tent lay along .
DARBY	Judges	7	14	And his fellow answered and said , This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash , the man of Israel : God hath given into his hand Midian and all the host .
DARBY	Judges	7	15	And it came to pass when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation , that he worshipped . And he returned into the camp of Israel , and said , Arise ; for Jehovah hath given into your hand the camp of Midian .
DARBY	Judges	7	16	And he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put a trumpet in every man 's hand , and empty pitchers , and torches within the pitchers .
DARBY	Judges	7	17	And he said to them , Look on me , and do likewise ; behold , when I come to the extremity of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so shall ye do .
DARBY	Judges	7	18	And when I blow with a trumpet , I and all that are with me , ye also shall blow the trumpets around the whole camp , and shall say , For Jehovah and for Gideon !
DARBY	Judges	7	19	And Gideon , and the hundred men that were with him , came to the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch ; and they had but newly set the watch ; and they blew the trumpets , and broke the pitchers that were in their hands .
DARBY	Judges	7	20	And the three companies blew the trumpets , and broke in pieces the pitchers , and held the torches in their left hand , and the trumpets in their right hand for blowing , and cried , The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon !
DARBY	Judges	7	21	And they stood every man in his place round about the camp ; and all the host ran , and cried out , and fled .
DARBY	Judges	7	22	And the three hundred blew the trumpets , and Jehovah set every man 's sword against his fellow , even throughout the camp . And the host fled to Beth-shittah towards Zererah , to the border of Abel-meholah , by Tabbath .
DARBY	Judges	7	23	And the men of Israel were called together out of Naphtali , and out of Asher , and out of all Manasseh , and pursued after Midian .
DARBY	Judges	7	24	And Gideon sent messengers throughout mount Ephraim , saying , Come down against Midian , and take before them the waters unto Beth-barah , and the Jordan . And all the men of Ephraim were called together , and took the waters unto Beth-barah , and the Jordan .
DARBY	Judges	7	25	And they took two princes of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb ; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb , and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb ; and they pursued Midian , and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan .
DARBY	Judges	8	8	And he went up thence to Penuel , and spoke to them in like manner . And the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered .
DARBY	Judges	8	2	And he said to them , What have I done now in comparison with you ? Are not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer ?
DARBY	Judges	8	3	Into your hands hath God delivered the princes of Midian , Oreb and Zeeb ; and what was I able to do in comparison with you ? Then their spirit was appeased toward him , when he said that word .
DARBY	Judges	8	4	And Gideon came to the Jordan , [ and ] passed over , he and the three hundred men that were with him , faint , yet pursuing .
DARBY	Judges	8	5	And he said to the men of Succoth , Give , I pray you , loaves of bread to the people that follow me , for they are faint ; and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna , kings of Midian .
DARBY	Judges	8	6	And the chief men of Succoth said , Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in thy hand , that we should give bread to thine army ?
DARBY	Judges	8	7	And Gideon said , Therefore when Jehovah delivers Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand , I will thresh your flesh with thorns of the wilderness and with briars .
DARBY	Judges	8	9	And he spoke also to the men of Penuel , saying , When I come again in peace , I will break down this tower .
DARBY	Judges	8	10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor , and their camp with them , about fifteen thousand [ men ] , all that were left of the whole camp of the children of the east ; for there had fallen a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword .
DARBY	Judges	8	11	And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwell in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah , and smote the camp ; for the camp was at its ease .
DARBY	Judges	8	12	And Zebah and Zalmunna fled , and he pursued after them , and he took the two kings of Midian , Zebah and Zalmunna , and discomfited all the camp .
DARBY	Judges	8	13	And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle , from the ascent of Heres .
DARBY	Judges	8	14	And he caught a youth of the men of Succoth , and inquired of him ; and he wrote down for him the chief men of Succoth , and the elders thereof , seventy-seven men .
DARBY	Judges	8	15	And he came to the men of Succoth , and said , Behold Zebah and Zalmunna , with whom ye did upbraid me , saying , Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in thy hand , that we should give bread to thy men that are weary ?
DARBY	Judges	8	16	And he took the elders of the city , and thorns of the wilderness and briars , and with them he taught the men of Succoth .
DARBY	Judges	8	17	And he broke down the tower of Penuel , and slew the men of the city .
DARBY	Judges	8	18	Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna , What sort of men were they that ye slew at Tabor ? And they answered , As thou art , so were they ; each one resembled the sons of a king .
DARBY	Judges	8	19	And he said , They were my brethren , the sons of my mother . [ As ] Jehovah liveth , if ye had saved them alive , I would not slay you .
DARBY	Judges	8	20	And he said to Jether his firstborn , Arise , slay them ! But the youth drew not his sword ; for he feared , because he was yet a youth .
DARBY	Judges	8	21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said , Rise thou , and fall on us ; for as is the man , so is his strength . And Gideon arose , and slew Zebah and Zalmunna ; and he took the moons that were on their camels ' necks .
DARBY	Judges	8	22	And the men of Israel said to Gideon , Rule over us , both thou , and thy son , and thy son 's son also ; for thou hast saved us from the hand of Midian .
DARBY	Judges	8	23	And Gideon said to them , I will not rule over you , neither shall my son rule over you : Jehovah will rule over you .
DARBY	Judges	8	24	And Gideon said to them , I would desire a request of you : give me every man the earrings of his booty ; for they had golden earrings , because they were Ishmaelites .
DARBY	Judges	8	25	And they said , We will willingly give [ them ] . And they spread a garment , and cast therein every man the earrings of his booty .
DARBY	Judges	8	26	And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand seven hundred [ shekels ] of gold ; besides the moons , and eardrops , and the purple garments that were on the kings of Midian , and besides the chains that were about their camels ' necks .
DARBY	Judges	8	27	And Gideon made an ephod of them , and put it in his city , in Ophrah . And all Israel went thither a whoring after it ; and it became a snare to Gideon , and to his house .
DARBY	Judges	8	28	And Midian was subdued before the children of Israel , and they lifted up their heads no more . And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon .
DARBY	Judges	8	29	And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his house .
DARBY	Judges	8	30	Now Gideon had seventy sons who had come out of his loins , for he had many wives .
DARBY	Judges	8	31	And his concubine that was in Shechem , she also bore him a son , and he gave him the name of Abimelech .
DARBY	Judges	8	32	And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age , and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father , in Ophrah of the Abi-ezrites .
DARBY	Judges	8	33	And it came to pass when Gideon was dead , that the children of Israel turned again , and went a whoring after the Baals , and set up Baal-Berith as their god .
DARBY	Judges	8	34	And the children of Israel remembered not Jehovah their God , who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side .
DARBY	Judges	8	35	And they shewed no kindness to the house of Jerubbaal-Gideon , according to all the good that he had done to Israel .
DARBY	Judges	9	9	And the olive-tree said to them , Should I leave my fatness , wherewith by me they honour God and man , and go to wave over the trees ?
DARBY	Judges	9	2	Speak , I pray you , in the ears of all the citizens of Shechem , Which is better for you , that seventy persons , all sons of Jerubbaal , rule over you , or that one man rule over you ? And remember that I am your bone and your flesh .
DARBY	Judges	9	3	And his mother 's brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the citizens of Shechem all these words . And their heart inclined after Abimelech ; for they said , He is our brother .
DARBY	Judges	9	4	And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-Berith , and Abimelech hired with them vain and wanton men , and they followed him .
DARBY	Judges	9	5	And he came to his father 's house , to Ophrah , and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal , seventy persons upon one stone ; but there remained Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal ; for he had hid himself .
DARBY	Judges	9	6	And all the citizens of Shechem gathered together , and all the house of Millo , and went and made Abimelech king , by the memorial-oak that is in Shechem .
DARBY	Judges	9	7	And they told it to Jotham , and he went and stood on the top of mount Gerizim , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said to them , Hearken to me , ye citizens of Shechem , that God may hearken to you .
DARBY	Judges	9	8	The trees once went forth to anoint a king over them ; and they said to the olive-tree , Reign over us .
DARBY	Judges	9	10	And the trees said to the fig-tree , Come thou , reign over us .
DARBY	Judges	9	11	But the fig-tree said to them , Should I leave my sweetness , and my good fruit , and go to wave over the trees ?
DARBY	Judges	9	12	Then said the trees to the vine , Come thou , reign over us .
DARBY	Judges	9	13	And the vine said to them , Should I leave my new wine , which cheers God and man , and go to wave over the trees ?
DARBY	Judges	9	14	Then said all the trees to the thorn-bush , Come thou , reign over us .
DARBY	Judges	9	15	And the thorn-bush said to the trees , If in truth ye anoint me king over you , come , put confidence in my shadow ; but if not , fire shall come out of the thorn-bush and devour the cedars of Lebanon .
DARBY	Judges	9	16	Now therefore , if ye have dealt truly and sincerely in that ye have made Abimelech king , and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house , and if ye have done to him according to the deserving of his hands ;
DARBY	Judges	9	17	—for my father fought for you , and endangered his life , and delivered you out of the hand of Midian ;
DARBY	Judges	9	18	but ye are risen up against my father 's house this day , and have slain his sons , seventy men , upon one stone , and have made Abimelech , the son of his handmaid , king over the citizens of Shechem , because he is your brother ;
DARBY	Judges	9	19	—if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day , rejoice ye in Abimelech , and let him also rejoice in you ;
DARBY	Judges	9	20	but if not , let fire come out from Abimelech , and devour the citizens of Shechem and the house of Millo ; and let fire come out from the citizens of Shechem and from the house of Millo , and devour Abimelech .
DARBY	Judges	9	21	And Jotham ran away , and fled , and went to Beer , and dwelt there , because of Abimelech his brother .
DARBY	Judges	9	22	And Abimelech ruled over Israel three years .
DARBY	Judges	9	23	And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem ; and the citizens of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech ,
DARBY	Judges	9	24	that the violence [ done ] to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come , and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother , who slew them , and upon the citizens of Shechem , who had strengthened his hands to slay his brethren .
DARBY	Judges	9	25	And the citizens of Shechem set liers in wait for him on the tops of the mountains , and they robbed all that came along that way by them . And it was told Abimelech .
DARBY	Judges	9	26	And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren , and went over to Shechem ; and the citizens of Shechem put confidence in him .
DARBY	Judges	9	27	And they went out into the fields , and gathered their vineyards , and trode [ the grapes ] , and made rejoicings , and went into the house of their god , and ate and drank , and cursed Abimelech .
DARBY	Judges	9	28	And Gaal the son of Ebed said , Who is Abimelech , and who is Shechem , that we should serve him ? is he not the son of Jerubbaal ? and Zebul his overseer ? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem ! and why should * we * serve him ?
DARBY	Judges	9	29	Oh ! would that this people were under my hand ! then would I remove Abimelech . And he said to Abimelech , Increase thine army , and come out .
DARBY	Judges	9	30	And Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed , and his anger was kindled ;
DARBY	Judges	9	31	and he sent messengers to Abimelech craftily , saying , Behold , Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem , and behold , they shut up the city against thee ;
DARBY	Judges	9	32	and now , rise up by night , thou and the people that are with thee , and lie in ambush in the fields .
DARBY	Judges	9	33	And it shall be in the morning when the sun is up , thou shalt rise early , and fall upon the city ; and behold , he and the people that is with him shall come out against thee , and thou shalt do with him as thou shalt find occasion .
DARBY	Judges	9	34	And Abimelech rose up , and all the people that were with him , by night , and they lay in ambush against Shechem in four companies .
DARBY	Judges	9	35	And Gaal the son of Ebed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city . Then Abimelech rose up , and the people that were with him , out of the ambush .
DARBY	Judges	9	36	And Gaal saw the people , and said to Zebul , Behold , people are coming down from the tops of the mountains . And Zebul said to him , Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as men .
DARBY	Judges	9	37	And Gaal spoke again , and said , Behold , people are coming down from the high part of the land , and one company is coming along by the way of the Magician 's oak .
DARBY	Judges	9	38	Then said Zebul to him , Where is now thy mouth , thou that saidst , Who is Abimelech , that we should serve him ? is not this the people that thou hast despised ? go out now , I pray , and fight against them .
DARBY	Judges	9	39	And Gaal went out before the citizens of Shechem , and fought against Abimelech .
DARBY	Judges	9	40	And Abimelech pursued him , and he fled before him , and there fell many wounded , as far as the entrance of the gate .
DARBY	Judges	9	41	And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah . And Zebul drove out Gaal and his brethren , that they might not dwell in Shechem .
DARBY	Judges	9	42	And it came to pass on the morrow , that the people went out into the field ; and they told Abimelech .
DARBY	Judges	9	43	And he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and lay in ambush in the field . And he looked , and behold , the people came forth out of the city ; and he rose up against them and smote them .
DARBY	Judges	9	44	And Abimelech , and the companies that were with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city ; and two of the companies ran upon all that were in the fields , and slew them .
DARBY	Judges	9	45	And Abimelech fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and slew the people that were in it , and broke down the city , and sowed it with salt .
DARBY	Judges	9	46	And all the men of the tower of Shechem heard [ that ] , and they entered into the stronghold of the house of the god Berith .
DARBY	Judges	9	47	And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem had gathered together .
DARBY	Judges	9	48	Then Abimelech went up to mount Zalmon , he and all the people that were with him ; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand , and cut down a bough from the trees , and took it up and laid it on his shoulder , and said to the people that was with him , What ye have seen me do , make haste , do as I have done .
DARBY	Judges	9	49	And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough , and they followed Abimelech , and put [ them ] to the hold , and burned the hold with fire upon them . And all the men of the tower of Shechem died also , about a thousand men and women .
DARBY	Judges	9	50	And Abimelech went to Thebez , and encamped against Thebez , and took it .
DARBY	Judges	9	51	But there was a strong tower in the midst of the city , and thither fled all the men and women , all the citizens of the city ; and they shut it behind them , and went up to the roof of the tower .
DARBY	Judges	9	52	And Abimelech came to the tower , and fought against it , and he drew near to the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire ;
DARBY	Judges	9	53	and a woman cast the upper stone of a handmill on Abimelech 's head , and crushed his skull .
DARBY	Judges	9	54	Then he called hastily to the young man that carried his armour , and said to him , Draw thy sword , and slay me , that they say not of me , A woman killed him . And his young man thrust him through , and he died .
DARBY	Judges	9	55	And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead , they went every man to his place .
DARBY	Judges	9	56	And God rendered back the wickedness of Abimelech , which he did to his father in slaying his seventy brethren .
DARBY	Judges	9	57	And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render back upon their heads ; and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal .
DARBY	Judges	10	10	And the children of Israel cried to Jehovah , saying , We have sinned against thee , both because we have forsaken our God , and also served the Baals .
DARBY	Judges	10	2	And he judged Israel twenty-three years ; and he died , and was buried in Shamir .
DARBY	Judges	10	3	And after him rose up Jair , a Gileadite ; and he judged Israel twenty-two years .
DARBY	Judges	10	4	And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty ass colts ; and they had thirty cities , which are called the villages of Jair to this day , which are in the land of Gilead .
DARBY	Judges	10	5	And Jair died , and was buried in Kamon .
DARBY	Judges	10	6	And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of Jehovah , and served the Baals , and the Ashtoreths , and the gods of Syria , and the gods of Zidon , and the gods of Moab , and the gods of the children of Ammon , and the gods of the Philistines ; and they forsook Jehovah , and served him not .
DARBY	Judges	10	7	And the anger of Jehovah was hot against Israel , and he sold him into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the children of Ammon .
DARBY	Judges	10	8	And they oppressed and crushed the children of Israel in that year ; eighteen years [ they oppressed ] all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites , which is in Gilead .
DARBY	Judges	10	9	And the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah , and against Benjamin , and against the house of Ephraim ; and Israel was greatly distressed .
DARBY	Judges	10	11	And Jehovah said to the children of Israel , Did I not [ save you ] from the Egyptians , and from the Amorites , from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines ?
DARBY	Judges	10	12	The Zidonians also , and Amalek and Maon oppressed you , and ye cried to me , and I saved you out of their hand .
DARBY	Judges	10	13	But ye have forsaken me , and served other gods ; therefore I will save you no more .
DARBY	Judges	10	14	Go and cry to the gods that ye have chosen : let them save you in the time of your trouble .
DARBY	Judges	10	15	And the children of Israel said to Jehovah , We have sinned . Do thou unto us according to all that is good in thy sight ; only deliver us , we pray thee , this day .
DARBY	Judges	10	16	And they put away the strange gods from among them , and served Jehovah ; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel .
DARBY	Judges	10	17	And the children of Ammon were called together and encamped in Gilead ; and the children of Israel gathered together and encamped in Mizpeh .
DARBY	Judges	10	18	And the people , the chief men of Gilead , said one to another , Who is the man that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon ? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead .
DARBY	Judges	11	11	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead , and the people made him head and captain over them ; and Jephthah uttered all his words before Jehovah in Mizpah .
DARBY	Judges	11	2	And Gilead 's wife bore him sons ; and when his wife 's sons were grown , they expelled Jephthah , and said to him , Thou shalt not inherit in our father 's house ; for thou art the son of another woman .
DARBY	Judges	11	3	Then Jephthah fled from his brethren , and dwelt in the land of Tob . And vain men were gathered to Jephthah , and they made expeditions with him .
DARBY	Judges	11	4	And it came to pass after some time , that the children of Ammon fought with Israel .
DARBY	Judges	11	5	And when the children of Ammon made war against Israel , the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob .
DARBY	Judges	11	6	And they said to Jephthah , Come , and be our captain , that we may fight against the children of Ammon .
DARBY	Judges	11	7	And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead , Did not ye hate me , and expel me out of my father 's house ? and why are ye come to me now when ye are in trouble ?
DARBY	Judges	11	8	And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah , Therefore we have returned to thee now , that thou mayest go with us , and fight against the children of Ammon , and be head over all of us the inhabitants of Gilead .
DARBY	Judges	11	9	And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead , If ye take me back to fight against the children of Ammon , and Jehovah give them up before me , shall I be your head ?
DARBY	Judges	11	10	And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah , Jehovah be witness between us , if we do not so according to thy words !
DARBY	Judges	11	12	And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon , saying , What hast thou to do with me , that thou art come against me to fight against my land ?
DARBY	Judges	11	13	And the king of the children of Ammon said to the messengers of Jephthah , Because Israel took away my land , when they came up out of Egypt , from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok and unto the Jordan ; and now restore it peaceably .
DARBY	Judges	11	14	And Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon ,
DARBY	Judges	11	15	and said to him , Thus saith Jephthah : Israel took not away the land of Moab , nor the land of the children of Ammon .
DARBY	Judges	11	16	But when they came up from Egypt , then Israel walked through the wilderness as far as the Red sea , and came to Kadesh .
DARBY	Judges	11	17	And Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom , saying , Let me , I pray thee , pass through thy land ; but the king of Edom would not hearken . And they also sent to the king of Moab ; and he would not . And Israel abode in Kadesh .
DARBY	Judges	11	18	And they walked through the wilderness , and went round the land of Edom and the land of Moab , and came by the east of the land of Moab , and encamped beyond the Arnon , but came not within the border of Moab , for the Arnon is the border of Moab .
DARBY	Judges	11	19	And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites , the king of Heshbon , and Israel said to him , Let us pass , we pray thee , through thy land unto my place .
DARBY	Judges	11	20	But Sihon trusted not Israel , to let him pass through his border , and Sihon gathered all his people , and they encamped in Jahzah ; and he fought with Israel .
DARBY	Judges	11	21	And Jehovah the God of Israel gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel , and they smote them ; and Israel took possession of the whole land of the Amorites , who dwelt in that country .
DARBY	Judges	11	22	And they possessed all the borders of the Amorites , from the Arnon unto the Jabbok , and from the wilderness unto the Jordan .
DARBY	Judges	11	23	And now Jehovah the God of Israel has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel , and shouldest thou take possession of it ?
DARBY	Judges	11	24	Dost not thou possess what Chemosh thy god puts thee in possession of ? and whatever Jehovah our God has dispossessed before us , that will we possess .
DARBY	Judges	11	25	And now art thou indeed better than Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab ? did he ever strive with Israel ? did he ever fight against them ?
DARBY	Judges	11	26	While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its dependent villages , and in Aroer and its dependent villages , and in all the cities that are along the banks of the Arnon , three hundred years—why did ye not recover [ them ] within that time ?
DARBY	Judges	11	27	So I have not sinned against thee , but it is thou who doest me wrong in making war against me . Jehovah , the Judge , be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon !
DARBY	Judges	11	28	But the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not to the words of Jephthah that he had sent him .
DARBY	Judges	11	29	Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jephthah , and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh , and passed to Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon .
DARBY	Judges	11	30	And Jephthah vowed a vow to Jehovah , and said , If thou wilt without fail give the children of Ammon into my hand ,
DARBY	Judges	11	31	then shall that which cometh forth from the door of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Ammon , be Jehovah 's , and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering .
DARBY	Judges	11	32	And Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them ; and Jehovah gave them into his hand .
DARBY	Judges	11	33	And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith , twenty cities , even unto Abel-Cheramim , with a very great slaughter ; and the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel .
DARBY	Judges	11	34	And Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house , and behold , his daughter came out to meet him with tambours and with dances ; and she was an only child : besides her he had neither son nor daughter .
DARBY	Judges	11	35	And it came to pass , when he saw her , that he rent his garments , and said , Alas , my daughter ! thou hast brought me very low , and thou art one of them that trouble me ; for I have opened my mouth to Jehovah , and I can not go back .
DARBY	Judges	11	36	And she said to him , My father , if thou hast opened thy mouth to Jehovah , do to me according to that which has proceeded out of thy mouth ; forasmuch as Jehovah has taken vengeance for thee upon thine enemies , upon the children of Ammon .
DARBY	Judges	11	37	And she said to her father , Let this thing be done for me : leave me alone two months , that I may go and descend to the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my companions .
DARBY	Judges	11	38	And he said , Go . And he sent her away for two months . And she went with her companions , and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains .
DARBY	Judges	11	39	And it came to pass at the end of two months , that she returned to her father , and he performed on her the vow that he had vowed ; and she had known no man . And it became a fixed custom in Israel ,
DARBY	Judges	11	40	that from year to year the daughters of Israel go to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year .
DARBY	Judges	12	12	And Elon the Zebulonite died , and was buried in Ajalon in the land of Zebulun .
DARBY	Judges	12	2	And Jephthah said to them , I was at great strife , I and my people , with the children of Ammon ; and I called you , but ye saved me not out of their hand .
DARBY	Judges	12	3	And when I saw that ye would not save me , I put my life in my hand , and passed over against the children of Ammon , and Jehovah gave them into my hand . Why then are ye come up to me this day , to fight against me ?
DARBY	Judges	12	4	And Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead , and fought with Ephraim ; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim , because they said , Ye , Gilead , ye are fugitives of Ephraim in the midst of Ephraim , [ and ] in the midst of Manasseh .
DARBY	Judges	12	5	And Gilead took the fords of the Jordan before Ephraim ; and it came to pass that when the fugitives of Ephraim said , Let me go over , the men of Gilead said to him , Art thou an Ephraimite ? and he said , No .
DARBY	Judges	12	6	Then they said to him , Say now Shibboleth ! and he said , Sibboleth , and did not manage to pronounce [ it ] rightly . Then they took him , and slaughtered him at the fords of the Jordan . And there fell at that time of Ephraim forty-two thousand .
DARBY	Judges	12	7	And Jephthah judged Israel six years . And Jephthah the Gileadite died , and was buried in [ one of ] the cities of Gilead .
DARBY	Judges	12	8	And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel .
DARBY	Judges	12	9	And he had thirty sons ; and thirty daughters he sent out of the house , and thirty daughters he took in from abroad for his sons . And he judged Israel seven years .
DARBY	Judges	12	10	And Ibzan died , and was buried at Bethlehem .
DARBY	Judges	12	11	And after him Elon , the Zebulonite , judged Israel ; and he judged Israel ten years .
DARBY	Judges	12	13	And after him Abdon the son of Hillel , the Pirathonite , judged Israel .
DARBY	Judges	12	14	And he had forty sons and thirty grandsons , who rode on seventy ass colts . And he judged Israel eight years .
DARBY	Judges	12	15	And Abdon the son of Hillel , the Pirathonite , died , and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim , in the hill-country of the Amalekites .
DARBY	Judges	13	13	And the Angel of Jehovah said to Manoah , Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware :
DARBY	Judges	13	2	And there was a certain man of Zoreah , of the family of the Danites , and his name was Manoah . And his wife was barren and did not bear .
DARBY	Judges	13	3	And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to the woman , and said to her , Behold now , thou art barren and bearest not ; but thou shalt conceive and bear a son .
DARBY	Judges	13	4	And now beware , I pray thee , and drink not wine nor strong drink , and eat nothing unclean .
DARBY	Judges	13	5	For lo , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son , and no razor shall come on his head ; for the boy shall be a Nazarite of God from the womb ; and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines .
DARBY	Judges	13	6	And the woman came and told her husband , saying , A man of God came to me , and his appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God , very terrible ; but I did not ask him whence he was , neither did he tell me his name .
DARBY	Judges	13	7	And he said to me , Behold , thou shalt conceive and bear a son ; and now drink not wine nor strong drink , and eat not anything unclean ; for the boy shall be a Nazarite of God from the womb to the day of his death .
DARBY	Judges	13	8	Then Manoah prayed to Jehovah , and said , Ah Lord ! let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us , I pray thee , and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born .
DARBY	Judges	13	9	And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah ; and the Angel of God came again to the woman whilst she sat in the field ; but Manoah her husband was not with her .
DARBY	Judges	13	10	Then the woman hasted and ran , and informed her husband , and said to him , Behold , the man has appeared to me , that came to me that day .
DARBY	Judges	13	11	And Manoah rose up and went after his wife , and came to the man , and said to him , Art thou the man that didst speak to the woman ? And he said , I am .
DARBY	Judges	13	12	And Manoah said , When thy words then come to pass , what shall be the child 's manner and his doing ?
DARBY	Judges	13	14	she shall not eat of anything that cometh of the vine , neither shall she drink wine or strong drink , nor eat anything unclean : all that I commanded her shall she observe .
DARBY	Judges	13	15	And Manoah said to the Angel of Jehovah , I pray thee , let us detain thee , and we will make ready a kid of the goats for thee .
DARBY	Judges	13	16	And the Angel of Jehovah said to Manoah , Though thou shouldest detain me , I will not eat of thy bread ; and if thou wilt offer a burnt-offering , thou shalt offer it up to Jehovah . For Manoah knew not that he was the Angel of Jehovah .
DARBY	Judges	13	17	And Manoah said to the Angel of Jehovah , What is thy name , that when thy word cometh to pass we may do thee honour ?
DARBY	Judges	13	18	And the Angel of Jehovah said to him , How is it that thou askest after my name , seeing it is wonderful ?
DARBY	Judges	13	19	Then Manoah took the kid and the oblation , and offered it up to Jehovah upon the rock . And he did wondrously , and Manoah and his wife looked on .
DARBY	Judges	13	20	And it came to pass , as the flame went up from off the altar towards the heavens , that the Angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar ; and Manoah and his wife looked on , and fell on their faces to the ground .
DARBY	Judges	13	21	And the Angel of Jehovah appeared no more to Manoah and to his wife . Then Manoah knew that it was the Angel of Jehovah .
DARBY	Judges	13	22	And Manoah said to his wife , We shall surely die , because we have seen God .
DARBY	Judges	13	23	But his wife said to him , If Jehovah were pleased to kill us , he would not have received a burnt-offering and an oblation at our hands , neither would he have shewed us all these things , nor would he at this time have told us [ such things ] as these .
DARBY	Judges	13	24	And the woman bore a son , and called his name Samson . And the child grew , and Jehovah blessed him .
DARBY	Judges	13	25	And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him at Mahaneh-Dan , between Zoreah and Eshtaol .
DARBY	Judges	14	14	And he said to them , Out of the eater came forth food , And out of the strong came forth sweetness . And they could not in three days explain the riddle .
DARBY	Judges	14	2	And he went up , and told his father and his mother , and said , I have seen a woman in Timnathah of the daughters of the Philistines ; and now take her for me as wife .
DARBY	Judges	14	3	And his father and his mother said to him , Is there no woman among the daughters of thy brethren , and among all my people , that thou goest to take a wife of the Philistines , the uncircumcised ? And Samson said to his father , Take her for me , for she pleases me well .
DARBY	Judges	14	4	And his father and his mother did not know that it was of Jehovah , that he was seeking an occasion against the Philistines . Now at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel .
DARBY	Judges	14	5	And Samson went down , and his father and his mother , to Timnathah ; and they came to the vineyards of Timnathah . And behold , a young lion roared against him ;
DARBY	Judges	14	6	and the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him , and he rent it as one rends a kid , and nothing was in his hand . And he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done .
DARBY	Judges	14	7	And he went down and talked with the woman ; and she pleased Samson well .
DARBY	Judges	14	8	And he returned after a time to take her , and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion ; and behold , [ there was ] a swarm of bees in the carcase of the lion , and honey ;
DARBY	Judges	14	9	and he took it out in his hands , and went on , and ate as he went . And he came to his father and to his mother , and gave them , and they ate ; but he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion .
DARBY	Judges	14	10	And his father went down to the woman , and Samson made there a feast ; for so used the young men to do .
DARBY	Judges	14	11	And it came to pass when they saw him , that they brought thirty companions , and they were with him .
DARBY	Judges	14	12	And Samson said to them , Let me now propound a riddle to you ; if ye clearly explain it to me within the seven days of the feast , and find [ it ] out , then I will give you thirty shirts , and thirty changes of garments .
DARBY	Judges	14	13	But if ye can not explain [ it ] to me , then shall ye give me thirty shirts , and thirty changes of garments . And they said to him , Propound thy riddle , that we may hear it .
DARBY	Judges	14	15	And it came to pass on the seventh day , that they said to Samson 's wife , Persuade thy husband , that he may explain to us the riddle , lest we burn thee and thy father 's house with fire . Have ye invited us to impoverish us , —is it not [ so ] ?
DARBY	Judges	14	16	And Samson 's wife wept before him , and said , Thou dost but hate me , and lovest me not . Thou hast propounded the riddle to the children of my people , and hast not explained it to me . And he said to her , Behold , I have not explained it to my father nor my mother , and shall I explain it to thee ?
DARBY	Judges	14	17	And she wept before him the seven days , while they had the feast . And it came to pass on the seventh day , that he explained it to her , for she pressed him . And she explained the riddle to the children of her people .
DARBY	Judges	14	18	And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down , What is sweeter than honey , And what stronger than a lion ? And he said to them , If ye had not ploughed with my heifer , Ye had not found out my riddle .
DARBY	Judges	14	19	And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him , and he went down to Ashkelon , and slew of them thirty men , and took their spoil , and gave the changes of garments unto them that explained the riddle . And his anger was kindled , and he went up to his father 's house .
DARBY	Judges	14	20	And Samson 's wife was [ given ] to his companion , whom he had made his friend .
DARBY	Judges	15	15	And he found a fresh jawbone of an ass , and put forth his hand and took it , and slew with it a thousand men .
DARBY	Judges	15	2	And her father said , I verily thought that thou didst utterly hate her ; therefore I gave her to thy companion . Is not her younger sister fairer than she ? Let her , I pray thee , be thine instead of her .
DARBY	Judges	15	3	And Samson said to them , This time I am blameless toward the Philistines , though I do them harm .
DARBY	Judges	15	4	And Samson went and caught three hundred jackals , and took torches , and turned tail to tail , and put a torch in the midst between the two tails .
DARBY	Judges	15	5	And he set the torches on fire , and let [ them ] run into the standing corn of the Philistines , and burnt up both the shocks , and also the standing corn , and the olive gardens .
DARBY	Judges	15	6	And the Philistines said , Who has done this ? And they answered , Samson , the son-in-law of the Timnite , because he took his wife and gave her to his companion . And the Philistines came up , and burned her and her father with fire .
DARBY	Judges	15	7	And Samson said to them , If ye act thus , for a certainty I will avenge myself on you , and then I will cease .
DARBY	Judges	15	8	And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter . And he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the cliff Etam .
DARBY	Judges	15	9	And the Philistines went up , and encamped in Judah , and spread themselves in Lehi .
DARBY	Judges	15	10	And the men of Judah said , Why are ye come up against us ? And they said , To bind Samson are we come up , to do to him as he has done to us .
DARBY	Judges	15	11	Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the cliff Etam , and said to Samson , Knowest thou not that the Philistines rule over us ? And what is this that thou hast done to us ? And he said to them , As they did to me , so have I done to them .
DARBY	Judges	15	12	And they said to him , We are come down to bind thee , that we may give thee into the hand of the Philistines . And Samson said to them , Swear to me that ye will not fall on me yourselves .
DARBY	Judges	15	13	And they spoke to him , saying , No ; but we will bind thee fast , and deliver thee into their hand ; but we certainly shall not put thee to death . And they bound him with two new cords , and brought him up from the cliff .
DARBY	Judges	15	14	When he came to Lehi , the Philistines shouted against him . And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him , and the cords that were on his arms became as threads of flax that are burned with fire , and his bands loosed from off his hands .
DARBY	Judges	15	16	And Samson said , With the jawbone of an ass , a heap , two heaps , With the jawbone of an ass have I slain a thousand men .
DARBY	Judges	15	17	And it came to pass when he had ended speaking , that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand , and called that place Ramath-Lehi .
DARBY	Judges	15	18	And he was very thirsty , and called on Jehovah , and said , Thou hast given by the hand of thy servant this great deliverance , and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised ?
DARBY	Judges	15	19	And God clave the hallow rock which was in Lehi , and water came out of it . And he drank , and his spirit came again , and he revived . Therefore its name was called En-hakkore , which is in Lehi to this day .
DARBY	Judges	15	20	And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years .
DARBY	Judges	16	16	And it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him , that his soul was vexed unto death ;
DARBY	Judges	16	2	[ And it was told ] the Gazathites , saying , Samson is come hither . And they surrounded [ him ] , and laid wait for him all night at the gate of the city , and were quiet all the night , saying , In the morning light we will kill him .
DARBY	Judges	16	3	And Samson lay till midnight ; and he arose at midnight , and seized the doors of the gate of the city , and the two posts , and tore them up with the bar , and put [ them ] upon his shoulders , and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron .
DARBY	Judges	16	4	And it came to pass afterwards that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek , whose name was Delilah .
DARBY	Judges	16	5	And the lords of the Philistines came up to her , and said to her , Persuade him , and see in what his great strength is , and with what we may prevail against him , that we may bind him to overpower him ; and we will each give thee eleven hundred silver-pieces .
DARBY	Judges	16	6	Then Delilah said to Samson , Tell me , I pray thee , in what is thy great strength , and with what thou mightest be bound to overpower thee .
DARBY	Judges	16	7	And Samson said to her , If they should bind me with seven fresh cords which have not been dried , then should I be weak , and be as another man .
DARBY	Judges	16	8	Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh cords which had not been dried , and she bound him with them .
DARBY	Judges	16	9	Now she had liers in wait abiding in the chamber ; and she said to him , The Philistines are upon thee , Samson ! And he broke the cords , as a thread of tow is broken when it touches the fire ; and his strength was not known .
DARBY	Judges	16	10	And Delilah said to Samson , Behold , thou hast mocked me and told me lies . Now tell me , I pray thee , with what thou mightest be bound .
DARBY	Judges	16	11	And he said to her , If they should bind me fast with new ropes , with which no work has been done , then should I be weak , and be as another man .
DARBY	Judges	16	12	And Delilah took new ropes , and bound him with them , and said to him , The Philistines are upon thee , Samson ! Now there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber . And he broke them from off his arms like a thread .
DARBY	Judges	16	13	And Delilah said to Samson , Hitherto thou hast mocked me and told me lies . Tell me with what thou mightest be bound . And he said to her , If thou shouldest weave the seven locks of my head with the web .
DARBY	Judges	16	14	And she fastened it with the pin , and said to him , The Philistines are upon thee , Samson ! And he awoke out of his sleep , and tore out the pin of the beam , and the web .
DARBY	Judges	16	15	Then she said to him , How canst thou say , I love thee , when thy heart is not with me ? these three times hast thou mocked me , and hast not told me in what is thy great strength .
DARBY	Judges	16	17	and he told her all his heart , and said to her , There has not come a razor upon my head ; for I am a Nazarite of God from my mother 's womb ; if I should be shaven , then my strength would go from me , and I should be weak , and be like all mankind .
DARBY	Judges	16	18	And Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart , and she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines , saying , Come up this time , for he has told me all his heart . And the lords of the Philistines came up to her , and brought the money in their hand .
DARBY	Judges	16	19	And she made him sleep upon her knees , and called a man , and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head ; and she began to overpower him , and his strength went from him .
DARBY	Judges	16	20	And she said , The Philistines are upon thee , Samson ! And he awoke out of his sleep , and thought , I will go out as at other times before , and disengage myself . And he knew not that Jehovah had departed from him .
DARBY	Judges	16	21	And the Philistines seized him , and put out his eyes , and brought him down to Gazah , and bound him with fetters of bronze ; and he had to grind in the prison-house .
DARBY	Judges	16	22	But the hair of his head began to grow after he was shaved .
DARBY	Judges	16	23	Then the lords of the Philistines gathered together to sacrifice a great sacrifice to Dagon their god , and to rejoice ; for they said , Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hands .
DARBY	Judges	16	24	And when the people saw him , they praised their god ; for they said , Our god has given into our hands our enemy , and the destroyer of our country , even him who multiplied our slain .
DARBY	Judges	16	25	And it came to pass when their hearts were merry , that they said , Call for Samson , that he may make us sport . And they called for Samson out of the prison-house , and he played before them ; and they set him between the pillars .
DARBY	Judges	16	26	And Samson said to the lad that held him by the hand , Let loose of me , and suffer me to feel the pillars upon which the house stands , that I may lean upon them .
DARBY	Judges	16	27	Now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lords of the Philistines were there ; and upon the roof there were about three thousand men and women , who looked on while Samson made sport .
DARBY	Judges	16	28	And Samson called to Jehovah , and said , Lord Jehovah , remember me , I pray thee , and strengthen me , I pray thee , only this once , O God , that I may take one vengeance upon the Philistines for my two eyes .
DARBY	Judges	16	29	And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood ( and he supported himself upon them ) , the one with his right hand and the other with his left .
DARBY	Judges	16	30	And Samson said , Let me die with the Philistines ! And he bowed himself with might ; and the house fell on the lords , and on all the people that were therein . So the dead that he slew at his death were more than those whom he had slain in his life .
DARBY	Judges	16	31	And his brethren came down , and all the house of his father , and took him , and brought him up , and buried him between Zoreah and Eshtaol in the sepulchre of Manoah his father . And he had judged Israel twenty years .
DARBY	Judges	17	17	And there was a man of mount Ephraim , whose name was Micah .
DARBY	Judges	17	2	And he said to his mother , The eleven hundred silver-pieces that were taken from thee , and about which thou didst curse and speak of in mine ears , behold , the silver is with me ; I took it . And his mother said , Blessed be my son of Jehovah !
DARBY	Judges	17	3	And he restored the eleven hundred silver-pieces to his mother ; and his mother said , I had dedicated the silver to Jehovah from my hand for my son , to make a graven image and a molten image ; and now I will restore it to thee .
DARBY	Judges	17	4	Now he restored the silver to his mother ; and his mother took two hundred silver-pieces and gave them to the founder , and he made of them a graven image and a molten image ; and they were in the house of Micah .
DARBY	Judges	17	5	And the man Micah had a house of gods , and made an ephod and teraphim , and consecrated one of his sons , who became his priest .
DARBY	Judges	17	6	In those days there was no king in Israel ; every man did what was right in his own eyes .
DARBY	Judges	17	7	And there was a young man out of Bethlehem-Judah of the family of Judah , who was a Levite , and he sojourned there .
DARBY	Judges	17	8	And the man departed from the city , from Bethlehem-Judah , to sojourn where he might find [ a place ] . And as he journeyed , he came to mount Ephraim , to the house of Micah .
DARBY	Judges	17	9	And Micah said to him , Whence comest thou ? And he said to him , I am a Levite of Bethlehem-Judah , and I go to sojourn where I may find [ a place ] .
DARBY	Judges	17	10	And Micah said to him , Dwell with me , and be to me a father and a priest , and I will give thee yearly ten silver-pieces , and a suit of garments , and thy victuals . And the Levite went in .
DARBY	Judges	17	11	And the Levite was content to dwell with the man ; and the young man was to him as one of his sons .
DARBY	Judges	17	12	And Micah consecrated the Levite ; and the young man became his priest , and was in the house of Micah .
DARBY	Judges	17	13	Then said Micah , Now I know that Jehovah will do me good , because I have the Levite for priest .
DARBY	Judges	18	18	And these came into Micah 's house , and took the carved image , the ephod , and the teraphim , and the molten image . And the priest said to them , What do ye ?
DARBY	Judges	18	2	And the children of Dan sent of their family five men of their whole number , men of valour , from Zoreah and from Eshtaol , to spy out the land , and to examine it ; and they said to them , Go , examine the land . And they came to the hill-country of Ephraim , to the house of Micah , and lodged there .
DARBY	Judges	18	3	When they were by the house of Micah , they knew the voice of the young man , the Levite ; and they turned in thither , and said to him , Who brought thee hither ? and what doest thou in this [ place ] ? and what hast thou here ?
DARBY	Judges	18	4	And he said to them , Thus and thus has Micah done to me ; and he has hired me , and I am his priest .
DARBY	Judges	18	5	And they said to him , Inquire , we pray thee , of God , that we may know whether our way on which we go shall be prosperous .
DARBY	Judges	18	6	And the priest said to them , Go in peace : before Jehovah is your way on which ye go .
DARBY	Judges	18	7	And the five men departed , and came to Laish ; and they saw the people that were therein , dwelling securely , after the manner of the Zidonians , quiet and secure ; and no one was in the land who possessed authority , that might put [ them ] to shame in anything ; and they were far from the Zidonians , and had nothing to do with [ any ] man .
DARBY	Judges	18	8	—And they came to their brethren at Zoreah and Eshtaol . And their brethren said to them , What [ say ] ye ?
DARBY	Judges	18	9	And they said , Arise , and let us go up against them ; for we have seen the land , and behold , it is very good ; and ye are still ! Be not slothful to go , to enter to take possession of the land .
DARBY	Judges	18	10	When ye go in , ye shall come to a people secure , and the land is spacious in every direction ; for God has given it into your hands ; [ it is ] a place where there is no want of anything that is on the earth .
DARBY	Judges	18	11	And there went from thence of the family of the Danites , out of Zoreah and out of Eshtaol , six hundred men girded with weapons of war .
DARBY	Judges	18	12	And they went up and encamped in Kirjath-jearim , in Judah ; therefore they call that place Mahaneh-Dan to this day : behold , it is behind Kirjath-jearim .
DARBY	Judges	18	13	And they passed thence to mount Ephraim , and came to the house of Micah .
DARBY	Judges	18	14	Then the five men that had gone to spy out the country of Laish spoke and said to their brethren , Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod , and teraphim , and a graven image , and a molten image ? And now ye know what to do .
DARBY	Judges	18	15	And they turned thither , and came to the house of the young man the Levite , the house of Micah , and inquired after his welfare .
DARBY	Judges	18	16	And the six hundred men of the children of Dan , girded with their weapons of war , stood at the entrance of the gate .
DARBY	Judges	18	17	And the five men that had gone to spy out the land went up , entered in thither , [ and ] took the graven image , and the ephod , and the teraphim , and the molten image ; and the priest stood at the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men that were girded with weapons of war .
DARBY	Judges	18	19	And they said to him , Hold thy peace , lay thy hand upon thy mouth , and go with us , and be to us a father and a priest . Is it better for thee to be a priest for the house of one man , or to be priest for a tribe and a family in Israel ?
DARBY	Judges	18	20	Then the priest 's heart was glad , and he took the ephod , and the teraphim , and the graven image , and went in the midst of the people .
DARBY	Judges	18	21	And they turned and departed , and put the little ones and the cattle and the baggage before them .
DARBY	Judges	18	22	They were already far from the house of Micah , when the men that were in the houses near to Micah 's house were gathered together , and overtook the children of Dan .
DARBY	Judges	18	23	And they cried to the children of Dan . And they turned their faces , and said to Micah , What aileth thee , that thou comest with such a company ?
DARBY	Judges	18	24	And he said , Ye have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and ye are gone away ; and what have I more ? and what is this that ye say to me , What aileth thee ?
DARBY	Judges	18	25	And the children of Dan said to him , Let not thy voice be heard among us , lest men of exasperated spirit run upon you , and thou lose thy life and the lives of thy household .
DARBY	Judges	18	26	And the children of Dan went their way ; and Micah saw that they were too strong for him , and he turned and went back to his house .
DARBY	Judges	18	27	And they took that which Micah had made , and the priest that he had had , and came upon Laish , upon a people quiet and secure ; and they smote them with the edge of the sword , and burned the city with fire .
DARBY	Judges	18	28	And there was no deliverer , for it was far from Zidon , and they had nothing to do with [ any ] man ; and it [ lay ] in the valley that is by Beth-rehob . And they built the city and dwelt therein .
DARBY	Judges	18	29	And they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born to Israel ; howbeit Laish was the name of the city at the first .
DARBY	Judges	18	30	And the children of Dan set up the graven image ; and Jehonathan , the son of Gershom , the son of Moses ; he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land .
DARBY	Judges	18	31	And they set up for themselves Micah 's graven image , which he had made , all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh .
DARBY	Judges	19	19	And we have both straw and provender for our asses ; and I have bread and wine also for me , and for thy handmaid , and for the young man with thy servants : there is no lack of anything .
DARBY	Judges	19	2	And his concubine played the whore against him , and went away from him to her father 's house to Bethlehem-Judah , and was there some time , —four months .
DARBY	Judges	19	3	And her husband rose up and went after her , to speak kindly to her , to bring her again ; and his servant was with him , and a couple of asses . And she brought him into her father 's house ; and when the father of the damsel saw him he rejoiced to meet him .
DARBY	Judges	19	4	And his father-in-law , the damsel 's father , retained him , and he abode with him three days ; and they ate and drank , and lodged there .
DARBY	Judges	19	5	And it came to pass on the fourth day , that they arose early in the morning , and he rose up to depart ; and the damsel 's father said to his son-in-law , Refresh thy heart with a morsel of bread , and afterwards ye may go your way .
DARBY	Judges	19	6	And they sat down , and ate and drank , both of them together . And the damsel 's father said to the man , Be content , I pray thee , and pass the night , and let thy heart be glad .
DARBY	Judges	19	7	And the man rose up to depart , but his father-in-law urged him , and he lodged there again .
DARBY	Judges	19	8	And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart ; but the damsel 's father said , Refresh thy heart , I pray thee . And they lingered until the afternoon , and they did eat both of them .
DARBY	Judges	19	9	And the man rose up to depart , he , and his concubine , and his servant ; and his father-in-law , the damsel 's father , said to him , Behold now , the day draws toward evening—I pray you stay all night ; behold , the day is declining , lodge here , and let thy heart be merry ; and to-morrow get you early on your way , that thou mayest go to thy tent .
DARBY	Judges	19	10	But the man would not tarry the night ; and he rose up and departed , and came opposite to Jebus , that is , Jerusalem ; and there were with him two asses saddled , and his concubine was with him .
DARBY	Judges	19	11	They were near Jebus , and the day was far spent ; and the servant said to his master , Come , I pray thee , and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites , and lodge in it .
DARBY	Judges	19	12	But his master said to him , We will not turn aside into the city of a stranger , which is not of the children of Israel , but we will pass on to Gibeah .
DARBY	Judges	19	13	And he said to his servant , Come and let us draw near to one of these places , and lodge in Gibeah , or in Ramah .
DARBY	Judges	19	14	And they passed on and went their way ; and the sun went down upon them [ when they were ] by Gibeah , which belongs to Benjamin .
DARBY	Judges	19	15	And they turned aside thither , to go in , to lodge in Gibeah . And he went in , and sat down in the open place of the city ; and there was no one that received him into his house to pass the night .
DARBY	Judges	19	16	And behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at even ; and the man was of mount Ephraim , and he sojourned in Gibeah ; but the men of the place were Benjaminites .
DARBY	Judges	19	17	And he lifted up his eyes , and saw the wayfaring man in the open place of the city ; and the old man said , Whither goest thou ? and whence comest thou ?
DARBY	Judges	19	18	And he said to him , We are travelling from Bethlehem-Judah towards the further side of mount Ephraim ; from thence am I ; and I went to Bethlehem-Judah , and I have to do with the house of Jehovah ; and there is no man that receives me into his house .
DARBY	Judges	19	20	Then the old man said , Peace be with thee ; only let all thy wants lie on me ; but lodge not in the street .
DARBY	Judges	19	21	And he brought him into his house , and gave the asses provender ; and they washed their feet , and ate and drank .
DARBY	Judges	19	22	They were making their hearts merry , when behold , the men of the city , sons of Belial , surrounded the house , beating at the door ; and they spoke to the master of the house , the old man , saying , Bring forth the man that came into thy house , that we may know him .
DARBY	Judges	19	23	And the man , the master of the house , went out to them , and said to them , No , my brethren , I pray you , do not wickedly ; seeing that this man is come into my house , do not this villany .
DARBY	Judges	19	24	Behold , my daughter , who is a virgin , and his concubine ; let me bring them out , and humble ye them , and do to them as is good in your sight ; but to this man do not so vile a thing .
DARBY	Judges	19	25	But the men would not hearken to him ; and the man took his concubine , and brought her forth to them ; and they knew her , and abused her all the night until the morning ; and let her go when the morning-dawn arose .
DARBY	Judges	19	26	And the woman came at the dawning of the day , and fell down at the entrance of the man 's house where her lord was , till it was light .
DARBY	Judges	19	27	And her lord rose up in the morning , and opened the door of the house , and went out to go his way , and behold , there lay the woman his concubine at the entrance of the house , and her hands were upon the threshold .
DARBY	Judges	19	28	And he said to her , Up , and let us go ; but no one answered . And he took her upon the ass ; and the man rose up , and went to his place .
DARBY	Judges	19	29	And when he was come into his house , he took the knife , and laid hold on his concubine , and divided her , according to her bones , into twelve pieces , and sent her into all the borders of Israel .
DARBY	Judges	19	30	And it came to pass that every one that saw it said , There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came out of Egypt to this day . Think it over , advise , and speak .
DARBY	Judges	20	20	And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah .
DARBY	Judges	20	2	And the heads of all the people , of all the tribes of Israel , presented themselves in the congregation of the people of God , four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword .
DARBY	Judges	20	3	And the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah . And the children of Israel said , Tell [ us ] , how was this wickedness ?
DARBY	Judges	20	4	Then the Levite , the husband of the woman that was murdered , answered and said , I came to Gibeah that [ belongs ] to Benjamin , I and my concubine , to lodge .
DARBY	Judges	20	5	And the citizens of Gibeah rose against me , and surrounded the house because of me , by night ; they thought to slay me , and my concubine have they humbled so that she died .
DARBY	Judges	20	6	Then I took my concubine , and cut her in pieces , and sent her throughout the country of the inheritance of Israel ; for they have committed lewdness and villany in Israel .
DARBY	Judges	20	7	Behold , all ye , children of Israel , deliberate and give here [ your ] counsel .
DARBY	Judges	20	8	And all the people rose up as one man , saying , We will not any one go to his tent , neither will we any one turn into his house .
DARBY	Judges	20	9	But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah : [ we go ] by lot against it ;
DARBY	Judges	20	10	and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel , and a hundred of a thousand , and a thousand of ten thousand , to fetch victuals for the people , that they may do , when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin , according to all the villany that they have wrought in Israel .
DARBY	Judges	20	11	And all the men of Israel were gathered against the city , knit together as one man .
DARBY	Judges	20	12	And the tribes of Israel sent men to all the families of Benjamin , saying , What wickedness is this that has been done among you ?
DARBY	Judges	20	13	And now give up the men , the sons of Belial , who are in Gibeah , that we may put them to death , and put away evil from Israel . But [ the children of ] Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel .
DARBY	Judges	20	14	And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities of Gibeah , to go out to battle against the children of Israel .
DARBY	Judges	20	15	And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities , twenty-six thousand men that drew sword , besides the inhabitants of Gibeah , who were numbered seven hundred chosen men .
DARBY	Judges	20	16	Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men left-handed ; all these slang stones at a hair [ breadth ] , and missed not .
DARBY	Judges	20	17	And the men of Israel , besides Benjamin , were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword : all these were men of war .
DARBY	Judges	20	18	And the children of Israel arose and went up to Bethel , and inquired of God , and said , Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin ? And Jehovah said , Judah first .
DARBY	Judges	20	19	And the children of Israel rose up in the morning and encamped against Gibeah .
DARBY	Judges	20	21	And the children of Benjamin went forth out of Gibeah , and destroyed to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty-two thousand men .
DARBY	Judges	20	22	And the people , the men of Israel , took courage , and set the battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
DARBY	Judges	20	23	And the children of Israel went up and wept before Jehovah until even , and inquired of Jehovah , saying , Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother ? And Jehovah said , Go up against him .
DARBY	Judges	20	24	And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day .
DARBY	Judges	20	25	And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day , and again destroyed to the ground of the children of Israel eighteen thousand men : all these drew the sword .
DARBY	Judges	20	26	Then all the children of Israel , and all the people , went up and came to Bethel , and wept , and abode there before Jehovah , and fasted that day until even , and offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah .
DARBY	Judges	20	27	And the children of Israel inquired of Jehovah ( and the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days ,
DARBY	Judges	20	28	and Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron , stood before it in those days ) , saying , Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother , or shall I cease ? And Jehovah said , Go up ; for to-morrow I will give them into thy hand .
DARBY	Judges	20	29	And Israel set liers in wait against Gibeah , round about .
DARBY	Judges	20	30	And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in array against Gibeah , as at the other times .
DARBY	Judges	20	31	And the children of Benjamin went out against the people , and were drawn away from the city , and began to smite of the people , slaying as at the former times , in the highways , of which one leads to Bethel and the other to Gibeah in the field , about thirty men of Israel .
DARBY	Judges	20	32	And the children of Benjamin said , They are smitten down before us , as at the first . And the children of Israel said , Let us flee , that we may draw them from the city to the highways .
DARBY	Judges	20	33	And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place , and put themselves in array at Baal-Tamar ; and the ambush of Israel rushed forth out of their place , out of the meadows of Geba .
DARBY	Judges	20	34	And there came from opposite Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel , and the battle was severe ; but they knew not that disaster was coming upon them .
DARBY	Judges	20	35	And Jehovah smote Benjamin before Israel ; and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjaminites that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men : all these drew the sword .
DARBY	Judges	20	36	And the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten.—And the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin , because they trusted to the ambush that they had set against Gibeah .
DARBY	Judges	20	37	And the ambush hasted , and fell upon Gibeah ; and the ambush drew along , and smote the whole city with the edge of the sword .
DARBY	Judges	20	38	Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambush , that they should make a thick column of smoke rise up out of the city .
DARBY	Judges	20	39	And when the men of Israel turned back in the battle , Benjamin began to smite , slaying of the men of Israel about thirty men ; for they said , Surely they are quite routed before us as in the first battle .
DARBY	Judges	20	40	And when the burning began to rise up out of the city as a pillar of smoke , Benjamin looked behind , and behold , the whole city ascended [ in smoke ] to the heavens .
DARBY	Judges	20	41	Then the men of Israel turned back , and the men of Benjamin were amazed , for they saw that disaster was come upon them .
DARBY	Judges	20	42	And they turned before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness ; but the battle overtook them ; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in their midst .
DARBY	Judges	20	43	They encompassed the Benjaminites , chased them , trode them down at the resting-place over against Gibeah toward the sun-rising .
DARBY	Judges	20	44	And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men : all these , men of valour .
DARBY	Judges	20	45	And they turned and fled towards the wilderness to the cliff of Rimmon , and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men ; and pursued hard after them to Gidom , and slew two thousand men of them .
DARBY	Judges	20	46	So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men that drew the sword : all these , men of valour .
DARBY	Judges	20	47	And six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness to the cliff of Rimmon , and abode at the cliff of Rimmon four months .
DARBY	Judges	20	48	And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin , and smote them with the edge of the sword , as well the men of [ every ] city as the cattle , and all that was found ; even all the cities that were found did they set on fire .
DARBY	Judges	21	21	and see , and behold , if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances , then come out of the vineyards , and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh , and go to the land of Benjamin .
DARBY	Judges	21	2	And the people came to Bethel , and abode there till even before God , and lifted up their voices and wept bitterly ,
DARBY	Judges	21	3	and said , Jehovah , God of Israel , why is it come to pass in Israel , that there should be this day one tribe lacking in Israel ?
DARBY	Judges	21	4	And it came to pass on the morrow , that the people rose early , and built there an altar , and offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings .
DARBY	Judges	21	5	And the children of Israel said , Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation to Jehovah ? For they had [ made ] a great oath concerning him that came not up to Jehovah to Mizpah , saying , He shall certainly be put to death .
DARBY	Judges	21	6	And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother , and said , To-day is one tribe extirpated from Israel .
DARBY	Judges	21	7	What shall we do for wives for them that remain ? since we have sworn by Jehovah that we will not give them of our daughters for wives .
DARBY	Judges	21	8	And they said , What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpah to Jehovah ? And behold , there came none to the camp from Jabesh-Gilead , to the congregation ;
DARBY	Judges	21	9	for the people were numbered , and behold , there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead there .
DARBY	Judges	21	10	And the assembly sent thither twelve thousand men of the most valiant and commanded them , saying , Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead with the edge of the sword , and the women and the children .
DARBY	Judges	21	11	And this is the thing which ye shall do : ye shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman that hath lain with man .
DARBY	Judges	21	12	And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead four hundred young women that were virgins , who had known no man by lying with any male , and they brought them to the camp , to Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan .
DARBY	Judges	21	13	And the whole assembly sent to speak to the children of Benjamin that were at the cliff of Rimmon , and to proclaim peace to them .
DARBY	Judges	21	14	And Benjamin came again at that time ; and they gave them the wives whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-Gilead ; but even so they found not enough for them .
DARBY	Judges	21	15	And the people repented them for Benjamin , because Jehovah had made a breach in the tribes of Israel .
DARBY	Judges	21	16	And the elders of the assembly said , What shall we do for wives for them that remain ? for the women have been destroyed out of Benjamin .
DARBY	Judges	21	17	And they said , There must be a possession for those of Benjamin that have escaped , that a tribe be not blotted out of Israel .
DARBY	Judges	21	18	But we can not give them wives of our daughters , for the children of Israel have sworn , saying , Cursed be he that giveth a wife to the Benjaminites !
DARBY	Judges	21	19	And they said , Behold , there is a feast of Jehovah from year to year in Shiloh , which is on the north side of Bethel , toward the sun-rising of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem , and on the south of Lebonah .
DARBY	Judges	21	20	And they commanded the sons of Benjamin , saying , Go and lie in wait in the vineyards ;
DARBY	Judges	21	22	And it shall be , when their fathers or their brethren come to complain to us , that we will say to them , Gratify us with them , because we did not take each man his wife in the war ; for ye did not give them to them , that ye should now be guilty .
DARBY	Judges	21	23	And the children of Benjamin did so , and took wives , according to their number , of them that danced , whom they caught ; and they went and returned to their inheritance , and built the cities , and dwelt in them .
DARBY	Judges	21	24	And the children of Israel departed thence at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance .
DARBY	Judges	21	25	In those days there was no king in Israel ; every man did what was right in his own eyes .
DARBY	Ruth	1	1	And it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled , that there was a famine in the land . And a certain man went from Bethlehem-Judah , to sojourn in the country of Moab , he , and his wife , and his two sons .
DARBY	Ruth	1	2	And the name of the man was Elimelech , and the name of his wife Naomi , and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion , Ephrathites of Bethlehem-Judah . And they came into the country of Moab , and continued there .
DARBY	Ruth	1	3	And Elimelech Naomi 's husband died ; and she was left , and her two sons .
DARBY	Ruth	1	4	And they took them Moabitish wives ; the name of the one was Orpah , and the name of the second Ruth : and they abode there about ten years .
DARBY	Ruth	1	5	And Mahlon and Chilion died also , both of them ; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband .
DARBY	Ruth	1	6	And she arose , she and her daughters-in-law , and returned from the fields of Moab ; for she had heard in the fields of Moab how that Jehovah had visited his people to give them bread .
DARBY	Ruth	1	7	Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she had been , and her two daughters-in-law with her ; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah .
DARBY	Ruth	1	8	And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law , Go , return each to her mother 's house . Jehovah deal kindly with you , as ye have dealt with the dead and with me .
DARBY	Ruth	1	9	Jehovah grant you that ye may find rest , each in the house of her husband . And she kissed them ; and they lifted up their voice and wept .
DARBY	Ruth	1	10	And they said to her , We will certainly return with thee to thy people .
DARBY	Ruth	1	11	And Naomi said , Return , my daughters : why will ye go with me ? Are there yet sons in my womb , that they could be your husbands ?
DARBY	Ruth	1	12	Return , my daughters , go ; for I am too old to have a husband . If I should say , I have hope , should I even have a husband to-night , and should I also bear sons ,
DARBY	Ruth	1	13	would ye wait on that account till they were grown ? Would ye stay on that account from having husbands ? No , my daughters , for I am in much more bitterness than you ; for the hand of Jehovah is gone out against me .
DARBY	Ruth	1	14	And they lifted up their voice and wept again . And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law , but Ruth clave to her .
DARBY	Ruth	1	15	And she said , Behold , thy sister-in-law is gone back to her people and to her gods : return after thy sister-in-law .
DARBY	Ruth	1	16	And Ruth said , Do not intreat me to leave thee , to return from [ following ] after thee ; for whither thou goest I will go , and where thou lodgest I will lodge : thy people shall be my people , and thy God my God ;
DARBY	Ruth	1	17	where thou diest will I die , and there will I be buried . Jehovah do so to me , and more also , if aught but death part me and thee !
DARBY	Ruth	1	18	And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her , she left off speaking to her .
DARBY	Ruth	1	19	And they two went until they came to Bethlehem . And it came to pass , when they came to Bethlehem , that all the city was moved about them , and the [ women ] said , Is this Naomi ?
DARBY	Ruth	1	20	And she said to them , Call me not Naomi—call me Mara ; for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me .
DARBY	Ruth	1	21	I went out full , and Jehovah has brought me home again empty . Why do ye call me Naomi , seeing Jehovah has brought me low , and the Almighty has afflicted me ?
DARBY	Ruth	1	22	So Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter-in-law , with her , who returned out of the fields of Moab ; and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of the barley-harvest .
DARBY	Ruth	2	2	And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi , Let me , I pray , go to the field and glean among the ears of corn after [ him ] in whose sight I shall find favour . And she said to her , Go , my daughter .
DARBY	Ruth	2	3	And she went ; and she came and gleaned in the fields after the reapers ; and she chanced to light on an allotment of Boaz , who was of the family of Elimelech .
DARBY	Ruth	2	4	And behold , Boaz came from Bethlehem ; and he said to the reapers , Jehovah be with you ! And they said to him , Jehovah bless thee !
DARBY	Ruth	2	5	And Boaz said to his servant that was set over the reapers , Whose maiden is this ?
DARBY	Ruth	2	6	And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said , It is the Moabitish maiden who came back with Naomi out of the fields of Moab ;
DARBY	Ruth	2	7	and she said , I pray you , let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers . And she came , and has continued from the morning until now : her sitting in the house has been little as yet .
DARBY	Ruth	2	8	And Boaz said to Ruth , Hearest thou not , my daughter ? Go not to glean in another field , neither go from here , but keep here with my maidens .
DARBY	Ruth	2	9	Let thine eyes be on the field which is being reaped , and go thou after them ; have I not charged the young men not to touch thee ? And when thou art athirst , go to the vessels and drink of what the young men draw .
DARBY	Ruth	2	10	Then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said to him , Why have I found favour in thine eyes , that thou shouldest regard me , seeing I am a foreigner ?
DARBY	Ruth	2	11	And Boaz answered and said to her , It has fully been shewn me , all that thou hast done to thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband ; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother , and the land of thy nativity , and art come to a people that thou hast not known heretofore .
DARBY	Ruth	2	12	Jehovah recompense thy work , and let thy reward be full from Jehovah the God of Israel , under whose wings thou art come to take refuge .
DARBY	Ruth	2	13	And she said , Let me find favour in thine eyes , my lord ; for that thou hast comforted me , and for that thou hast spoken kindly to thy handmaid , though I am not like one of thy handmaidens .
DARBY	Ruth	2	14	And Boaz said to her at mealtime , Come hither and eat of the bread , and dip thy morsel in the vinegar . And she sat beside the reapers ; and he reached her parched corn , and she ate and was sufficed , and reserved [ some ] .
DARBY	Ruth	2	15	And when she rose up to glean , Boaz commanded his young men , saying , Let her glean even among the sheaves , and ye shall not reproach her .
DARBY	Ruth	2	16	And ye shall also sometimes draw out for her [ some ears ] out of the handfuls , and leave them that she may glean , and rebuke her not .
DARBY	Ruth	2	17	And she gleaned in the field until even , and beat out what she had gleaned ; and it was about an ephah of barley .
DARBY	Ruth	2	18	And she took [ it ] up , and came into the city , and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned ; and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had reserved after she was sufficed .
DARBY	Ruth	2	19	And her mother-in-law said to her , Where hast thou gleaned to-day ? and where hast thou wrought ? Blessed be he that did regard thee ! And she told her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought , and said , The man 's name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz .
DARBY	Ruth	2	20	And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law , Blessed be he of Jehovah , who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead ! And Naomi said to her , The man is near of kin to us , one of those who have the right of our redemption .
DARBY	Ruth	2	21	And Ruth the Moabitess said , He said to me also , Thou shalt keep with my young men until they have ended all my harvest .
DARBY	Ruth	2	22	And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law , It is good , my daughter , that thou go out with his maidens , that they meet thee not in any other field .
DARBY	Ruth	2	23	So she kept with the maidens of Boaz to glean , until the end of the barley-harvest and of the wheat-harvest . And she dwelt with her mother-in-law .
DARBY	Ruth	3	3	Wash thyself therefore , and anoint thyself , and put thy raiment upon thee , and go down to the floor ; make not thyself known to the man , until he shall have done eating and drinking .
DARBY	Ruth	3	2	And now , is not Boaz of our kindred , with whose maidens thou wast ? Behold , he is winnowing barley in the threshing-floor to-night .
DARBY	Ruth	3	4	And it shall be , when he lies down , that thou shalt mark the place where he shall have lain down , and thou shalt go in , and uncover his feet , and lay thyself down ; and he will shew thee what thou shalt do .
DARBY	Ruth	3	5	And she said to her , All that thou sayest will I do .
DARBY	Ruth	3	6	And she went down to the floor , and did according to all that her mother-in-law had bidden her .
DARBY	Ruth	3	7	And Boaz ate and drank , and his heart was merry , and he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn . Then she went softly , and uncovered his feet , and laid herself down .
DARBY	Ruth	3	8	And it came to pass at midnight , that the man was startled , and turned himself ; and behold , a woman lay at his feet .
DARBY	Ruth	3	9	And he said , Who art thou ? And she answered , I am Ruth , thy handmaid : spread thy skirt over thy handmaid ; for thou hast the right of redemption .
DARBY	Ruth	3	10	And he said , Blessed be thou of Jehovah , my daughter ! Thou hast shewn more kindness at the end than at the first , inasmuch as thou followedst not young men , whether poor or rich .
DARBY	Ruth	3	11	And now , my daughter , fear not : all that thou sayest will I do to thee ; for all the gate of my people knows that thou art a woman of worth .
DARBY	Ruth	3	12	And now , truly I am one that has the right of redemption , yet there is one that has the right of redemption who is nearer than I .
DARBY	Ruth	3	13	Stay over to-night , and it shall be in the morning , if he will redeem thee , well—let him redeem ; but if he like not to redeem thee , then will I redeem thee , [ as ] Jehovah liveth . Lie down until the morning .
DARBY	Ruth	3	14	And she lay at his feet until the morning ; and she rose up before one could know another . And he said , Let it not be known that a woman came into the threshing-floor .
DARBY	Ruth	3	15	And he said , Bring the cloak that thou hast upon thee , and hold it . And she held it , and he measured six [ measures ] of barley , and laid [ it ] on her ; and he went into the city .
DARBY	Ruth	3	16	And she came to her mother-in-law ; and she said , Who art thou , my daughter ? And she told her all that the man had done to her .
DARBY	Ruth	3	17	And she said , These six [ measures ] of barley gave he me ; for he said to me , Go not empty to thy mother-in-law .
DARBY	Ruth	3	18	Then she said , Be still , my daughter , until thou know how the matter will fall ; for the man will not rest until he have completed the matter this day .
DARBY	Ruth	4	4	And I thought I would apprise thee of it and say , Buy [ it ] in the presence of the inhabitants , and in the presence of the elders of my people . If thou wilt redeem [ it ] , redeem ; but if thou wilt not redeem , tell me , that I may know ; for there is none to redeem besides thee ; and I am after thee . And he said , I will redeem [ it ] .
DARBY	Ruth	4	2	And he took ten men of the elders of the city , and said , Sit down here . And they sat down .
DARBY	Ruth	4	3	And he said to him that had the right of redemption : Naomi , who is come back out of the country of Moab , sells the allotment that was our brother Elimelech 's .
DARBY	Ruth	4	5	And Boaz said , On the day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi , thou must buy [ it ] also of Ruth the Moabitess , the wife of the dead , to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance .
DARBY	Ruth	4	6	And he that had the right of redemption said , I can not redeem [ it ] for myself , lest I mar mine own inheritance . Redeem thou for thyself what I should redeem , for I can not redeem [ it ] .
DARBY	Ruth	4	7	Now this [ was the custom ] in former time in Israel concerning redemption and concerning exchange , to confirm the whole matter : a man drew off his sandal , and gave it to his neighbour , and this was the [ mode of ] attestation in Israel .
DARBY	Ruth	4	8	And he that had the right of redemption said to Boaz , Buy for thyself ; and he drew off his sandal .
DARBY	Ruth	4	9	And Boaz said to the elders and all the people , Ye are witnesses this day , that I have bought all that was Elimelech 's , and all that was Chilion 's and Mahlon 's , of the hand of Naomi ;
DARBY	Ruth	4	10	moreover Ruth the Moabitess , the wife of Mahlon , have I purchased to be my wife , to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance , that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place : ye are witnesses this day .
DARBY	Ruth	4	11	And all the people that were in the gate and the elders said , [ We are ] witnesses . Jehovah make the woman that cometh into thy house like Rachel and like Leah , which two did build the house of Israel ; and acquire power in Ephratah , and make thyself a name in Bethlehem ;
DARBY	Ruth	4	12	and let thy house become like the house of Pherez , whom Tamar bore to Judah , of the seed which Jehovah shall give thee of this young woman .
DARBY	Ruth	4	13	And Boaz took Ruth , and she became his wife ; and he went in unto her , and Jehovah gave her conception , and she bore a son .
DARBY	Ruth	4	14	And the women said to Naomi , Blessed be Jehovah who hath not left thee this day without one that has the right of redemption , and may his name be famous in Israel !
DARBY	Ruth	4	15	And he shall be to thee a restorer of thy life , and a nourisher of thine old age ; for thy daughter-in-law who loves thee , who is better to thee than seven sons , has borne him .
DARBY	Ruth	4	16	And Naomi took the child , and laid it in her bosom , and became nurse to it .
DARBY	Ruth	4	17	And the women [ her ] neighbours gave it a name , saying , There is a son born to Naomi . And they called his name Obed . He is the father of Jesse , the father of David .
DARBY	Ruth	4	18	Now these are the generations of Pherez . Pherez begot Hezron ,
DARBY	Ruth	4	19	and Hezron begot Ram , and Ram begot Amminadab ,
DARBY	Ruth	4	20	and Amminadab begot Nahshon , and Nahshon begot Salmon ,
DARBY	Ruth	4	21	and Salmon begot Boaz , and Boaz begot Obed ,
DARBY	Ruth	4	22	and Obed begot Jesse , and Jesse begot David .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	1	And there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim , of mount Ephraim , and his name was Elkanah , the son of Jeroham , the son of Elihu , the son of Tohu , the son of Zuph , an Ephrathite .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	2	And he had two wives : the name of the one was Hannah , and the name of the other Peninnah ; and Peninnah had children , but Hannah had no children .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	3	And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of hosts in Shiloh . And the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , the priests of Jehovah , were there .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	4	And it came to pass on the day that Elkanah sacrificed , he gave to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions ;
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	5	but to Hannah he used to give a double portion , for he loved Hannah ; but Jehovah had shut up her womb .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	6	And her adversary provoked her much also , to make her fret , because Jehovah had shut up her womb .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	7	And [ as ] he did so year by year , as often as she went up to the house of Jehovah , she provoked her thus ; and she wept and did not eat .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	8	And Elkanah her husband said to her , Hannah , why weepest thou ? and why eatest thou not ? and why is thy heart grieved ? Am not I better to thee than ten sons ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	9	And Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh , and after they had drunk ; ( now Eli the priest sat upon the seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah ; )
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	10	and she was in bitterness of soul , and prayed to Jehovah , and wept much .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	11	And she vowed a vow , and said , O Jehovah of hosts , if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid , and remember me , and not forget thy handmaid , but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man child , then I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life , and there shall no razor come upon his head .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	12	And it came to pass as she continued praying before Jehovah , that Eli marked her mouth .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	13	Now Hannah spoke in her heart ; only her lips moved , but her voice was not heard ; and Eli thought she was drunken .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	14	And Eli said to her , How long wilt thou be drunken ? put away thy wine from thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	15	And Hannah answered and said , No , my lord , I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit : I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink , but have poured out my soul before Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	16	Take not thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial : for out of the abundance of my grief and provocation have I spoken hitherto .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	17	And Eli answered and said , Go in peace ; and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition which thou hast asked of him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	18	And she said , Let thy bondwoman find grace in thy sight . And the woman went her way , and did eat , and her countenance was no more [ as before ] .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	19	And they rose up early in the morning and worshipped before Jehovah , and returned and came to their house at Ramah . And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife ; and Jehovah remembered her .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	20	And it came to pass when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived , that she bore a son , and called his name Samuel , [ saying , ] Because I have asked him of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	21	And Elkanah her husband , and all his house , went up to sacrifice to Jehovah the yearly sacrifice and his vow .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	22	But Hannah did not go up , for she said to her husband , [ I will wait ] until the child is weaned ; then will I bring him , that he may appear before Jehovah , and there abide for ever .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	23	And Elkanah her husband said to her , Do what is good in thy sight : abide until thou hast weaned him ; only , may Jehovah fulfil his word . And the woman abode , and gave her son suck until she weaned him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	24	And she took him up with her when she had weaned him , with three bullocks , and one ephah of flour , and a flask of wine , and brought him to the house of Jehovah to Shiloh ; and the boy was young .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	25	And they slaughtered the bullock , and brought the boy to Eli .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	26	And she said , Oh my lord , [ as ] thy soul liveth , my lord , I am the woman that stood by thee here to pray to Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	27	For this boy I prayed ; and Jehovah has granted me my petition which I asked of him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	1	28	And also I have lent him to Jehovah : all the days that he lives , he is lent to Jehovah . And he worshipped Jehovah there .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	2	There is none holy as Jehovah , for there is none beside thee , neither is there any rock like our God .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	3	Do not multiply your words of pride , let not vain-glory come out of your mouth ; For Jehovah is a God of knowledge , and by him actions are weighed .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	4	The bow of the mighty is broken , and they that stumbled are girded with strength .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	5	They that were full have hired themselves out for bread ; and the hungry are [ so ] no more : Even the barren beareth seven , and she that hath many children is waxed feeble .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	6	Jehovah killeth , and maketh alive ; he bringeth down to Sheol , and bringeth up .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	7	Jehovah maketh poor , and maketh rich , he bringeth low , also he lifteth up :
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	8	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust ; from the dung-hill he lifteth up the needy , To set [ him ] among nobles ; and he maketh them inherit a throne of glory ; For the pillars of the earth are Jehovah 's , and he hath set the world upon them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	9	He keepeth the feet of his saints , but the wicked are silenced in darkness ; for by strength shall no man prevail .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	10	They that strive with Jehovah shall be broken to pieces ; in the heavens will he thunder upon them . Jehovah will judge the ends of the earth ; and he will give strength unto his king , and exalt the horn of his anointed .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	11	And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house . And the boy ministered to Jehovah in the presence of Eli the priest .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	12	Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial ; they knew not Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	13	And the priests ' custom with the people was , when any man sacrificed a sacrifice , the priest 's servant came , when the flesh was cooked , with a flesh-hook of three prongs in his hand ;
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	14	and he struck it into the pan , or kettle , or cauldron , or pot ; the priest took of it all that the flesh-hook brought up . So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came there .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	15	Even before they burned the fat , the priest 's servant came , and said to the man that sacrificed , Give flesh to roast for the priest , and he will not accept sodden flesh of thee , but raw .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	16	If the man said to him , They will immediately burn the fat entire , then take as thy soul desires ; he would say [ to him ] , No , but thou shalt give [ it ] now ; and if not , I will take [ it ] by force .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	17	And the sin of the young men was very great before Jehovah , for men despised the offering of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	18	And Samuel ministered before Jehovah , a boy girded with a linen ephod .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	19	And his mother made him a little coat , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to sacrifice the yearly sacrifice .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	20	And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife , and said , Jehovah give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to Jehovah . And they went to their own home .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	21	So Jehovah visited Hannah , and she conceived , and bore three sons and two daughters . And the boy Samuel grew before Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	22	And Eli was very old , and heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel , and that they lay with the women that served at the entrance of the tent of meeting .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	23	And he said to them , Why do ye such things ? for I hear of your evil deeds from all this people .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	24	No , my sons , for it is no good report that I hear : ye make Jehovah 's people transgress .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	25	If one man sin against another , God will judge him ; but if a man sin against Jehovah , who shall intreat for him ? But they hearkened not to the voice of their father , for Jehovah was minded to slay them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	26	And the boy Samuel grew on , and was in favour both with Jehovah and also with men .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	27	And there came a man of God to Eli and said to him , Thus saith Jehovah : Did I plainly reveal myself to the house of thy father when they were in Egypt , in Pharaoh 's house ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	28	and choose him out of all the tribes of Israel , to be my priest , to offer upon mine altar , to burn incense , to wear the ephod before me ? and I gave unto the house of thy father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	29	Wherefore do ye trample upon my sacrifice and upon mine oblation which I have commanded [ in my ] habitation ? And thou honourest thy sons above me , to make yourselves fat with the primest of all the oblations of Israel my people .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	30	Wherefore Jehovah the God of Israel saith , I said indeed , Thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever . But now Jehovah saith , Be it far from me ; for them that honour me I will honour , and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	31	Behold , days come , that I will cut off thine arm , and the arm of thy father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in thy house .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	32	And thou shalt see an oppressor [ in my ] habitation , amidst all the good that shall be done to Israel ; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	33	And the man of thine [ whom ] I shall not cut off from mine altar , shall be to cause thine eyes to fail and to grieve thy soul ; and all the increase of thy house shall die in their vigour .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	34	And this shall be the sign to thee , which shall come upon thy two sons , upon Hophni and Phinehas : in one day they shall die , both of them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	35	And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest , [ who ] shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind ; and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine anointed continually .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	2	36	And it shall come to pass [ that ] every one that is left of thy house shall come to crouch to him for a small piece of silver and for a cake of bread , and shall say , Put me , I pray thee , into one of the priestly offices , that I may eat a morsel of bread .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	3	and the lamp of God had not yet gone out , and Samuel lay in the temple of Jehovah , where the ark of God was ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	2	And it came to pass at that time , when Eli lay in his place ( now his eyes began to grow dim , he could not see ) ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	4	that Jehovah called to Samuel . And he said , Here am I .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	5	And he ran to Eli , and said , Here am I ; for thou calledst me . And he said , I did not call : lie down again . And he went and lay down .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	6	And Jehovah called again , Samuel ! And Samuel arose and went to Eli , and said , Here am I ; for thou calledst me . And he said , I did not call , my son : lie down again .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	7	Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah , neither had the word of Jehovah yet been revealed to him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	8	And Jehovah called again the third time , Samuel ! And he arose and went to Eli , and said , Here am I ; for thou calledst me . And Eli perceived that Jehovah was calling the boy .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	9	And Eli said to Samuel , Go , lie down ; and it shall be , if he call thee , that thou shalt say , Speak , Jehovah , for thy servant heareth . So Samuel went and lay down in his place .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	10	And Jehovah came , and stood , and called as at the other times , Samuel , Samuel ! And Samuel said , Speak , for thy servant heareth .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	11	And Jehovah said to Samuel , Behold , I do a thing in Israel , at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	12	In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house ; I will begin and make an end .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	13	For I have declared to him that I will judge his house for ever , for the iniquity which he hath known : because his sons made themselves vile , and he restrained them not .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	14	And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli 's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice or oblation for ever .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	15	And Samuel lay until the morning , and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah . And Samuel feared to declare the vision to Eli .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	16	And Eli called Samuel , and said , Samuel , my son . And he said , Here am I .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	17	And he said , What is the word that he has spoken to thee ? I pray thee , keep it not back from me : God do so to thee , and more also , if thou keep back anything from me of all the word that he spoke to thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	18	And Samuel told him all the words , and kept nothing back from him . And he said , It is Jehovah : let him do what is good in his sight .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	19	And Samuel grew , and Jehovah was with him , and let none of his words fall to the ground .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	20	And all Israel , from Dan even to Beer-sheba , knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	3	21	And Jehovah appeared again at Shiloh ; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	4	So the people sent to Shiloh , and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of Jehovah of hosts , who sitteth between the cherubim ; and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , were there by the ark of the covenant of God .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	2	And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel ; and the battle spread , and Israel was routed before the Philistines ; and they slew in battle array in the field about four thousand men .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	3	And the people came into the camp ; and the elders of Israel said , Why has Jehovah smitten us to-day before the Philistines ? Let us fetch ourselves the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of Shiloh , that it may come among us , and save us out of the hand of our enemies .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	5	And it came to pass when the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came into the camp , that all Israel shouted with a great shout , so that the earth shook .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	6	And the Philistines heard the noise of the shout , and said , What is the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews ? And they understood that the ark of Jehovah had come into the camp .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	7	And the Philistines were afraid , for they said , God is come into the camp . And they said , Woe unto us ! for there has not been such a thing heretofore .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	8	Woe unto us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods ? these are the gods that smote the Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	9	Shew yourselves valiant and be men , ye Philistines , that ye may not have to be servants to the Hebrews , as they have been servants to you : be men , and fight .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	10	And the Philistines fought , and Israel was routed , and they fled every man to his tent ; and there was a very great slaughter , and there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	11	And the ark of God was taken ; and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , died .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	12	And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the battle , and came to Shiloh the same day , with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	13	And when he came , behold , Eli was sitting upon the seat by the way-side watching ; for his heart trembled for the ark of God . And the man came to tell it in the city , and all the city cried out .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	14	And Eli heard the noise of the crying , and said , What is the noise of this tumult ? And the man came hastily , and told Eli .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	15	Now Eli was ninety-eight years old ; and his eyes were set , that he could not see .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	16	And the man said to Eli , I am he that came out of the battle , and I have fled to-day out of the battle . And he said , What has taken place , my son ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	17	And the messenger answered and said , Israel has fled before the Philistines , and there has been also a great slaughter among the people , and thy two sons also , Hophni and Phinehas , are dead , and the ark of God is taken .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	18	And it came to pass , when he mentioned the ark of God , that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate , and his neck broke , and he died ; for the man was old , and heavy . And he had judged Israel forty years .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	19	And his daughter-in-law , Phinehas ' wife , was with child , near to be delivered ; and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken , and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead , she bowed herself and travailed ; for her pains came upon her .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	20	And as she was dying , the women that stood by her said , Fear not ; for thou hast borne a son . But she did not answer , neither did she take it to heart .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	21	And she named the child Ichabod , saying , The glory is departed from Israel ; because the ark of God was taken , and because of her father-in-law and her husband .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	4	22	And she said , The glory is departed from Israel , for the ark of God is taken .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	5	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	5	5	Therefore neither the priests of Dagon nor any that come into Dagon 's house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	5	2	And the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon , and set it by Dagon .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	5	3	And when they of Ashdod arose early the next day , behold , Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah . And they took Dagon , and set him in his place again .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	5	4	And when they arose early the next morning , behold , Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Jehovah ; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold ; only the fish-stump was left to him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	5	6	And the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod , and he laid them waste , and smote them with hemorrhoids , —Ashdod and its borders .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	5	7	And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so , they said , The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us ; for his hand is severe upon us , and upon Dagon our god .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	5	8	And they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them , and said , What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel ? And they said , Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath . And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about [ thither ] .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	5	9	And it came to pass that , after they had carried it about , the hand of Jehovah was against the city with very great panic ; and he smote the men of the city , both small and great , and hemorrhoids broke out upon them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	5	10	And they sent the ark of God to Ekron . And it came to pass , when the ark of God came to Ekron , that the Ekronites cried out , saying , They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us , to kill us and our people .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	5	11	And they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines , and said , Send away the ark of the God of Israel , and let it go again to its own place , that it kill us not , and our people . For there was deadly alarm throughout the city : the hand of God was very heavy there ;
DARBY	1%20Samuel	5	12	and the men that died not were smitten with the hemorrhoids ; and the cry of the city went up to heaven .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	6	And why will ye harden your heart , as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their heart ? When he had wrought mightily among them , did they not let them go , and they departed ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	2	And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners , saying , What shall we do with the ark of Jehovah ? tell us wherewith we shall send it to its place .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	3	And they said , If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel , send it not empty ; ye must at any rate return him a trespass-offering : then ye shall be healed , and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	4	Then they said , What is the trespass-offering which we shall return to him ? And they said , Five golden hemorrhoids , and five golden mice , the number of the lords of the Philistines ; for one plague is upon them all , and upon your lords .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	5	And ye shall make images of your hemorrhoids , and images of your mice that destroy the land , and give glory to the God of Israel : perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	7	And now make a new cart , and take two milch kine , on which there has come no yoke , and tie the kine to the cart , and bring their calves home from them ;
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	8	and take the ark of Jehovah , and lay it upon the cart , and the golden jewels , which ye return him as a trespass-offering , put in the coffer by the side thereof ; and send it away that it may go .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	9	And see , if it go up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh , it is he who has done us this great evil ; if not , then we shall know that it is not his hand that touched us ; it was a chance [ that ] happened to us .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	10	And the men did so , and took two milch kine , and tied them to the cart , and shut up their calves at home .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	11	And they laid the ark of Jehovah upon the cart , and the coffer with the golden mice and the images of their sores .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	12	And the kine went straight forward on the way to Beth-shemesh ; they went by the one high way , lowing as they went ; and they turned not aside to the right hand or to the left ; and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	13	And [ they of ] Beth-shemesh were reaping the wheat-harvest in the valley ; and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark , and rejoiced to see it .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	14	And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemeshite , and stood there ; and a great stone was there . And they clave the wood of the cart , and offered up the kine as a burnt-offering to Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	15	And the Levites took down the ark of Jehovah , and the coffer that was with it , in which were the golden jewels , and put them on the great stone ; and the men of Beth-shemesh offered up burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	16	And the five lords of the Philistines saw [ it ] , and returned to Ekron the same day .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	17	And these are the golden sores which the Philistines returned as a trespass-offering to Jehovah : for Ashdod one , for Gazah one , for Ashkelon one , for Gath one , for Ekron one ;
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	18	and the golden mice , [ according to ] the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords , both fortified cities and villages of the peasantry ; [ and they brought them ] as far as the great [ stone of ] Abel , whereon they set down the ark of Jehovah , [ which ] is to this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemeshite .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	19	And he smote among the men of Beth-shemesh , because they had looked into the ark of Jehovah , and smote of the people seventy men ; and the people lamented , because Jehovah had smitten the people with a great slaughter .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	20	And the men of Beth-shemesh said , Who is able to stand before Jehovah , this holy God ? and to whom shall he go up from us ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	6	21	And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim , saying , The Philistines have brought again the ark of Jehovah ; come down , fetch it up to you .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	7	And the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah ; and the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel ; and the children of Israel heard [ it ] , and were afraid of the Philistines .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	2	And it came to pass , from the day that the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years . And all the house of Israel lamented after Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	3	And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel , saying , If ye return to Jehovah with all your heart , put away the strange gods and the Ashtoreths from among you , and apply your hearts unto Jehovah , and serve him only ; and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	4	And the children of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtoreths and served Jehovah only .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	5	And Samuel said , Gather all Israel to Mizpah , and I will pray Jehovah for you .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	6	And they gathered together to Mizpah , and drew water , and poured it out before Jehovah , and fasted on that day , and said there , We have sinned against Jehovah . And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	8	And the children of Israel said to Samuel , Cease not to cry to Jehovah our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	9	And Samuel took a sucking-lamb , and offered it as a whole burnt-offering to Jehovah ; and Samuel cried to Jehovah for Israel , and Jehovah answered him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	10	And as Samuel was offering up the burnt-offering , the Philistines advanced to battle against Israel . And Jehovah thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines , and discomfited them ; and they were routed before Israel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	11	And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah , and pursued the Philistines , and smote them , as far as below Beth-car .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	12	And Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen , and called the name of it Eben-ezer , and said , Hitherto Jehovah has helped us .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	13	And the Philistines were subdued , and came no more into the borders of Israel ; and the hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	14	And the cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel , from Ekron even to Gath ; and their territory did Israel deliver out of the hand of the Philistines . And there was peace between Israel and the Amorite .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	15	And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	16	And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel , and Gilgal , and Mizpah , and judged Israel in all those places .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	7	17	And his return was to Ramah ; for there was his house , and there he judged Israel ; and there he built an altar to Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	8	According to all the deeds that they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day , in that they have forsaken me and served other gods , so do they also unto thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	2	And the name of his firstborn was Joel ; and the name of his second , Abijah ; they judged in Beer-sheba .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	3	And his sons walked not in his ways , but turned aside after lucre , and took bribes , and perverted justice .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	4	Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together , and came to Samuel to Ramah ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	5	and said to him , Behold , thou art become old , and thy sons walk not in thy ways : now appoint us a king to judge us , like all the nations .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	6	And the thing displeased Samuel , when they said , Give us a king to judge us . And Samuel prayed to Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	7	And Jehovah said to Samuel , Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee : for they have not rejected thee , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	9	And now hearken unto their voice ; only , testify solemnly unto them , and declare unto them the manner of the king that shall reign over them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	10	And Samuel spoke all the words of Jehovah to the people that asked of him a king .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	11	And he said , This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , on his chariot and among his horsemen , and they shall run before his chariots ;
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	12	and [ he will take them ] that he may appoint for himself captains over thousands , and captains over fifties , and that they may plough his ground , and reap his harvest , and make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	13	And he will take your daughters for perfumers , and cooks , and bakers .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	14	And your fields , and your vineyards , and your oliveyards , the best , will he take and give to his servants .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	15	And he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards , and give to his chamberlains and to his servants .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	16	And he will take your bondmen , and your bondwomen , and your comeliest young men , and your asses , and use them for his work .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	17	He will take the tenth of your sheep . And ye shall be his servants .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	18	And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye have chosen ; and Jehovah will not answer you in that day .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	19	And the people refused to hearken to the voice of Samuel ; and they said , No , but there shall be a king over us ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	20	that we also may be like all the nations ; and our king shall judge us , and go out before us , and conduct our wars .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	21	And Samuel heard all the words of the people , and he repeated them in the ears of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	8	22	And Jehovah said to Samuel , Hearken unto their voice , and make them a king . And Samuel said to the men of Israel , Go ye every man to his city .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	9	( In former time in Israel , when a man went to ask counsel of God , he said , Come and let us go to the seer ; for he that is now called a Prophet was in former time called a Seer . )
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	2	And he had a son whose name was Saul , choice and comely ; and there was not among the children of Israel a comelier person than he ; from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	3	And the asses of Kish Saul 's father were lost ; and Kish said to Saul his son , Take , I pray , one of the young men with thee , and arise , go seek the asses .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	4	And he passed through mount Ephraim , and passed through the land of Shalishah , but they found [ them ] not ; and they passed through the land of Shaalim , and they were not there ; and they passed through the land of Benjamin , and they found [ them ] not .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	5	They had come to the land of Zuph when Saul said to his servant that was with him , Come and let us return ; lest my father give up the asses , and be anxious about us .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	6	And he said to him , Behold now , a man of God is in this city , and the man is held in honour ; all that he says comes surely to pass . Let us now go thither : perhaps he will shew us the way that we should go .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	7	And Saul said to his servant , But if we go , what shall we bring the man ? for the bread is spent in our vessels , and we have no present to give to the man of God : what have we ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	8	And the servant answered Saul again and said , Behold , I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver ; that will I give to the man of God , to tell us our way .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	10	And Saul said to his servant , Well said : come , let us go . So they went to the city where the man of God was .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	11	As they went up the ascent to the city , they met maidens going forth to draw water ; and they said to them , Is the seer here ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	12	And they answered them and said , He is ; behold , he is before thee : make haste now , for he came to-day to the city ; for the people have a sacrifice to-day in the high place .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	13	As soon as ye come into the city , ye shall straightway find him , before he goes up to the high place to eat ; for the people eat not until he has come , because he blesses the sacrifice ; afterwards they eat that are invited . And now go up ; for this very day shall ye find him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	14	And they went up into the city . As they were coming into the midst of the city , behold , Samuel was coming out towards them , to go up to the high place .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	15	Now Jehovah had apprised Samuel one day before Saul came , saying ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	16	To-morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin , and thou shalt anoint him prince over my people Israel ; and he will save my people out of the hand of the Philistines ; for I have looked upon my people , because their cry is come unto me .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	17	And as Samuel saw Saul , Jehovah answered him , Behold the man of whom I spoke to thee ! this man shall rule over my people .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	18	And Saul drew near to Samuel in the midst of the gate , and said , Tell me , I pray thee , where the seer 's house is .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	19	And Samuel answered Saul and said , I am the seer : go up before me to the high place , and ye shall eat with me to-day ; and to-morrow I will let thee go , and will tell thee all that is in thy heart .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	20	And as for the asses that thou didst lose three days ago , set not thy heart on them ; for they are found . And on whom is all the desire of Israel [ set ] ? Is it not on thee , and on all thy father 's house ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	21	And Saul answered and said , Am not I a Benjaminite , of the smallest of the tribes of Israel , and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin ? and why dost thou speak such words to me ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	22	And Samuel took Saul and his servant , and brought them into the chamber , and gave them a place at the head of them that were invited ; and they were about thirty persons .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	23	And Samuel said to the cook , Bring the portion that I gave thee , of which I said to thee , Set it by thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	24	And the cook took up the shoulder , and what was on it , and set [ it ] before Saul . And he said , Behold that which has been reserved ! set it before thee , eat ; for against the set time has it been kept for thee , since I said , I will invite the people . So Saul ate with Samuel that day .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	25	And they came down from the high place into the city , and he spoke with Saul upon the roof .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	26	And they arose early ; and when it was about the dawning of the day , Samuel called to Saul on the roof , saying , Arise , that I may send thee away . And Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , into the street .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	9	27	As they were going down to the end of the city , Samuel said to Saul , Tell the servant to pass on before us ( and he passed on ) , but stand thou still now , that I may cause thee to hear the word of God .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	10	And when they came thither to the hill , behold , a company of prophets met him ; and the Spirit of God came upon him , and he prophesied among them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	2	When thou goest from me to-day , thou shalt meet two men by Rachel 's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah ; and they will say to thee , The asses are found which thou wentest to seek , and behold , thy father has dismissed the matter of the asses , and is anxious about you , saying , What shall I do for my son ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	3	And thou shalt go on forward from thence , and shalt come to the oak of Tabor , and there shall meet thee three men going up to God , to Bethel , one carrying three kids , and another carrying three cakes of bread , and another carrying a flask of wine .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	4	And they will ask after thy welfare , and give thee two loaves , which thou shalt receive of their hands .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	5	After that thou shalt come to the hill of God , where are the outposts of the Philistines ; and it shall come to pass , when thou comest thither , into the city , that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with lute and tambour and pipe and harp before them ; and they themselves prophesying .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	6	And the Spirit of Jehovah will come upon thee , and thou shalt prophesy with them , and shalt be turned into another man .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	7	And it shall be , when these signs shall come to thee , thou shalt do as thy hand shall find ; for God is with thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	8	And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal ; and behold , I will come down to thee , to offer up burnt-offerings , [ and ] to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings : seven days shalt thou wait , until I come to thee and inform thee what thou shalt do .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	9	And it was [ so ] that when he turned his back to go away from Samuel , God gave him another heart ; and all those signs came to pass that day .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	11	And it came to pass , when all that knew him before saw that , behold , he prophesied among the prophets , then the people said one to another , What is this that has happened to the son of Kish ? Is Saul also among the prophets ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	12	And a man of that place answered and said , But who is their father ? Therefore it became a proverb , Is Saul also among the prophets ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	13	And when he had ended prophesying , he came to the high place .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	14	And Saul 's uncle said to him and to his servant , Whither went ye ? And he said , To seek the asses ; and when we saw that they were nowhere , we went to Samuel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	15	And Saul 's uncle said , Tell me , I pray thee , what Samuel said to you .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	16	And Saul said to his uncle , He told us for certain that the asses were found . But of the matter of the kingdom , of which Samuel had spoken , he told him not .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	17	And Samuel called the people together to Jehovah to Mizpah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	18	And he said to the children of Israel , Thus saith Jehovah , the God of Israel , * I * brought up Israel out of Egypt , and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you ;
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	19	but * ye * have this day rejected your God , who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your troubles , and have said unto him , [ Nay , ] but a king shalt thou set over us . Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes , and by your thousands .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	20	And Samuel caused all the tribes of Israel to come near , and the tribe of Benjamin was taken .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	21	And he caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families , and the family of Matri was taken ; and Saul the son of Kish was taken . And they sought him , but he was not to be found .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	22	Therefore they inquired of Jehovah further , Will the man yet come hither ? And Jehovah answered , Behold , he hath hid himself among the baggage .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	23	And they ran and fetched him thence ; and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	24	And Samuel said to all the people , See ye him whom Jehovah has chosen , that there is none like him among all the people ? And all the people shouted and said , May the king live .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	25	And Samuel told the people the right of the kingdom , and wrote it in the book , and laid it before Jehovah . And Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	26	And Saul also went home to Gibeah ; and with him went the band , whose hearts God had touched .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	10	27	But the children of Belial said , How should this man save us ? And they despised him , and brought him no gifts . But he was as one deaf .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	11	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	11	11	And it came to pass the next day that Saul set the people in three companies ; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch , and smote Ammon until the heat of the day : and it came to pass that they who remained were scattered , and not two of them were left together .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	11	2	And Nahash the Ammonite said to them , On this [ condition ] will I treat with you , that I thrust out all your right eyes , and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	11	3	And the elders of Jabesh said to him , Allow us seven days , and we will send messengers into all the districts of Israel ; and if there be no man to deliver us , we will come out to thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	11	4	And the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and told these words in the ears of the people . And all the people lifted up their voice and wept .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	11	5	And behold , Saul came after the oxen from the field ; and Saul said , What [ aileth ] the people that they weep ? And they related to him the words of the men of Jabesh .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	11	6	And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those words , and his anger was kindled greatly .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	11	7	And he took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces , and sent throughout the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers , saying , Whoever comes not forth after Saul and after Samuel , so shall it be done to his oxen ! And the fear of Jehovah fell on the people , and they came out as one man .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	11	8	And he numbered them in Bezek , and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand , and the men of Judah thirty thousand .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	11	9	And they said to the messengers that had come , Thus shall ye say to the men of Jabesh-Gilead : To-morrow ye shall have deliverance when the sun is hot . And the messengers came and informed the men of Jabesh-Gilead ; and they were glad .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	11	10	And the men of Jabesh said , To-morrow we will come out to you , and ye may do with us according to all that is good in your sight .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	11	12	And the people said to Samuel , Who is he that said , Shall Saul reign over us ? bring the men , that we may put them to death .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	11	13	But Saul said , There shall not a man be put to death this day ; for to-day Jehovah has wrought deliverance in Israel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	11	14	And Samuel said to the people , Come and let us go to Gilgal , and renew the kingdom there .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	11	15	And all the people went to Gilgal ; and there they made Saul king before Jehovah in Gilgal ; and there they sacrificed peace-offerings before Jehovah . And there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced exceedingly .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	12	But when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you , ye said to me , Nay , but a king shall reign over us ; when Jehovah your God was your king .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	2	And now behold , the king walks before you ; and I am old and grey-headed ; and behold , my sons are with you ; and I have walked before you from my youth up to this day .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	3	Here I am : testify against me before Jehovah , and before his anointed . Whose ox have I taken ? or whose ass have I taken ? or whom have I defrauded ? whom have I injured ? or of whose hand have I received any ransom and blinded mine eyes therewith ? and I will restore it to you .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	4	And they said , Thou hast not defrauded us , and thou hast not injured us , neither hast thou taken aught of any man 's hand .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	5	And he said to them , Jehovah is witness against you , and his anointed is witness this day , that ye have not found aught in my hand ! And [ the people ] said , [ He is ] witness !
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	6	And Samuel said to the people , [ It is ] Jehovah who appointed Moses and Aaron , and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	7	And now stand still , that I may plead with you before Jehovah of all the righteous acts of Jehovah which he did to you and to your fathers .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	8	When Jacob had come into Egypt , and your fathers cried to Jehovah , then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron , and they brought your fathers forth out of Egypt , and made them dwell in this place .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	9	And they forgot Jehovah their God , and he sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the host of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab , and they fought against them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	10	And they cried to Jehovah and said , We have sinned , because we have forsaken Jehovah , and have served the Baals and the Ashtoreths ; and now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies , and we will serve thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	11	And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel , and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies round about , so that ye dwelt in safety .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	13	And now behold , the king whom ye have chosen , whom ye have asked for ! and behold , Jehovah has set a king over you .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	14	If ye fear Jehovah , and serve him , and hearken to his voice , and rebel not against the commandment of Jehovah , then both ye and the king also that reigns over you shall continue following Jehovah your God .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	15	But if ye will not hearken to the voice of Jehovah , and if ye rebel against the commandment of Jehovah , then will the hand of Jehovah be against you , as against your fathers .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	16	Now therefore stand and see this great thing which Jehovah will do before your eyes .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	17	Is it not wheat-harvest to-day ? I will call unto Jehovah , and he will send thunder and rain ; and ye shall perceive and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of Jehovah in asking for yourselves a king .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	18	And Samuel called to Jehovah ; and Jehovah sent thunder and rain that day . And all the people greatly feared Jehovah and Samuel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	19	And all the people said to Samuel , Pray to Jehovah thy God for thy servants , that we die not ; for we have added to all our sins the wickedness to ask for ourselves a king .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	20	And Samuel said to the people , Fear not : * ye * have done all this wickedness ; yet turn not aside from following Jehovah , and serve Jehovah with all your heart ;
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	21	and turn ye not aside ; for [ it would be ] after vain things which can not profit nor deliver ; for they are vain .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	22	For Jehovah will not cast away his people for his great name 's sake ; because it has pleased Jehovah to make you his people .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	23	Moreover , as for me , far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you ; and I will teach you the good and right way .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	24	Only , fear Jehovah , and serve him in truth , with all your heart ; for see how great things he has done for you .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	12	25	But if ye do wickedly , ye shall perish , both ye and your king .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	13	And Samuel said to Saul , Thou hast done foolishly : thou hast not kept the commandment of Jehovah thy God which he commanded thee ; for now would Jehovah have established thy kingdom over Israel for ever .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	2	And Saul chose him three thousand men out of Israel : there were with Saul two thousand in Michmash and in mount Bethel , and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin ; and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	3	And Jonathan smote the outpost of the Philistines that was in Geba , and the Philistines heard [ of it ] . And Saul blew the trumpet throughout the land , saying , Let the Hebrews hear .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	4	And all Israel heard say , Saul has smitten the garrison of the Philistines , and Israel also has become odious to the Philistines . And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	5	And the Philistines were assembled together to fight with Israel , thirty thousand chariots , and six thousand horsemen , and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude ; and they came up , and encamped in Michmash , eastward from Beth-Aven .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	6	And the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait ( for the people were distressed ) ; and the people hid themselves in caves , and in thickets , and in cliffs , and in strongholds , and in pits .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	7	And the Hebrews went over the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead . And Saul was yet in Gilgal , and all the people followed him trembling .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	8	And he waited seven days , according to the set time that Samuel [ had appointed ] ; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal ; and the people were scattered from him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	9	And Saul said , Bring hither to me the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings . And he offered up the burnt-offering .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	10	And it came to pass , as soon as he had ended offering up the burnt-offering , behold , Samuel came ; and Saul went out to meet him , that he might salute him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	11	And Samuel said , What hast thou done ? And Saul said , Because I saw that the people were scattered from me , and that thou didst not come within the days appointed , and that the Philistines were assembled at Michmash ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	12	I said , The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal , and I have not made supplication to Jehovah ; and I forced myself , and offered up the burnt-offering .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	14	But now thy kingdom shall not continue : Jehovah has sought him a man after his own heart , and Jehovah has appointed him ruler over his people ; for thou hast not kept what Jehovah commanded thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	15	And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin . And Saul numbered the people that were found with him , about six hundred men .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	16	And Saul , and Jonathan his son , and the people that were found with them , abode in Geba of Benjamin ; and the Philistines encamped in Michmash .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	17	And the ravagers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies : one company turned the way of Ophrah , into the land of Shual ;
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	18	and another company turned the way to Beth-horon ; and the other company turned the way to the district that looks over the ravine of Zeboim toward the wilderness .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	19	Now there was no smith found throughout the land of Israel ; for the Philistines said , Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	20	And all Israel went down to the Philistines , every man to get his ploughshare , and his hoe , and his axe , and his sickle sharpened ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	21	when the edges of the sickles , and the hoes , and the forks , and the axes were blunted ; and to set the goads .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	22	And it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan ; but with Saul and with Jonathan his son there was found .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	13	23	And a garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	14	And that first slaughter which Jonathan and his armour-bearer wrought was about twenty men , as it were on the half-furrow of an acre of land .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	2	And Saul abode at the extreme end of Gibeah under the pomegranate-tree which [ was ] in Migron ; and the people that were with him were about six hundred men .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	3	( And Ahijah the son of Ahitub , Ichabod 's brother , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eli , Jehovah 's priest in Shiloh , wore the ephod . ) And the people did not know that Jonathan was gone .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	4	Now between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines ' garrison there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side ; and the name of the one [ was ] Bozez , and the name of the other Seneh .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	5	The one crag [ formed ] a pillar on the north opposite to Michmash , and the other on the south opposite to Geba .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	6	And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour , Come , and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised : perhaps Jehovah will work for us ; for there is no restraint to Jehovah to save by many or by few .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	7	And his armour-bearer said to him , Do all that is in thy heart ; turn thee ; behold , I am with thee according to thy heart .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	8	Then said Jonathan , Behold , we will pass over to the men , and we will shew ourselves to them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	9	If they say thus to us , Stand still until we come to you , then we will stay in our place , and will not go up to them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	10	And if they say thus , Come up to us , then we will go up ; for Jehovah has given them into our hand ; and this shall be the sign to us .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	11	And both of them shewed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines ; and the Philistines said , Behold , the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	12	And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armour-bearer and said , Come up to us , and we will shew you something . And Jonathan said to his armour-bearer , Come up after me ; for Jehovah has delivered them into the hand of Israel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	13	And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet , and his armour-bearer after him ; and they fell before Jonathan ; and his armour-bearer slew after him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	15	And there was trembling in the camp , in the field , and among all the people ; the garrison , and the ravagers , they also trembled , and the earth quaked ; for it was a trembling [ from ] God .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	16	And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked , and behold , the multitude melted away , and they went on slaying one another .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	17	Then said Saul to the people that were with him , Muster now , and see who is gone from us . And they mustered , and behold , Jonathan and his armour-bearer were not there .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	18	And Saul said to Ahijah , Bring hither the ark of God . For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	19	And it came to pass while Saul talked to the priest , that the noise which was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased ; and Saul said to the priest , Withdraw thy hand .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	20	And Saul and all the people that were with him were called together , and they came to the battle ; and behold , every man 's sword was against his fellow , a very great confusion .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	21	And there were Hebrews with the Philistines before that time , who had gone up with them into the camp round about ; and they also [ turned ] to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	22	And all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in mount Ephraim heard that the Philistines fled , and they also followed hard after them in the battle .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	23	And Jehovah saved Israel that day ; and the battle passed over beyond Beth-Aven .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	24	But the men of Israel were distressed that day . Now Saul had adjured the people , saying , Cursed be the man that eateth food until evening , and [ until ] I am avenged on mine enemies . So none of the people tasted food .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	25	And all they of the land came to a wood ; and there was honey on the ground .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	26	And the people had come into the wood , and behold , the honey flowed ; but no man put his hand to his mouth , for the people feared the oath .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	27	But Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people ; and he put forth the end of his staff which was in his hand , and dipped it in the honeycomb , and put his hand to his mouth , and his eyes became bright .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	28	Then answered one of the people and said , Thy father strictly adjured the people , saying , Cursed be the man that eateth food this day ; and the people are faint .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	29	And Jonathan said , My father has troubled the land : see , I pray you , that mine eyes are bright , because I tasted a little of this honey .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	30	How much more , if the people had eaten freely to-day of the spoil of their enemies which they found ? for would there not now have been a much greater slaughter among the Philistines ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	31	And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Ajalon ; and the people were very faint .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	32	And the people fell on the spoil , and took sheep , and oxen , and calves , and slaughtered them on the ground ; and the people ate [ them ] with the blood .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	33	And they told Saul , saying , Behold , the people sin against Jehovah , in that they eat with the blood . And he said , Ye have acted perversely : roll me now a great stone .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	34	And Saul said , Disperse yourselves among the people , and say to them , Bring near to me every man his ox , and every man his sheep , and slaughter them here , and eat ; and sin not against Jehovah in eating with the blood . And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night , and slaughtered [ them ] there .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	35	And Saul built an altar to Jehovah : this was the first altar he built to Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	36	And Saul said , Let us go down after the Philistines by night , and plunder them until the morning light , and let us not leave a man of them . And they said , Do whatsoever is good in thy sight . Then said the priest , Let us come near hither to God .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	37	And Saul inquired of God , Shall I go down after the Philistines ? wilt thou give them into the hand of Israel ? But he did not answer him that day .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	38	And Saul said , Draw ye near hither , all the heads of the people ; and know and see wherein this sin has been this day .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	39	For , [ as ] Jehovah liveth , who has saved Israel , though it be in Jonathan my son , he shall certainly die . And no one answered him among all the people .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	40	Then said he to all Israel , Be ye on one side , and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side . And the people said to Saul , Do what is good in thy sight .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	41	And Saul said to Jehovah the God of Israel , Give a perfect [ testimony ] ! And Jonathan and Saul were taken , and the people escaped .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	42	And Saul said , Cast [ lots ] between me and Jonathan my son . And Jonathan was taken .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	43	And Saul said to Jonathan , Tell me what thou hast done . And Jonathan told him and said , With the end of the staff which is in my hand I tasted a little honey , [ and ] behold , I must die !
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	44	And Saul said , God do so [ to me ] and more also ; thou shalt certainly die , Jonathan .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	45	And the people said to Saul , Shall Jonathan die , who has wrought this great salvation in Israel ? Far be it ! [ as ] Jehovah liveth , there shall not a hair of his head fall to the ground ; for he has wrought with God this day . So the people delivered Jonathan , that he died not .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	46	And Saul went up from following the Philistines ; and the Philistines went to their own place .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	47	And Saul took the kingdom over Israel , and fought against all his enemies round about , against Moab , and against the children of Ammon , and against Edom , and against the kings of Zobah , and against the Philistines ; and whithersoever he turned himself , he discomfited [ them ] .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	48	And he did valiantly , and smote the Amalekites , and delivered Israel out of the hands of their spoilers .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	49	And the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and Jishvi , and Malchi-shua . And the names of his two daughters : the name of the firstborn Merab , and the name of the younger Michal .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	50	And the name of Saul 's wife was Ahinoam , the daughter of Ahimaaz ; and the name of the captain of his host was Abner , the son of Ner , Saul 's uncle .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	51	And Kish the father of Saul , and Ner the father of Abner were sons of Abiel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	14	52	And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul ; and when Saul saw any mighty man , or any valiant man , he took him to himself .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	15	And Saul said , They have brought them from the Amalekites , because the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen , to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God ; and the rest we have utterly destroyed .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	2	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : I have considered what Amalek did to Israel , how he set himself against him in the way , when he came up from Egypt .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	3	Now go and smite Amalek , and destroy utterly all that they have , and spare them not , but slay both man and woman , infant and suckling , ox and sheep , camel and ass .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	4	And Saul summoned the people , and numbered them in Telaim , two hundred thousand footmen , and ten thousand men of Judah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	5	And Saul came to the city of the Amalekites , and set an ambush in the valley .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	6	And Saul said to the Kenites , Go , depart , and go down from among the Amalekites , lest I destroy you with them ; for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt . And the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	7	And Saul smote Amalek from Havilah as thou comest to Shur , which is opposite to Egypt .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	8	And he took Agag the king of Amalek alive , and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	9	And Saul and the people spared Agag , and the best of the sheep and oxen , and beasts of the second bearing , and the lambs , and all that was good , and would not devote them to destruction ; but everything that was mean and weak , that they destroyed utterly .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	10	And the word of Jehovah came to Samuel , saying ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	11	It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king ; for he is turned away from following me , and hath not fulfilled my words . And Samuel was much grieved ; and he cried to Jehovah all night .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	12	And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning . And it was told Samuel , saying , Saul came to Carmel , and behold , he set him up a monument , and has turned about , and passed on , and gone down to Gilgal .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	13	And Samuel came to Saul ; and Saul said to him , Blessed art thou of Jehovah : I have fulfilled the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	14	And Samuel said , What [ means ] then this bleating of sheep in mine ears , and the lowing of oxen which I hear ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	16	And Samuel said to Saul , Stay , that I may tell thee what Jehovah has said to me this night . And he said to him , Say on .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	17	And Samuel said , Was it not when thou wast little in thine eyes that thou [ becamest ] the head of the tribes of Israel , and Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	18	And Jehovah sent thee on a way and said , Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites , and fight against them until they be consumed .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	19	Why then didst thou not hearken to the voice of Jehovah , but didst fall upon the spoil , and didst evil in the sight of Jehovah ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	20	And Saul said to Samuel , I have indeed hearkened to the voice of Jehovah , and have gone the way which Jehovah sent me , and have brought Agag the king of Amalek , and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	21	But the people took of the spoil , sheep and oxen , the choicest of the devoted things , to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God in Gilgal .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	22	And Samuel said , Has Jehovah delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices , As in hearkening to the voice of Jehovah ? Behold , obedience is better than sacrifice , Attention than the fat of rams .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	23	For rebellion is [ as ] the sin of divination , And selfwill is [ as ] iniquity and idolatry . Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah , He hath also rejected thee from being king .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	24	And Saul said to Samuel , I have sinned , for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah , and thy words ; for I feared the people , and hearkened to their voice .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	25	And now , I pray thee , forgive my sin , and turn again with me , that I may worship Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	26	And Samuel said to Saul , I will not turn again with thee ; for thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah , and Jehovah has rejected thee from being king over Israel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	27	And as Samuel turned to go away , [ Saul ] laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle , and it rent .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	28	Then Samuel said to him , Jehovah has rent the kingdom of Israel from thee to-day , and has given it to thy neighbour , who is better than thou .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	29	And also the Hope of Israel will not lie nor repent ; for he is not a man , that he should repent .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	30	And he said , I have sinned ; honour me now , I pray thee , before the elders of my people , and before Israel , and turn again with me , that I may worship Jehovah thy God .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	31	So Samuel turned again after Saul ; and Saul worshipped Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	32	And Samuel said , Bring ye near to me Agag the king of Amalek . And Agag came to him gaily . And Agag said , Surely the bitterness of death is past .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	33	And Samuel said , As thy sword has made women childless , so shall thy mother be childless above women . And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	34	And Samuel went to Ramah ; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	15	35	And Samuel saw Saul no more until the day of his death ; for Samuel mourned over Saul ; and Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	16	Let our lord now speak ; thy servants are before thee : they shall seek out a man , a skilful player on a harp ; and it shall come to pass , when the evil spirit from God is upon thee , that he shall play with his hand , and thou shalt be well .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	2	And Samuel said , How shall I go ? if Saul hear [ it ] , he will kill me . And Jehovah said , Take a heifer with thee , and say , I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	3	And call Jesse to the sacrifice , and I will tell thee what thou shalt do ; and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	4	And Samuel did what Jehovah said , and came to Bethlehem . And the elders of the city came trembling to meet him , and said , Dost thou come peaceably ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	5	And he said , Peaceably : I am come to sacrifice to Jehovah . Hallow yourselves , and come with me to the sacrifice . And he hallowed Jesse and his sons , and called them to the sacrifice .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	6	And it came to pass when they were come , that he looked on Eliab , and said , Surely Jehovah 's anointed is before him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	7	But Jehovah said to Samuel , Look not on his countenance , or on the height of his stature ; because I have rejected him ; for it is not as man seeth ; for man looketh upon the outward appearance , but Jehovah looketh upon the heart .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	8	Then Jesse called Abinadab , and made him pass before Samuel . And he said , Neither has Jehovah chosen this one .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	9	Then Jesse made Shammah pass by . And he said , Neither has Jehovah chosen this one .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	10	And Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel . And Samuel said to Jesse , Jehovah has not chosen these .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	11	And Samuel said to Jesse , Are these all the young men ? And he said , There is yet the youngest remaining , and behold , he is feeding the sheep . And Samuel said to Jesse , Send and fetch him ; for we will not sit at table till he come hither .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	12	And he sent and brought him in . And he was ruddy , and besides of a lovely countenance and beautiful appearance . And Jehovah said , Arise , anoint him ; for this is he .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	13	And Samuel took the horn of oil , and anointed him in the midst of his brethren . And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon David from that day forward . And Samuel rose up , and went to Ramah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	14	And the Spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul , and an evil spirit from Jehovah troubled him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	15	And Saul 's servants said to him , Behold now , an evil spirit from God troubles thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	17	And Saul said to his servants , Provide me now a man that can play well , and bring him to me .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	18	And one of the young men answered and said , Behold , I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite , who is skilled in playing , and he is a valiant man and a man of war , and skilled in speech , and of good presence , and Jehovah is with him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	19	Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said , Send me David thy son , who is with the sheep .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	20	And Jesse took an ass with bread , and a flask of wine , and a kid , and sent [ them ] by David his son to Saul .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	21	And David came to Saul , and stood before him ; and he loved him greatly ; and he became his armour-bearer .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	22	And Saul sent to Jesse , saying , Let David , I pray thee , stand before me ; for he has found favour in my sight .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	16	23	And it came to pass , when the [ evil ] spirit from God was upon Saul , that David took the harp , and played with his hand ; and Saul was refreshed , and was well , and the evil spirit departed from him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	17	And Jesse said to David his son , Take , I pray , for thy brethren , this ephah of parched [ corn ] and these ten loaves , and carry them quickly to the camp to thy brethren ;
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	2	And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together , and encamped in the valley of terebinths , and set the battle in array against the Philistines .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	3	And the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side ; and the ravine was between them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	4	And there went out a champion from the camp of the Philistines , named Goliath , of Gath , whose height was six cubits and a span .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	5	And he had a helmet of bronze upon his head , and he was clothed with a corselet of scales ; and the weight of the corselet was five thousand shekels of bronze .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	6	And he had greaves of bronze upon his legs , and a javelin of bronze between his shoulders .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	7	And the shaft of his spear was like a weaver 's beam ; and his spear 's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron ; and the shield-bearer went before him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	8	And he stood and cried to the ranks of Israel , and said to them , Why are ye come out to set your battle in array ? am not I the Philistine , and ye servants of Saul ? choose for yourselves a man , and let him come down to me .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	9	If he be able to fight with me , and to smite me , then will we be your servants ; but if I overcome and smite him , then shall ye be our servants and serve us .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	10	And the Philistine said , I have defied the ranks of Israel this day ; give me a man , that we may fight together .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	11	And Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine , and they were dismayed and greatly afraid .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	12	Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem-Judah whose name was Jesse ; and he had eight sons ; and the man was old in the days of Saul , advanced [ in years ] among men .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	13	And the three eldest of the sons of Jesse had gone and followed Saul to the battle ; and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn , and the second to him Abinadab , and the third Shammah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	14	And David was the youngest ; and the three eldest had followed Saul .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	15	But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father 's sheep at Bethlehem .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	16	And the Philistine drew near morning and evening , and presented himself forty days .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	18	and carry these ten cheeses to the captain of the thousand , and visit thy brethren to see how they are , and take a pledge of them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	19	Now Saul , and they , and all the men of Israel [ were ] in the valley of terebinths , fighting against the Philistines .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	20	And David rose up early in the morning , and left the sheep with a keeper , and took his charge and went , as Jesse had commanded him . And he came to the wagon-defence ; and the host which was going forth to the battle-array shouted for the fight .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	21	And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array , rank against rank .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	22	And David left the things he was carrying in the hand of the keeper of the baggage , and ran into the ranks , and came and saluted his brethren .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	23	And as he talked with them , behold there came up the champion , the Philistine of Gath , Goliath by name , out of the ranks of the Philistines , and spoke according to the same words ; and David heard [ them ] .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	24	And all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him and were greatly afraid .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	25	And the men of Israel said , Have ye seen this man that comes up ? for to defy Israel is he come up : and it shall be , that the man who smites him , him will the king enrich with great riches , and will give him his daughter , and make his father 's house free in Israel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	26	And David spoke to the men that stood by him , saying , What shall be done to the man that smites this Philistine , and takes away the reproach from Israel ? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine , that he should defy the armies of the living God ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	27	And the people told him after this manner , saying , So shall it be done to the man that smites him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	28	And Eliab , his eldest brother , heard while he spoke to the men ; and Eliab 's anger was kindled against David , and he said , Why art thou come down ? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness ? I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thy heart ; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	29	And David said , What have I now done ? Was it not laid upon me ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	30	And he turned from him to another , and spoke after the same manner ; and the people answered him again after the former manner .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	31	And the words were heard which David spoke , and they rehearsed them before Saul ; and he sent for him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	32	And David said to Saul , Let no man 's heart fail because of him : thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	33	And Saul said to David , Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him ; for thou art but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	34	And David said to Saul , Thy servant fed his father 's sheep , and there came a lion , and also a bear , and took a lamb out of the flock .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	35	And I went after him , and smote him , and delivered it out of his mouth ; and when he arose against me , I seized him by his beard , and smote him , and slew him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	36	Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear ; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them , because he has defied the armies of the living God .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	37	And David said , Jehovah who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine . And Saul said to David , Go , and Jehovah be with thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	38	And Saul clothed David with his dress , and put a helmet of bronze upon his head , and clothed him with a corselet .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	39	And David girded his sword upon his dress , and endeavoured to go ; for he had not yet tried [ it ] . And David said to Saul , I can not go in these ; for I have never tried [ them ] . And David put them off him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	40	And he took his staff in his hand , and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook , and put them in the shepherd 's bag that he had , into the pocket ; and his sling was in his hand . And he drew near to the Philistine .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	41	And the Philistine came on and approached David ; and the man that bore the shield was before him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	42	And when the Philistine looked about and saw David , he disdained him ; for he was a youth , and ruddy , and besides of a beautiful countenance .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	43	And the Philistine said to David , Am I a dog , that thou comest to me with staves ? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	44	And the Philistine said to David , Come to me , and I will give thy flesh to the fowls of the heavens and to the beasts of the field .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	45	And David said to the Philistine , Thou comest to me with sword , and with spear , and with javelin ; but I come to thee in the name of Jehovah of hosts , the God of the armies of Israel , whom thou hast defied .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	46	This day will Jehovah deliver thee up into my hand ; and I will smite thee , and take thy head from thee ; and I will give the carcases of the camp of the Philistines this day to the fowl of the heavens and to the wild beasts of the earth . And all the earth shall know that Israel has a God ;
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	47	and all this congregation shall know that Jehovah saves not with sword and spear ; for the battle is Jehovah 's , and he will give you into our hands .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	48	And it came to pass , when the Philistine arose , and came and advanced to meet David , that David hasted , and ran towards the ranks to meet the Philistine .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	49	And David put his hand into the bag , and took thence a stone , and slang it , and smote the Philistine in his forehead , and the stone sank into his forehead ; and he fell on his face to the earth .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	50	So David overcame the Philistine with a sling and a stone , and smote the Philistine and killed him ; and there was no sword in the hand of David .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	51	And David ran , and stood upon the Philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of its sheath , and killed him completely , and cut off his head with it . And when the Philistines saw that their hero was dead , they fled .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	52	And the men of Israel and of Judah arose , and shouted , and pursued the Philistines , until thou comest to the ravine and to the gates of Ekron . And the wounded of the Philistines fell down on the way to Shaaraim , even to Gath , and to Ekron .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	53	And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines , and they pillaged their camps .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	54	And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem ; but he put his armour in his tent .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	55	And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine , he said to Abner , the captain of the host , Abner , whose son is this young man ? And Abner said , As thy soul liveth , O king , I can not tell .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	56	And the king said , Inquire thou whose son this youth is .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	57	And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine , Abner took him , and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	17	58	And Saul said to him , Whose son art thou , young man ? And David said , I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	18	And David said to Saul , Who am I ? and what is my life , [ or ] my father 's family in Israel , that I should be son-in-law to the king ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	2	And Saul took him that day , and would not let him return to his father 's house .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	3	And Jonathan and David made a covenant , because he loved him as his own soul .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	4	And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him , and gave it to David , and his dress , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his girdle .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	5	And David went forth ; whithersoever Saul sent him he prospered ; and Saul set him over the men of war , and he was accepted in the sight of all the people , and also in the sight of Saul 's servants .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	6	And it came to pass as they came , when David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine , that the women came out of all the cities of Israel , singing and dancing , to meet king Saul , with tambours , with joy , and with triangles .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	7	And the women answered [ one another ] as they played , and said , Saul hath smitten his thousands , And David his ten thousands .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	8	And Saul was very wroth , and that saying was evil in his sight ; and he said , They have ascribed to David ten thousands , but to me they have ascribed the thousands ; and [ what ] is there more for him but the kingdom ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	9	And Saul eyed David from that day and forward .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	10	And it came to pass the next day that an evil spirit from God came upon Saul , and he prophesied in the midst of the house , but David played with his hand , as on other days ; and the spear was in Saul 's hand .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	11	And Saul cast the spear , and thought , I will smite David and the wall . But David turned away from him twice .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	12	And Saul was afraid of David , because Jehovah was with him , and had departed from Saul .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	13	And Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	14	And David prospered in all his ways ; and Jehovah was with him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	15	And Saul saw that he prospered well , and he stood in awe of him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	16	But all Israel and Judah loved David , for he went out and came in before them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	17	And Saul said to David , Behold my eldest daughter Merab , her will I give thee to wife ; only be thou valiant for me , and fight Jehovah 's battles . But Saul thought , My hand shall not be upon him , but the hand of the Philistines shall be upon him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	19	And it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul 's daughter should have been given to David , that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	20	And Michal Saul 's daughter loved David ; and they told Saul , and the thing was right in his sight .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	21	And Saul said , I will give him her , that she may be a snare to him , and that the hand of the Philistines may be upon him . And Saul said to David , Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law a second time .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	22	And Saul commanded his servants , Speak with David secretly , saying , Behold , the king has delight in thee , and all his servants love thee : now therefore be the king 's son-in-law .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	23	And Saul 's servants spoke those words in the ears of David . And David said , Is it a light thing in your eyes to be the king 's son-in-law , seeing that I am a poor man , and lightly esteemed ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	24	And the servants of Saul told him , saying , On this manner did David speak .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	25	And Saul said , Thus shall ye say to David : The king does not desire any dowry , but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines , to be avenged of the king 's enemies . But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	26	And his servants told David these words ; and the thing was right in David 's sight to be the king 's son-in-law . And the days were not expired ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	27	when David arose and went , he and his men , and smote of the Philistines two hundred men ; and David brought their foreskins , and they delivered them in full to the king , that he might be the king 's son-in-law . And Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	28	And Saul saw and knew that Jehovah was with David ; and Michal Saul 's daughter loved him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	29	And Saul was yet the more afraid of David ; and Saul was David 's enemy continually .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	18	30	And the princes of the Philistines went forth ; and it came to pass , whenever they went forth , that David succeeded better than all the servants of Saul ; and his name was much esteemed .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	19	And it was told Saul , saying , Behold , David is at Naioth by Ramah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	2	But Jonathan Saul 's son delighted much in David . And Jonathan told David , saying , Saul my father seeks to kill thee ; and now , I pray thee , take heed to thyself in the morning , and abide in a secret place and hide thyself ;
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	3	and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art , and will speak of thee with my father : and see what it is , and tell thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	4	And Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father , and said to him , Let not the king sin against his servant , against David , because he has not sinned against thee ; for also what he did was very advantageous to thee ;
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	5	for he put his life in hand , and smote the Philistine , and Jehovah wrought a great salvation for all Israel : thou didst see [ it ] , and didst rejoice ; why then wilt thou sin against innocent blood , in slaying David without cause ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	6	And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan , and Saul swore , [ As ] Jehovah liveth , he shall not be put to death !
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	7	Then Jonathan called David , and Jonathan declared to him all those things . And Jonathan brought David to Saul , and he was in his presence as previously .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	8	And there was war again ; and David went forth and fought with the Philistines , and smote them with a great slaughter ; and they fled before him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	9	And an evil spirit from Jehovah was upon Saul . And he sat in his house with his spear in his hand ; and David played with his hand .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	10	And Saul sought to smite David and the wall with the spear ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he smote the spear into the wall . And David fled , and escaped that night .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	11	And Saul sent messengers to David 's house , to watch him , and to slay him in the morning ; and Michal David 's wife told him , saying , If thou save not thy life to-night , to-morrow thou wilt be put to death .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	12	And Michal let David down through a window ; and he went , and fled and escaped .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	13	And Michal took the image , and laid it in the bed , and put the net of goats ' [ hair ] at its head , and covered it with the coverlet .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	14	And Saul sent messengers to take David , and she said , He is sick .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	15	And Saul sent the messengers to see David , saying , Bring him up to me in the bed , that I may put him to death .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	16	And the messengers came in , and behold , the image was in the bed , and the net of goats ' [ hair ] at its head .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	17	Then Saul said to Michal , Why hast thou deceived me so , and sent away mine enemy , that he is escaped ? And Michal said to Saul , He said to me , Let me go ; why should I slay thee ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	18	And David fled , and escaped , and came to Samuel to Ramah , and told him all that Saul had done to him . And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	20	Then Saul sent messengers to take David ; and they saw a company of prophets prophesying , and Samuel standing as president over them ; and the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul , and they also prophesied .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	21	And it was told Saul , and he sent other messengers , and they also prophesied . And Saul sent messengers again the third time , and they also prophesied .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	22	Then went he also to Ramah , and came to the great well that is in Sechu ; and he asked and said , Where are Samuel and David ? And one said , Behold , at Naioth by Ramah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	23	And he went thither to Naioth by Ramah ; and the Spirit of God came upon him also , and he went on , and prophesied , until he came to Naioth by Ramah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	19	24	And he himself also stripped off his clothes , and prophesied , himself also , before Samuel , and lay down naked all that day and all that night . Wherefore they say , Is Saul also among the prophets ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	20	And I will shoot three arrows on the side of it , as though I shot at a mark .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	2	And he said to him , God forbid ; thou shalt not die : behold , my father will do nothing either great or small , and not apprise me ; and why should my father hide this thing from me ? it is not so .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	3	And David swore again and again , and said , Thy father certainly knows that I have found favour in thy sight : and he has thought , Jonathan shall not know this , lest he be grieved ; but truly [ as ] Jehovah liveth , and [ as ] thy soul liveth , there is but a step between me and death .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	4	And Jonathan said to David , What thy soul may say , I will even do it for thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	5	And David said to Jonathan , Behold , to-morrow is new moon , and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat ; but let me go , that I may hide myself in the field until the third evening .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	6	If thy father should actually miss me , then say , David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city ; for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	7	If he say thus , It is well , —thy servant shall have peace ; but if he be very wroth , be sure that evil is determined by him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	8	Deal kindly then with thy servant ; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of Jehovah with thee ; but if there be in me iniquity , slay me thyself ; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	9	And Jonathan said , Far be it from thee ; for , if I knew with certainty that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee , would I not tell it thee ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	10	Then said David to Jonathan , Who shall tell me ? or what if thy father answer thee roughly ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	11	And Jonathan said to David , Come and let us go out into the field . And they went out both of them into the field .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	12	And Jonathan said to David , Jehovah , God of Israel , when I sound my father about this time to-morrow , [ or ] the next day , and behold , there be good toward David , and I then send not to thee , and apprise thee of it ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	13	Jehovah do so and much more to Jonathan . Should it please my father [ to do ] thee evil , then I will apprise thee of it , and send thee away , that thou mayest go in peace ; and Jehovah be with thee , as he has been with my father .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	14	And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of Jehovah , that I die not ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	15	but thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever , no , not when Jehovah cuts off the enemies of David , every one from the face of the earth .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	16	And Jonathan made [ a covenant ] with the house of David , [ saying , ] Let Jehovah even require [ it ] at the hand of David 's enemies !
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	17	And Jonathan caused David to swear again , by the love he had for him , for he loved him as he loved his own soul .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	18	And Jonathan said to him , To-morrow is the new moon ; and thou wilt be missed , for thy seat will be empty ;
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	19	but on the third day thou shalt go down quickly , and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself on the day of the business , and abide by the stone Ezel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	21	And behold , I will send the lad , [ saying , ] Go , find the arrows . If I expressly say to the lad , Behold , the arrows are on this side of thee , take them ; then come , for there is peace for thee , and it is nothing ; [ as ] Jehovah liveth .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	22	But if I say thus to the youth : Behold , the arrows are beyond thee , —go thy way ; for Jehovah sends thee away .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	23	And as to the matter which thou and I have spoken of , behold , Jehovah is between me and thee for ever .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	24	And David hid himself in the field ; and it was the new moon , and the king sat at table to eat .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	25	And the king sat on his seat , as at other times , on the seat by the wall ; and Jonathan arose , and Abner sat by Saul 's side , and David 's place was empty .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	26	And Saul said nothing that day ; for he thought , Something has befallen [ him ] , that he is not clean : surely he is not clean .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	27	And it came to pass the next day after the new moon , the second [ day of the month ] , as David 's place was empty , that Saul said to Jonathan his son , Why has not the son of Jesse come to table , neither yesterday nor to-day ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	28	And Jonathan answered Saul , David earnestly asked leave of me [ to go ] to Bethlehem ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	29	and said , Let me go , I pray thee ; for we have a family sacrifice in the city ; and my brother himself has commanded me [ to be there ] ; and now , if I have found favour in thy sight , let me go away , I pray thee , and see my brethren . He has therefore not come to the king 's table .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	30	And Saul 's anger was kindled against Jonathan , and he said to him , Son of the perverse rebellious woman , do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame and to the shame of thy mother 's nakedness ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	31	For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon earth , thou shalt not be established , nor thy kingdom . And now send and fetch him to me , for he must die .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	32	And Jonathan answered Saul his father , and said to him , Why should he be put to death ? what has he done ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	33	Then Saul cast the spear at him to smite him ; and Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to put David to death .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	34	And Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and ate no meat the second day of the new moon ; for he was grieved for David , because his father had done him shame .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	35	And it came to pass in the morning that Jonathan went out into the field , to the place agreed on with David , and a little lad with him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	36	And he said to his lad , Run , find now the arrows which I shoot . The lad ran , and he shot the arrow beyond him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	37	And when the lad came to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the lad and said , Is not the arrow away beyond thee ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	38	And Jonathan cried after the lad , Make speed , haste , stay not ! And Jonathan 's lad gathered up the arrows , and came to his master .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	39	And the lad knew nothing : only Jonathan and David knew the matter .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	40	And Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad , and said to him , Go , carry them to the city .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	41	The lad went , and David arose from the side of the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times ; and they kissed one another , and wept one with another , until David exceeded .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	20	42	And Jonathan said to David , Go in peace , forasmuch as we have both of us sworn in the name of Jehovah , saying , Jehovah be between me and thee , and between my seed and thy seed for ever ! And he arose and departed ; and Jonathan went into the city .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	21	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	21	21	And David came to Nob , to Ahimelech the priest ; and Ahimelech trembled at meeting David , and said to him , Why art thou alone , and no man with thee ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	21	2	And David said to Ahimelech the priest , The king has commanded me a business , and has said to me , Let no man know anything of the business whereon I send thee , and what I have commanded thee ; and I have directed the young men to such and such a place .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	21	3	And now what is under thy hand ? give me five loaves in my hand , or what may be found .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	21	4	And the priest answered David and said , There is no common bread under my hand , but there is holy bread ; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	21	5	And David answered the priest and said to him , Yes indeed , women have been kept from us about these three days , since I came out , and the vessels of the young men are holy , and the [ bread ] is in a manner common , and the more so , because to-day [ new ] is hallowed in the vessels .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	21	6	And the priest gave him holy [ bread ] ; for there was no bread there but the shew-loaves that were taken from before Jehovah , to put on hot bread in the day when they were taken away .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	21	7	( Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day , detained before Jehovah ; and his name was Doeg , the Edomite , chief of the shepherds that [ belonged ] to Saul . )
DARBY	1%20Samuel	21	8	And David said to Ahimelech , And is there not here under thy hand spear or sword ? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me , for the king 's business was urgent .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	21	9	And the priest said , The sword of Goliath the Philistine , whom thou slewest in the valley of terebinths , behold , it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod ; if thou wilt take that , take it ; for there is no other save that here . And David said , There is none like that : give it me .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	21	10	And David arose , and fled that day from before Saul , and went to Achish the king of Gath .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	21	11	And the servants of Achish said to him , Is not this David the king of the land ? did they not sing one to another of him in dances , saying , Saul has smitten his thousands , and David his ten thousands ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	21	12	And David took to heart these words , and was much afraid of Achish the king of Gath .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	21	13	And he changed his behaviour before them , and feigned himself mad in their hands , and scratched on the doors of the gate , and let his spittle fall down on his beard .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	21	14	And Achish said to his servants , Behold , ye see the man is mad : why did ye bring him to me ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	21	15	have I lack of madmen , that ye have brought this one to rave in my presence ? shall this [ man ] come into my house ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	22	And David said to Abiathar , I knew it that day , when Doeg the Edomite was there , that he would certainly tell Saul : I am accountable for all the lives of thy father 's house .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	2	And every one in distress , and every one that was in debt , and every one of embittered spirit collected round him ; and he became a captain over them ; and there were with him about four hundred men .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	3	And David went thence to Mizpeh in Moab , and said to the king of Moab , Let my father and my mother , I pray thee , come forth amongst you , till I know what God will do for me .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	4	And he brought them before the king of Moab ; and they abode with him all the while that David was in the stronghold .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	5	And the prophet Gad said to David , Abide not in the stronghold ; depart , and go into the land of Judah . Then David departed , and came into the forest of Hareth .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	6	And Saul heard that David was discovered , and the men that were with him . Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah under the tamarisk upon the height , having his spear in his hand , and all his servants were standing by him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	7	Then Saul said to his servants that stood by him , Hear now , ye Benjaminites : will the son of Jesse give every one of you also fields and vineyards ? Will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	8	that all of you have conspired against me , and there is none that informs me when my son has made [ a covenant ] with the son of Jesse ; and there is none of you that is sorry for me , or informs me that my son has stirred up my servant as a lier-in-wait against me , as at this day ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	9	Then answered Doeg the Edomite , who was set over the servants of Saul , and said , I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob , to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	10	And he inquired of Jehovah for him , and gave him victuals , and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	11	Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest , the son of Ahitub , and all his father 's house , the priests that were in Nob ; and they came all of them to the king .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	12	And Saul said , Hear now , son of Ahitub . And he answered , Here I am , my lord .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	13	And Saul said to him , Why have ye conspired against me , thou and the son of Jesse , in that thou hast given him bread , and a sword , and hast inquired of God for him , that he should rise against me as a lier-in-wait , as at this day ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	14	And Ahimelech answered the king and said , And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David , who is the king 's son-in-law , and has access to thy secret council , and is honourable in thy house ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	15	Was it to-day that I began to inquire of God for him ? be it far from me : let not the king charge anything to his servant , [ nor ] to all the house of my father ; for thy servant knew nothing of all this , less or more .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	16	And the king said , Thou shalt certainly die , Ahimelech , thou , and all thy father 's house .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	17	And the king said to the couriers that stood about him , Turn and put the priests of Jehovah to death ; because their hand also is with David , and because they knew when he fled , and did not inform me . But the servants of the king were not willing to put forth their hand to fall on the priests of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	18	And the king said to Doeg , Turn thou , and fall on the priests . And Doeg the Edomite turned , and fell on the priests , and put to death that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	19	And Nob , the city of the priests , he smote with the edge of the sword , both men and women , infants and sucklings , and oxen , and asses , and sheep , with the edge of the sword .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	20	And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub , named Abiathar , escaped , and fled after David .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	21	And Abiathar informed David that Saul had slain Jehovah 's priests .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	22	23	Abide with me , fear not ; for he that seeks my life seeks thy life ; for with me thou art in safe keeping .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	23	And see , and ascertain all the lurking-places where he hides himself , and come ye again to me with sure information , that I may go with you ; and it shall come to pass , if he be in the land , that I will search him out throughout the thousands of Judah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	2	And David inquired of Jehovah , saying , Shall I go and smite these Philistines ? And Jehovah said to David , Go and smite the Philistines , and save Keilah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	3	But David 's men said to him , Behold , we are afraid here in Judah ; how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	4	And David inquired of Jehovah yet again . And Jehovah answered him and said , Arise , go down to Keilah ; for I will give the Philistines into thy hand .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	5	And David and his men went to Keilah , and fought against the Philistines , and brought away their cattle , and smote them with a great slaughter . So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	6	And it came to pass , when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah , he came down with an ephod in his hand .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	7	And it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah . Then Saul said , God has cast him off into my hand ; for he is shut in , by entering into a city that has gates and bars .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	8	And Saul summoned all the people to war , to go down to Keilah , to besiege David and his men .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	9	And when David knew that Saul devised mischief against him , he said to Abiathar the priest , Bring the ephod .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	10	Then said David , Jehovah , God of Israel , thy servant hath heard for certain that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah , to destroy the city for my sake .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	11	Will the citizens of Keilah deliver me up into his hand ? will Saul come down , as thy servant hath heard ? Jehovah , God of Israel , I beseech thee , tell thy servant . And Jehovah said , He will come down .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	12	And David said , Will the citizens of Keilah deliver up me and my men into the hand of Saul ? And Jehovah said , They will deliver [ thee ] up .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	13	Then David and his men , about six hundred , arose and departed out of Keilah , and went whithersoever they could go . And it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keilah , and he forbore to go forth .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	14	And David abode in the wilderness in strongholds , and abode in the mountain in the wilderness of Ziph . And Saul sought him every day , but God did not give him into his hand .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	15	And David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life ; and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	16	And Jonathan Saul 's son arose , and went to David into the wood , and strengthened his hand in God .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	17	And he said to him , Fear not ; for the hand of Saul my father will not find thee ; and thou shalt be king over Israel , and I shall be next to thee ; and that also Saul my father knows .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	18	And they two made a covenant before Jehovah ; and David abode in the wood , and Jonathan went to his house .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	19	And the Ziphites came up to Saul to Gibeah , saying , Does not David hide himself with us in strongholds in the wood , on the hill of Hachilah , which is on the south of the waste ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	20	And now , O king , come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down ; and it will be for us to deliver him up into the king 's hand .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	21	And Saul said , Blessed be ye of Jehovah ; for ye have compassion upon me .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	22	Go , I pray you , make yet more sure , and know and see his place where his track is , who has seen him there ; for it is told me that he deals very subtilly .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	24	And they arose and went to Ziph before Saul ; but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon , in the plain on the south of the waste .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	25	And Saul and his men went to seek [ him ] . And they told David ; and he came down from the rock , and abode in the wilderness of Maon . And Saul heard [ that ] , and he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	26	And Saul went on this side of the mountain , and David and his men on that side of the mountain ; and David made haste to get away from Saul ; and Saul and his men sought to surround David and his men to take them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	27	But there came a messenger to Saul , saying , Haste thee and come ; for the Philistines have made a raid against the land .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	28	And Saul returned from pursuing after David , and went against the Philistines ; therefore they called that place Sela-hammahlekoth .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	23	29	And David went up from thence , and abode in the strongholds of Engedi .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	24	And it came to pass when Saul had returned from following the Philistines , that it was told him , saying , Behold , David is in the wilderness of Engedi .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	2	And Saul took three thousand men , chosen out of all Israel , and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	3	And he came to the sheepfolds by the way , where was a cave ; and Saul went in to cover his feet ; and David and his men were abiding in the recesses of the cave .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	4	And David 's men said to him , Behold the day of which Jehovah said to thee , Behold , I will give thine enemy into thy hand , that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good to thee . And David arose , and cut off the skirt of Saul 's robe secretly .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	5	And it came to pass afterwards that David 's heart smote him , because he had cut off Saul 's skirt .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	6	And he said to his men , Jehovah forbid that I should do this thing to my master , Jehovah 's anointed , to stretch forth my hand against him , for he is the anointed of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	7	And David checked his men with these words , and suffered them not to rise against Saul . And Saul rose up out of the cave , and went on [ his ] way .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	8	David also arose afterwards , and went out of the cave , and cried after Saul , saying , My lord the king ! And when Saul looked behind him , David bowed with his face to the earth , and did obeisance .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	9	And David said to Saul , Why dost thou listen to words of men , saying , Behold , David seeks thy hurt ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	10	Behold , this day thine eyes have seen how that Jehovah had given thee this day into my hand in the cave ; and they bade me kill thee ; but [ mine eye ] spared thee ; and I said , I will not put forth my hand against my lord , for he is the anointed of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	11	And see , my father , yes , see the skirt of thy robe in my hand . For in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe , and killed thee not , know and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand , and I have not sinned against thee ; yet thou liest in wait for my life to take it .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	12	Jehovah judge between me and thee , and Jehovah avenge me of thee ; but my hand shall not be upon thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	13	As saith the proverb of the ancients , Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked ; but my hand shall not be upon thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	14	After whom is the king of Israel come out ? after whom dost thou pursue ? after a dead dog , after a single flea .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	15	Jehovah therefore shall be judge , and judge between me and thee , and see , and plead my cause , and do me justice [ in delivering me ] out of thy hand .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	16	And as soon as David had ended speaking these words to Saul , Saul said , Is this thy voice , my son David ? And Saul lifted up his voice and wept .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	17	And he said to David , Thou art more righteous than I ; for thou hast rewarded me good , whereas I have rewarded thee evil .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	18	And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me , forasmuch as when Jehovah had delivered me up into thy hand , thou didst not kill me .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	19	For if a man find his enemy , will he let him go well away ? wherefore Jehovah reward thee good for that thou hast done to me this day .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	20	And now behold , I know that thou shalt certainly be king , and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	21	Swear now therefore to me by Jehovah , that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	24	22	And David swore to Saul . And Saul went home ; and David and his men went up to the stronghold .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	25	Let not my lord , I pray thee , regard this man of Belial , Nabal ; for as his name is , so is he : Nabal is his name , and folly is with him ; and I thy handmaid did not see the young men of my lord , whom thou didst send .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	2	And there was a man at Maon , whose business was at Carmel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats ; and he was shearing his sheep at Carmel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	3	And the name of the man was Nabal , and the name of his wife Abigail ; and the woman was of good understanding , and of a beautiful countenance ; but the man was churlish and evil in his doings ; and he was a Calebite .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	4	And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	5	Then David sent out ten young men ; and David said to the young men , Go up to Carmel , and go to Nabal , and greet him in my name .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	6	And thus shall ye say : Long life [ to thee ] ! and peace be to thee , and peace be to thy house , and peace be to all that thou hast !
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	7	And now I have heard that thou hast shearers ; now thy shepherds who were with us , we hurt them not , neither was there aught missed by them , all the while they were in Carmel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	8	Ask thy young men , and they will tell thee . Therefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes ; for we come in a good day : give , I pray thee , what thy hand may find to thy servants , and to thy son David .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	9	And David 's young men came , and spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David , and ceased .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	10	And Nabal answered David 's servants and said , Who is David ? and who is the son of Jesse ? there are many servants now-a-days that break away every man from his master .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	11	And shall I take my bread , and my water , and my flesh which I have killed for my shearers , and give [ it ] to men whom I know not whence they are ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	12	And David 's young men turned their way , and went back , and came and reported to him according to all those words .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	13	And David said to his men , Gird ye on every man his sword . And they girded on every man his sword ; and David also girded on his sword ; and there went up after David about four hundred men ; and two hundred abode by the baggage .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	14	And one of [ Nabal 's ] young men told Abigail , Nabal 's wife , saying , Behold , David sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless our master ; and he has insulted them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	15	And the men were very good to us , and we were not hurt , neither missed we anything , as long as we companied with them , when we were in the fields .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	16	They were a wall to us both by night and day , all the while we were with them feeding the sheep .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	17	And now know and consider what thou wilt do , for evil is determined against our master , and against all his household ; and he is such a son of Belial , that one can not speak to him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	18	And Abigail made haste , and took two hundred loaves , and two skin-bottles of wine , and five sheep ready dressed , and five measures of parched [ corn ] , and a hundred raisin-cakes , and two hundred fig-cakes , and laid them on asses .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	19	And she said to her young men , Go on before me ; behold , I come after you . But she did not tell her husband Nabal .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	20	And as she was riding on the ass , and coming down by the covert of the hill , behold , David and his men came down opposite to her ; and she met them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	21	Now David had said , Surely , in vain have I kept all that this [ man ] had in the wilderness , so that nothing was missed of all that was his ; and he has requited me evil for good .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	22	So and more also do God to the enemies of David , if I leave of all that is his by the morning light any male .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	23	And when Abigail saw David , she hasted and lighted off the ass , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	24	and fell at his feet , and said , Upon me , my lord , [ upon ] me let the iniquity be ; but let thy handmaid , I pray thee , speak in thine ears , and hear the words of thy handmaid .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	26	And now , my lord , [ as ] Jehovah liveth , and [ as ] thy soul liveth , seeing Jehovah has restrained thee from coming with bloodshed , and from avenging thyself with thine own hand , now let thine enemies , and they that seek evil to my lord , be as Nabal .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	27	And now this blessing which thy bondmaid has brought to my lord , let it be given to the young men that follow my lord .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	28	I pray thee , forgive the transgression of thy handmaid : for Jehovah will certainly make my lord a lasting house ; because my lord fights the battles of Jehovah , and evil has not been found in thee all thy days .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	29	And if a man is risen up to pursue thee and to seek thy life , the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living with Jehovah thy God ; and the souls of thine enemies , them shall he sling out from the hollow of the sling .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	30	And it shall come to pass , when Jehovah shall do to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning thee , and shall appoint thee ruler over Israel ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	31	that this shall be no stumbling-block to thee , nor offence of heart for my lord , either that thou hast shed blood without cause , or that my lord has avenged himself . And when Jehovah shall deal well with my lord , then remember thy handmaid .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	32	And David said to Abigail , Blessed be Jehovah , the God of Israel , who sent thee this day to meet me .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	33	And blessed be thy discernment , and blessed be thou , who hast kept me this day from coming with bloodshed , and from avenging myself with mine own hand .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	34	But indeed , as Jehovah the God of Israel liveth , who has restrained me from hurting thee , except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me , there had not been left to Nabal by the morning light any male .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	35	So David received of her hand what she had brought him , and said to her , Go up in peace to thy house ; see , I have hearkened to thy voice , and have accepted thy person .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	36	And Abigail came to Nabal ; and behold , he held a feast in his house , like the feast of a king ; and Nabal 's heart was merry within him , for he was drunken to excess ; so she told him nothing , less or more , until the morning light .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	37	And it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , that his wife told him these things ; and his heart died within him , and he became [ as ] a stone .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	38	And it came to pass in about ten days that Jehovah smote Nabal , and he died .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	39	And when David heard that Nabal was dead , he said , Blessed be Jehovah , who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal , and has kept back his servant from evil ; but Jehovah has returned Nabal 's evil upon his own head . And David sent and communed with Abigail , to take her as his wife .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	40	And the servants of David came to Abigail to Carmel , and spoke to her , saying , David has sent us to thee , to take thee as his wife .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	41	And she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth , and said , Behold , let thy handmaid be a bondwoman to wash the feet of the servants of my lord .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	42	And Abigail hasted , and arose , and rode upon an ass , with five damsels of hers that followed her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	43	David had also taken Ahinoam of Jizreel ; and they became , even both of them , his wives .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	25	44	But Saul had given Michal his daughter , David 's wife , to Phalti the son of Laish , who was of Gallim .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	26	And the Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah , saying , Does not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah , facing the waste ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	2	And Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Ziph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	3	And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah , which faces the waste , by the way side . And David abode in the wilderness ; and when he saw that Saul had come after him into the wilderness ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	4	David sent out spies , and learned that Saul was certainly come .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	5	And David arose and came to the place where Saul had encamped ; and David beheld the place where Saul lay , and Abner the son of Ner , the captain of his host ; and Saul lay within the wagon-defence , and the people were encamped round about him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	6	And David spake and said to Ahimelech the Hittite , and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah , Joab 's brother , saying , Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp ? And Abishai said , I will go down with thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	7	And David and Abishai came to the people by night , and behold , Saul lay sleeping within the wagon-defence , and his spear stuck in the ground at his head ; and Abner and the people lay round about him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	8	And Abishai said to David , God has delivered thine enemy into thy hand this day ; and now let me smite him , I pray thee , with the spear , even to the ground once , and I will not do it the second time .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	9	And David said to Abishai , Destroy him not ; for who can stretch forth his hand against Jehovah 's anointed , and be guiltless ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	10	And David said , [ As ] Jehovah liveth , Jehovah will surely smite him ; either his day shall come to die , or he shall descend into battle and perish .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	11	Jehovah forbid that I should stretch forth my hand against Jehovah 's anointed ! But now take , I pray thee , the spear that is at his head , and the cruse of water , and let us go .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	12	And David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul 's head ; and they went away , and no man saw [ it ] , and none knew [ it ] , and none awaked , for they were all asleep ; for a deep sleep from Jehovah had fallen upon them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	13	And David went over to the other side , and stood on the top of a hill afar off ; a great space [ being ] between them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	14	And David cried to the people , and to Abner the son of Ner , saying , Answerest thou not , Abner ? Then Abner answered and said , Who art thou that criest to the king ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	15	And David said to Abner , Art not thou a man ? and who is like to thee in Israel ? and why hast thou not guarded thy lord the king ? for one of the people came in to destroy the king thy lord .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	16	This thing is not good which thou hast done . As Jehovah liveth , ye are worthy to die , because ye have not guarded your master , Jehovah 's anointed . And now see where the king 's spear is , and the cruse of water that was at his head .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	17	And Saul knew David 's voice , and said , Is this thy voice , my son David ? And David said , It is my voice , my lord , O king .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	18	And he said , Why does my lord thus pursue after his servant ? for what have I done ? or what evil is in my hand ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	19	And now , I pray thee , let my lord the king hear the words of his servant . If Jehovah have moved thee against me , let him accept an oblation ; but if the sons of men , cursed be they before Jehovah ; for they have driven me out this day from adhering to the inheritance of Jehovah , saying , Go , serve other gods .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	20	And now , let not my blood fall to the earth far from the face of Jehovah ; for the king of Israel is come out to seek a single flea , as when they hunt a partridge on the mountains .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	21	And Saul said , I have sinned : return , my son David ; for I will no more do thee harm , because my life was precious in thine eyes this day : behold , I have acted foolishly , and have erred exceedingly .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	22	And David answered and said , Behold the king 's spear , and let one of the young men come over and fetch it .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	23	And Jehovah will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness ; for Jehovah gave thee into [ my ] hand this day , and I would not stretch forth my hand against Jehovah 's anointed .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	24	And behold , as thy life was highly esteemed this day in mine eyes , so let my life be highly esteemed in the eyes of Jehovah , that he may deliver me out of all distress .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	26	25	And Saul said to David , Blessed be thou , my son David : thou shalt certainly do [ great things ] , and shalt certainly prevail . And David went on his way , and Saul returned to his place .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	27	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	27	27	And David said in his heart , I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul : there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines ; and Saul will despair of me to seek me any more within all the limits of Israel , and I shall escape out of his hand .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	27	2	And David arose and passed over , he and the six hundred men that were with him , to Achish , the son of Maoch , king of Gath .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	27	3	And David abode with Achish at Gath , he and his men , every man with his household ; David with his two wives , Ahinoam the Jizreelitess , and Abigail the Carmelitess , Nabal 's wife .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	27	4	And it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath ; and he sought no more for him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	27	5	And David said to Achish , If now I have found favour in thine eyes , let them give me a place in some country-town , that I may abide there ; for why should thy servant abide in the royal city with thee ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	27	6	And Achish gave him Ziklag that day ; therefore Ziklag belongs to the kings of Judah to this day .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	27	7	And the time that David abode in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	27	8	And David and his men went up and made a raid upon the Geshurites , and the Gerzites , and the Amalekites : for those were of old the inhabitants of the land , as thou goest to Shur , and as far as the land of Egypt .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	27	9	And David smote the land , and left neither man nor woman alive , and took away the sheep , and the oxen , and the asses , and the camels , and the apparel , and returned , and came to Achish .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	27	10	So Achish said , Have ye not made a raid to-day ? And David said , Against the south of Judah , and against the south of the Jerahmeelites , and against the south of the Kenites .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	27	11	And David left neither man nor woman alive , to bring [ them ] to Gath , for he said , Lest they should tell of us , saying , So did David . And such was his custom as long as he abode in the country of the Philistines .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	27	12	And Achish trusted David , saying , He has made himself utterly odious among his people Israel ; and he shall be my servant for ever .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	28	And it came to pass in those days that the Philistines gathered together their armies for warfare to fight against Israel . And Achish said to David , Know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out with me to the camp , thou and thy men .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	2	And David said to Achish , Thereby thou shalt know what thy servant can do . And Achish said to David , Therefore will I make thee keeper of my person for ever .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	3	( Now Samuel was dead , and all Israel had lamented him , and they had buried him in Ramah , even in his own city . And Saul had put away the necromancers and the soothsayers out of the land . )
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	4	And the Philistines gathered themselves together , and came and encamped in Shunem ; and Saul gathered all Israel together , and they encamped in Gilboa .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	5	And when Saul saw the camp of the Philistines , he was afraid , and his heart greatly trembled .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	6	And Saul inquired of Jehovah ; but Jehovah did not answer him , either by dreams , or by Urim , or by prophets .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	7	Then said Saul to his servants , Seek me a woman that has a spirit of Python , that I may go to her and inquire of her . And his servants said to him , Behold , there is a woman who has a spirit of Python at En-dor .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	8	And Saul disguised himself , and put on other garments , and he went , and two men with him , and they came to the woman by night ; and he said , I pray thee , divine to me by the spirit of Python , and bring me [ him ] up whom I shall name to thee .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	9	And the woman said to him , Behold , thou knowest what Saul has done , how he has cut off the necromancers and the soothsayers out of the land ; and why layest thou a snare for my life , to cause me to die ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	10	And Saul swore unto her by Jehovah , saying , [ As ] Jehovah liveth , there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	11	Then said the woman , Whom shall I bring up to thee ? And he said , Bring me up Samuel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	12	And when the woman saw Samuel , she cried out with a loud voice ; and the woman spoke to Saul , saying , Why hast thou deceived me ? Even thou art Saul .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	13	And the king said to her , Be not afraid ; but what didst thou see ? And the woman said to Saul , I saw a god ascending out of the earth .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	14	And he said to her , What is his form ? And she said , An old man comes up ; and he is covered with a mantle . And Saul knew that it was Samuel , and he stooped with his face to the ground , and bowed himself .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	15	And Samuel said to Saul , Why hast thou disquieted me , to bring me up ? And Saul said , I am sore distressed ; for the Philistines make war against me , and God is departed from me , and answers me no more , neither by prophets nor by dreams ; therefore I have called thee , that thou mayest make known to me what I shall do .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	16	And Samuel said , Why then dost thou inquire of me , seeing Jehovah is departed from thee , and is become thine enemy ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	17	And Jehovah has done for himself as he spoke by me ; and Jehovah has rent the kingdom out of thy hand , and given it to thy neighbour , to David .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	18	Because thou didst not hearken to the voice of Jehovah , and didst not execute his fierce anger upon Amalek , therefore has Jehovah done this thing to thee this day .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	19	And Jehovah will also give Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines ; and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me ; the army of Israel also will Jehovah give into the hand of the Philistines .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	20	And Saul fell straightway his full length on the earth , and was sore afraid because of the words of Samuel ; and there was no strength in him , for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	21	And the woman came to Saul , and saw that he was sore troubled , and said to him , Behold , thy bondmaid has hearkened to thy voice , and I have put my life in my hand , and have hearkened to thy words which thou spokest to me .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	22	And now , I pray thee , hearken thou also to the voice of thy bondmaid , and let me set a morsel of bread before thee ; and eat , that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy way .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	23	But he refused and said , I will not eat . Then his servants , and the woman also , compelled him , and he hearkened to their voice ; and he arose from the earth and sat on the bed .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	24	And the woman had a fat calf in the house ; and she hasted and killed it , and took flour , and kneaded it , and baked unleavened bread thereof ;
DARBY	1%20Samuel	28	25	and she brought it near before Saul , and before his servants , and they ate . And they rose up and went away that night .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	29	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	29	29	And the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek ; and Israel encamped by the spring that is in Jizreel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	29	2	And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands ; and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	29	3	And the princes of the Philistines said , What are these Hebrews ? And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines , Is not this David , the servant of Saul the king of Israel , who has been with me these days , or these years , and I have found nothing in him since the day of his falling away [ to me ] to this day ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	29	4	But the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him ; and the princes of the Philistines said to him , Make the man return , that he may go again to his place where thou hast appointed him , that he go not down with us to the battle , that in the battle he be not an adversary to us ; for wherewith should this [ fellow ] reconcile himself to his master ? should it not be with the heads of these men ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	29	5	Is not this David , of whom they sang one to another in dances , saying , Saul smote his thousands , and David his ten thousands ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	29	6	And Achish called David , and said to him , [ As ] Jehovah liveth , thou art upright , and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the camp is acceptable to me ; for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming to me to this day ; but thou art not acceptable to the lords .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	29	7	And now return , and go in peace , that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	29	8	And David said to Achish , But what have I done ? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee to this day , that I should not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king ?
DARBY	1%20Samuel	29	9	And Achish answered and said to David , I know that thou art acceptable to me , as an angel of God ; nevertheless the princes of the Philistines have said , He shall not go up with us to the battle .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	29	10	And now rise up early in the morning with thy master 's servants that are come with thee ; and rise ye early in the morning , and when ye have daylight , depart .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	29	11	And David rose up early , he and his men , to depart in the morning , to return into the land of the Philistines . And the Philistines went up to Jizreel .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	30	and to those in Hormah , and to those in Chor-ashan , and to those in Athach ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	2	and had taken the women captives that were in it ; both great and small : they had put none to death , but had carried them off , and went on their way .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	3	And David and his men came to the city , and behold , it was burnt with fire ; and their wives , and their sons , and their daughters were taken captives .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	4	Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept , until they had no more power to weep .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	5	And David 's two wives were taken captives , Ahinoam the Jizreelitess , and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	6	And David was greatly distressed ; for the people spoke of stoning him ; for the soul of all the people was embittered , every man because of his sons and because of his daughters ; but David strengthened himself in Jehovah his God .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	7	And David said to Abiathar the priest , Ahimelech 's son , Bring near to me , I pray thee , the ephod . And Abiathar brought the ephod near to David .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	8	And David inquired of Jehovah , saying , Shall I pursue after this troop ? shall I overtake them ? And he said to him , Pursue ; for thou shalt assuredly overtake [ them ] and shalt certainly recover .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	9	So David went , he and the six hundred men that were with him , and they came to the torrent Besor ; and those that were left stayed behind .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	10	And David pursued , he and four hundred men ; for two hundred stayed behind , who were too exhausted to go over the torrent Besor .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	11	And they found an Egyptian in the field , and brought him to David , and gave him bread , and he ate ; and they gave him water to drink ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	12	and gave him a piece of fig-cake and two raisin-cakes , and he ate , and his spirit came again to him ; for he had eaten no bread , nor drunk any water , for three days and three nights .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	13	And David said to him , To whom belongest thou ? and whence art thou ? And he said , I am a young man of Egypt , servant of an Amalekite ; and my master left me , because three days ago I fell sick .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	14	We made a raid against the south of the Cherethites , and against what [ belongs ] to Judah , and against the south of Caleb ; and we burned Ziklag with fire .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	15	And David said to him , Canst thou bring me down to this troop ? And he said , Swear to me by God , that thou wilt neither put me to death nor deliver me up into the hand of my master , and I will bring thee down to this troop .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	16	And he brought him down , and behold , they were spread over the whole land , eating and drinking , and dancing , because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines , and out of the land of Judah .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	17	And David smote them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day ; and there escaped not a man of them , save four hundred young men , who rode upon camels , and fled .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	18	And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken : and David recovered his two wives .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	19	And there was nothing missed by them , neither small nor great , neither sons nor daughters , neither spoil nor anything that they had taken : David brought all back .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	20	And David took all the flocks and the herds , [ which ] they drove before the other cattle , and said , This is David 's spoil .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	21	And David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David , and whom they had left behind at the torrent Besor ; and they went forth to meet David , and to meet the people that were with him ; and David drew near to the people and saluted them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	22	And all the wicked men , and [ men ] of Belial , of those that had gone with David , answered and said , Because they went not with us , we will not give them [ aught ] of the spoil that we have recovered , save to every man his wife and his children , that they may lead [ them ] away and depart .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	23	Then said David , Ye shall not do so , my brethren , with that which Jehovah has given us , who has preserved us , and given the troop that came against us into our hand .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	24	And who will hearken to you in this matter ? For as his share is that goes down to the battle , so shall his share be that abides by the baggage : they shall share alike .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	25	And it was [ so ] from that day forward ; and he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	26	And David came to Ziklag , and he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah , to his friends , saying , Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah :
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	27	to those in Bethel , and to those in south Ramoth , and to those in Jattir ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	28	and to those in Aroer , and to those in Siphmoth , and to those in Eshtemoa ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	29	and to those in Rachal , and to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites , and to those in the cities of the Kenites ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	30	31	and to those in Hebron , and to all the places where David himself and his men went about .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	31	1	Samuel
DARBY	1%20Samuel	31	31	And the Philistines fought against Israel ; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain on mount Gilboa .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	31	2	And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons ; and the Philistines smote Jonathan , and Abinadab , and Malchishua , Saul 's sons .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	31	3	And the battle went sore against Saul , and the archers came up with him ; and he was much terrified by the archers .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	31	4	Then said Saul to his armour-bearer , Draw thy sword , and thrust me through with it ; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through , and abuse me . But his armour-bearer would not ; for he was much afraid . So Saul took the sword and fell on it .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	31	5	And when his armour-bearer saw that Saul was dead , he fell likewise on his sword , and died with him .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	31	6	So Saul died , and his three sons , and his armour-bearer , and all his men , that same day together .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	31	7	And when the men of Israel that were on this side of the valley , and [ they ] that were on this side of the Jordan , saw that the men of Israel fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they forsook the cities and fled ; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	31	8	And it came to pass the next day , that the Philistines came to strip the slain , and they found Saul and his three sons fallen on mount Gilboa .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	31	9	And they cut off his head , and stripped off his armour , and sent [ them ] into the land of the Philistines round about , to announce the glad tidings in the houses of their idols , and to the people .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	31	10	And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth ; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	31	11	And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead heard of what the Philistines had done to Saul ,
DARBY	1%20Samuel	31	12	all the valiant men arose and went all night , and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan , and came to Jabesh , and burned them there .
DARBY	1%20Samuel	31	13	And they took their bones , and buried them under the tamarisk at Jabesh , and fasted seven days .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	2	And it came to pass on the third day , that behold , a man came out of the camp from Saul with his garments rent , and earth upon his head ; and as soon as he came to David , he fell to the earth and did obeisance .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	1	And it came to pass after the death of Saul , when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites , that David abode two days in Ziklag .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	3	And David said to him , Whence comest thou ? And he said to him , Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	4	And David said to him , What has taken place ? I pray thee , tell me . And he said that the people had fled from the battle , and many of the people also had fallen and died , and that Saul and Jonathan his son were dead also .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	5	And David said to the young man that told him , How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	6	And the young man that told him said , I happened by chance to be upon mount Gilboa , and behold , Saul leaned on his spear ; and behold , the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	7	And he looked behind him , and saw me , and called to me . And I said , Here am I .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	8	And he said to me , Who art thou ? And I said to him , I am an Amalekite .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	9	He said to me again , Stand , I pray thee , over me , and slay me ; for anguish has seized me ; for my life is yet whole in me .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	10	So I stood over him , and put him to death , for I knew that he would not live after his fall ; and I took the crown that was upon his head , and the bracelet that was on his arm , and have brought them hither to my lord .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	11	Then David took hold of his garments and rent them ; and all the men that were with him [ did ] likewise .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	12	And they mourned , and wept , and fasted until even for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of Jehovah , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	13	And David said to the young man that told him , Whence art thou ? And he said , I am the son of an Amalekite stranger .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	14	And David said to him , How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thy hand to destroy Jehovah 's anointed ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	15	Then David called one of the young men and said , Draw near , [ and ] fall on him . And he smote him that he died .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	16	And David said to him , Thy blood be upon thy head ; for thy mouth has testified against thee , saying , I have slain Jehovah 's anointed .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	17	And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	18	and he bade them teach the children of Judah [ the song of ] the bow . Behold , it is written in the book of Jasher : —
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	19	The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places : how are the mighty fallen !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	20	Tell [ it ] not in Gath , carry not the tidings in the streets of Ashkelon ; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice , Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	21	Ye mountains of Gilboa , let there be no dew , no rain upon you , nor fields of heave-offerings ! For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away , The shield of Saul , [ as ] not anointed with oil .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	22	From the blood of the slain , from the fat of the mighty , The bow of Jonathan turned not back , And the sword of Saul returned not empty .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	23	Saul and Jonathan , beloved and pleasant in their lives , Even in their death were not divided ; They were swifter than eagles , they were stronger than lions .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	24	Ye daughters of Israel , weep over Saul , who clothed you in scarlet with splendour , Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	25	How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle ! Jonathan is slain upon thy high places .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	26	I am distressed for thee , my brother Jonathan : very pleasant wast thou unto me ; Thy love to me was wonderful , passing women 's love .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	1	27	How are the mighty fallen , and the instruments of war perished !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	2	So David went up thither , and his two wives also , Ahinoam the Jizreelitess , and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	3	And his men that were with him did David bring up , every man with his household ; and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	4	And the men of Judah came , and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah . And they told David , saying , It is the men of Jabesh-Gilead that have buried Saul .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	5	And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-Gilead , and said to them , Blessed be ye of Jehovah , that ye have shewn this kindness to your lord , to Saul , and have buried him !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	6	And now Jehovah shew kindness and faithfulness to you ; and I also will requite you this good , because ye have done this thing .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	7	And now let your hands be strong , and be ye valiant ; for your master Saul is dead , and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	8	And Abner the son of Ner , captain of Saul 's host , took Ishbosheth the son of Saul , and brought him over to Mahanaim ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	9	and made him king over Gilead , and over the Asshurites , and over Jizreel , and over Ephraim , and over Benjamin , and over all Israel .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	10	Ishbosheth Saul 's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel , and he reigned two years . However , the house of Judah followed David .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	11	And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	12	And Abner the son of Ner , and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul , went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	13	And Joab the son of Zeruiah , and the servants of David , went out . And they met together by the pool of Gibeon ; and they sat down , these on the one side of the pool , and those on the other side of the pool .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	14	And Abner said to Joab , Let the young men now arise and make sport before us . And Joab said , Let them arise .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	15	And they arose and went over by number , twelve for Benjamin , and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul , and twelve of the servants of David .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	16	And they caught every one his fellow by the head , and [ thrust ] his sword in his fellow 's side , and they fell down together . And that place was called Helkath-hazzurim , which is by Gibeon .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	17	And the battle that day was very severe ; and Abner and the men of Israel were routed before the servants of David .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	18	And there were three sons of Zeruiah there , Joab , and Abishai , and Asahel . Now Asahel was swift of foot , as one of the gazelles that are in the field .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	19	And Asahel pursued after Abner ; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from behind Abner .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	20	Then Abner looked behind him , and said , Art thou Asahel ? And he said , I am .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	21	And Abner said to him , Turn thee aside , to thy right hand or to thy left , and lay hold of one of the young men , and take for thyself his armour . But Asahel would not turn aside from following him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	22	And Abner said again to Asahel , Turn thee aside from following me : why should I smite thee to the ground ? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	23	But he refused to turn aside ; therefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him in the belly , so that the spear came out behind him ; and he fell down there , and died in the same place . And it came to pass , that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	24	And Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner ; and the sun went down when they came to the hill of Ammah , which is before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	25	And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner , and became one troop , and stood on the top of a hill .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	26	And Abner called to Joab , and said , Shall the sword devour for ever ? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end ? and how long shall it be ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	27	And Joab said , [ As ] God liveth , unless thou hadst spoken , surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	28	And Joab blew the trumpet , and all the people stood still , and pursued after Israel no more , neither did they fight any more .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	29	And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain , and passed over the Jordan , and went through all Bithron , and they came to Mahanaim .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	30	And Joab returned from following Abner , and gathered all the people together ; and there lacked of David 's servants nineteen men , and Asahel .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	31	And the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin , and of Abner 's men , three hundred and sixty men , who had died .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	2	32	And they took up Asahel , and buried him in the sepulchre of his father , which was in Bethlehem . And Joab and his men went all night , and they came to Hebron at break of day .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	2	And to David were sons born in Hebron : his firstborn was Amnon , of Ahinoam the Jizreelitess ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	3	and his second , Chileab , of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite ; and the third , Absalom the son of Maachah , daughter of Talmai king of Geshur ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	4	and the fourth , Adonijah the son of Haggith ; and the fifth , Shephatiah the son of Abital ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	5	and the sixth , Ithream , of Eglah David 's wife . These were born to David in Hebron .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	6	And it came to pass while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David , that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	7	And Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah , the daughter of Aiah . And [ Ishbosheth ] said to Abner , Why hast thou gone in to my father 's concubine ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	8	Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth , and said , Am I a dog 's head , I who against Judah do shew kindness this day to the house of Saul thy father , to his brethren , and to his friends , and have not delivered thee into the hand of David , that thou reproachest me this day with the fault of this woman ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	9	So do God to Abner , and more also , if , as Jehovah has sworn to David , I do not so to him ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	10	to translate the kingdom from the house of Saul , and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah , from Dan even to Beer-sheba !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	11	And he could not answer Abner a word again , because he feared him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	12	And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf , saying , Whose is the land ? saying [ also ] , Make thy covenant with me , and behold , my hand shall be with thee , to turn all Israel to thee .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	13	And he said , Well , I will make a covenant with thee ; only I require one thing of thee , that is , Thou shalt not see my face , except thou first bring Michal Saul 's daughter , when thou comest to see my face .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	14	And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul 's son , saying , Deliver me my wife Michal , whom I espoused to me for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	15	And Ishbosheth sent , and took her from [ her ] husband , from Phaltiel the son of Laish .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	16	And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim . Then said Abner to him , Go , return . And he returned .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	17	Now Abner had communicated with the elders of Israel , saying , Ye sought for David aforetime to be king over you ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	18	and now do [ it ] , for Jehovah has spoken of David , saying , By my servant David will I save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines , and out of the hand of all their enemies .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	19	And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin ; and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel , and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	20	So Abner came to David to Hebron , and twenty men with him . And David made Abner and the men that were with him a repast .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	21	And Abner said to David , I will arise and go , and will gather all Israel to my lord the king , that they may make a covenant with thee , and that thou mayest reign over all that thy heart desires . And David sent Abner away ; and he went in peace .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	22	And behold , the servants of David and Joab came from an expedition , and brought in a great spoil with them ; but Abner was no longer with David in Hebron , for he had sent him away , and he had gone in peace .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	23	And Joab and all the host that was with him came ; and they told Joab , saying , Abner the son of Ner came to the king , and he has sent him away ; and he is gone in peace .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	24	Then Joab came to the king , and said , What hast thou done ? behold , Abner came to thee ; why is it [ that ] thou hast sent him away , and he is gone ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	25	Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner , that he came to deceive thee , to know thy going out and thy coming in , and to know all that thou doest .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	26	And when Joab was come out from David , he sent messengers after Abner , who brought him again from the well of Sirah ; but David did not know it .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	27	And when Abner was returned to Hebron , Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him secretly , and smote him there in the belly , that he died , for the blood of Asahel his brother .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	28	And afterwards David heard [ it ] , and he said , I and my kingdom are guiltless before Jehovah for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner :
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	29	let it fall on the head of Joab , and on all his father 's house ; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that has an issue , or that is a leper , or that leans on a staff , or that falls by the sword , or that lacks bread !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	30	So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner , because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	31	And David said to Joab , and to all the people that were with him , Rend your garments , and gird yourselves with sackcloth , and mourn before Abner . And king David followed the bier .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	32	And they buried Abner in Hebron ; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner ; and all the people wept .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	33	And the king lamented over Abner , and said , Should Abner die as a fool dieth ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	34	Thy hands were not bound , Nor thy feet put into fetters ; As a man falleth before wicked men , Fellest thou ! And all the people wept again over him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	35	And all the people came to cause David to eat bread while it was yet day ; but David swore , saying , So do God to me , and more also , if I taste bread or aught else till the sun be down !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	36	And all the people remarked it , and it pleased them ; as whatever the king did pleased all the people .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	37	And all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	38	And the king said to his servants , Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	3	39	And I am this day weak , though anointed king ; and these men , the sons of Zeruiah , are too hard for me : Jehovah reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	4	2	And Saul 's son had two men , captains of bands : the name of the one was Baanah , and the name of the other Rechab , the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , of the children of Benjamin ; for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	4	4	And Jonathan Saul 's son had a son that was lame of [ his ] feet . He was five years old when the news came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jizreel ; and his nurse took him up and fled . And it came to pass , as she made haste to flee , that he fell , and became lame . And his name was Mephibosheth .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	4	3	And the Beerothites had fled to Gittaim , and were sojourners there until this day .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	4	5	And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , Rechab and Baanah , went and came in about the heat of the day into the house of Ishbosheth , who was taking his noonday rest .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	4	6	And they came thither into the midst of the house , [ as though ] they would fetch wheat ; and they smote him in the belly ; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	4	7	They came into the house , as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber , and they smote him , and slew him , and beheaded him ; and they took his head , and went by the way of the plain all night .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	4	8	And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David in Hebron , and said to the king , Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul , thine enemy who sought thy life ; and Jehovah has given to my lord the king to be avenged this day of Saul and of his seed .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	4	9	Then David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother , the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , and said to them , [ As ] Jehovah liveth , who has redeemed my soul out of all distress ,
DARBY	2%20Samuel	4	10	when one told me , saying , Behold , Saul is dead ! and he was in his own sight a messenger of good , I took hold of him , and slew him in Ziklag—to whom forsooth I should give a reward for his good tidings :
DARBY	2%20Samuel	4	11	how much more , when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed ? and should I not now demand his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	4	12	And David commanded his young men , and they slew them , and cut off their hands and their feet , and hanged [ them ] up over the pool in Hebron . But they took the head of Ishbosheth , and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	2	Even aforetime , when Saul was king over us , thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel ; and Jehovah said to thee , Thou shalt feed my people Israel , and thou shalt be prince over Israel .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	5	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months ; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	3	And all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron ; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah ; and they anointed David king over Israel .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	4	David was thirty years old when he began to reign ; he reigned forty years .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	6	And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites , the inhabitants of the land ; and they spoke to David , saying , Thou shalt not come in hither , but the blind and the lame will drive thee back ; as much as to say , David will not come in hither .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	7	But David took the stronghold of Zion , which is the city of David .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	8	And David said on that day , Whoever smites the Jebusites and gets up to the watercourse , and the lame and the blind hated of David 's soul … ! Therefore they say , The blind and the lame shall not come into the house .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	9	So David dwelt in the stronghold , and called it the city of David . And David built round about from the Millo and inward .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	10	And David became continually greater ; and Jehovah the God of hosts was with him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	11	And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David , and timber of cedars , and carpenters , and masons ; and they built David a house .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	12	And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel , and that he had exalted his kingdom because of his people Israel .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	13	And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem , after he had come from Hebron ; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	14	And these are the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem : Shammua , and Shobab , and Nathan , and Solomon ,
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	15	and Ibhar , and Elishua , and Nepheg , and Japhia ,
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	16	and Elishama , and Eliada , and Eliphelet .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	17	And the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel , and all the Philistines went up to seek David ; and David heard [ of it ] , and went down to the stronghold .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	18	And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	19	And David inquired of Jehovah , saying , Shall I go up against the Philistines ? wilt thou give them into my hand ? And Jehovah said to David , Go up ; for I will certainly give the Philistines into thy hand .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	20	And David came to Baal-perazim , and David smote them there ; and he said , Jehovah has broken in upon mine enemies before me , as the breaking forth of waters . Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	21	And they left their images there , and David and his men took them away .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	22	And the Philistines came up yet again , and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	23	And David inquired of Jehovah ; and he said , Thou shalt not go up ; turn round behind them and come upon them opposite the mulberry-trees .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	24	And it shall be , when thou hearest a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees , that then thou shalt bestir thyself ; for then will Jehovah have gone forth before thee , to smite the army of the Philistines .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	5	25	And David did so , as Jehovah had commanded him ; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou comest to Gezer .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	2	And David arose and went with all the people that were with him from Baale-Judah , to bring up from thence the ark of God which is called by the name , the name of Jehovah of hosts who sitteth between the cherubim .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	6	And when they came to Nachon 's threshing-floor , Uzzah reached after the ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the oxen had stumbled .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	3	And they set the ark of God upon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab , which was upon the hill ; and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drove the new cart .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	4	And they brought it with the ark of God out of the house of Abinadab which was upon the hill ; and Ahio went before the ark .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	5	And David and all the house of Israel played before Jehovah on all manner of [ instruments made of ] cypress wood , with harps , and with lutes , and with tambours , and with sistra , and with cymbals .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	7	And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzzah ; and God smote him there for his error ; and there he died by the ark of God .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	8	And David was indignant , because Jehovah had made a breach upon Uzzah ; and he called that place Perez-Uzzah to this day .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	9	And David was afraid of Jehovah that day , and said , How shall the ark of Jehovah come to me ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	10	So David would not bring the ark of Jehovah home unto himself into the city of David ; but David carried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	11	And the ark of Jehovah remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite three months ; and Jehovah blessed Obed-Edom and all his household .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	12	And it was told king David , saying , Jehovah has blessed the house of Obed-Edom , and all that is his , because of the ark of God . And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom into the city of David with joy .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	13	And it was so , that when they that bore the ark of Jehovah had gone six paces , he sacrificed an ox and a fatted beast .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	14	And David danced before Jehovah with all his might ; and David was girded with a linen ephod .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	15	And David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Jehovah with shouting , and with the sound of the trumpet .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	16	And as the ark of Jehovah came into the city of David , Michal the daughter of Saul looked through a window , and saw king David leaping and dancing before Jehovah ; and she despised him in her heart .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	17	And they brought in the ark of Jehovah , and set it in its place , in the midst of the tent that David had spread for it . And David offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	18	And when David had ended offering up the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings , he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	19	And he dealt to all the people , to the whole multitude of Israel , both men and women , to every one a cake of bread , and a measure [ of wine ] , and a raisin-cake . And all the people departed every one to his house .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	20	And David returned to bless his household . And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David , and said , How honourable did the king of Israel make himself to-day , who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants , as one of the lewd fellows shamelessly uncovers himself !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	21	And David said to Michal , It was before Jehovah , who chose me rather than thy father , and than all his house , to appoint me ruler over the people of Jehovah , over Israel ; and I played before Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	22	And I will make myself yet more vile than thus , and will be base in mine own sight ; and of the handmaids that thou hast spoken of , of them shall I be had in honour .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	6	23	And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	2	that the king said to Nathan the prophet , See now , I dwell in a house of cedars , and the ark of God dwells under curtains .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	7	In all my going about with all the children of Israel , did I speak a word with any of the tribes of Israel , whom I commanded to feed my people Israel , saying , Why build ye me not a house of cedars ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	3	And Nathan said to the king , Go , do all that is in thy heart ; for Jehovah is with thee .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	4	And it came to pass that night that the word of Jehovah came to Nathan , saying ,
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	5	Go and say to my servant , to David , Thus saith Jehovah : Wilt thou build me a house for me to dwell in ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	6	For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but I went about in a tent and in a tabernacle .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	8	And now , thus shalt thou say unto my servant David , Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : I took thee from the pasture-grounds , from following the sheep , to be prince over my people , over Israel ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	9	and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest , and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee , and have made thee a great name , like unto the name of the great men that are on the earth .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	10	And I will appoint a place for my people , for Israel , and will plant them , that they may dwell in a place of their own , and be disturbed no more ; neither shall the sons of wickedness afflict them any more , as formerly ,
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	11	and since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel . And I have given thee rest from all thine enemies ; and Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a house .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	12	When thy days are fulfilled , and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers , I will set up thy seed after thee , which shall proceed out of thy bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	13	It is he who shall build a house for my name , and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	14	I will be his father , and he shall be my son . If he commit iniquity , I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the sons of men ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	15	but my mercy shall not depart away from him , as I took it from Saul , whom I put away from before thee .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	16	And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made firm for ever before thee : thy throne shall be established for ever .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	17	According to all these words , and according to all this vision , so did Nathan speak to David .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	18	And king David went in and sat before Jehovah , and said , Who am I , Lord Jehovah , and what is my house , that thou hast brought me hitherto ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	19	And yet this hath been a small thing in thy sight , Lord Jehovah ; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant 's house for a great while to come . And is this the manner of man , Lord Jehovah ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	20	And what can David say more to thee ? for thou , Lord Jehovah , knowest thy servant .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	21	For thy word 's sake , and according to thine own heart , hast thou done all this greatness , to make thy servant know [ it ] .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	22	Wherefore thou art great , Jehovah Elohim ; for there is none like thee , neither is there any God beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	23	And who is like thy people , like Israel , the one nation in the earth that God went to redeem to be a people to himself , and to make himself a name , and to do for them great things and terrible , for thy land , before thy people , which thou redeemedst to thyself from Egypt , from the nations and their gods ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	24	And thou hast established to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever ; and thou , Jehovah , art become their God .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	25	And now , Jehovah Elohim , the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house , fulfil it for ever , and do as thou hast said .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	26	And let thy name be magnified for ever , saying , Jehovah of hosts is God over Israel ; and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	27	For thou , Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel , hast revealed to thy servant , saying , I will build thee a house ; therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	28	And now , Lord Jehovah , thou art that God , and thy words are true , and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	7	29	and now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may be before thee for ever ; for thou , Lord Jehovah , hast spoken it ; and with thy blessing shall the house of thy servant be blessed for ever .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	2	And he smote the Moabites , and measured them with a line , making them lie down on the ground ; and he measured two lines to put to death , and one full line to keep alive . And the Moabites became David 's servants , [ and ] brought gifts .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	8	And from Betah , and from Berothai , cities of Hadadezer , king David took exceeding much bronze .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	3	And David smote Hadadezer , the son of Rehob , king of Zobah , as he went to recover his dominion by the river Euphrates .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	4	And David took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen , and twenty thousand footmen ; and David houghed all the chariot [ horses ] , but reserved of them [ for ] a hundred chariots .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	5	And the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah , and David smote of the Syrians twenty-two thousand men .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	6	And David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus ; and the Syrians became servants to David , [ and ] brought gifts . And Jehovah preserved David whithersoever he went .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	7	And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer , and brought them to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	9	And Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the forces of Hadadezer ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	10	and Toi sent Joram his son to king David , to inquire of his welfare , and to congratulate him , because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him ; for Hadadezer was continually at war with Toi . And he brought with him vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and vessels of bronze .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	11	Them also king David dedicated to Jehovah , with the silver and the gold that he had dedicated of all the nations that he had subdued :
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	12	of the Syrians , and of the Moabites , and of the children of Ammon , and of the Philistines , and of the Amalekites , and of the spoil of Hadadezer , the son of Rehob , king of Zobah .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	13	And David made him a name when he returned , after he had smitten the Syrians in the valley of salt , eighteen thousand [ men ] .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	14	And he put garrisons in Edom : throughout Edom did he put garrisons ; and all they of Edom became servants to David . And Jehovah preserved David whithersoever he went .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	15	And David reigned over all Israel ; and David executed judgment and justice to all his people .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	16	And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host ; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was chronicler ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	17	and Zadok the son of Ahitub , and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar , were the priests ; and Seraiah was scribe ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	8	18	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and David 's sons were chief rulers .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	9	2	And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba ; and they called him to David . And the king said to him , Art thou Ziba ? And he said , Thy servant !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	9	9	Then the king called Ziba , Saul 's servant , and said to him , I have given to thy master 's son all that belonged to Saul and to all his house .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	9	3	And the king said , Is there not yet any of the house of Saul , that I may shew the kindness of God to him ? And Ziba said to the king , Jonathan has yet a son , who is lame on [ his ] feet .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	9	4	And the king said to him , Where is he ? And Ziba said to the king , Behold , he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel , in Lodebar .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	9	5	And king David sent , and fetched him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel , from Lodebar .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	9	6	And Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan , the son of Saul , came to David , and fell on his face and did obeisance . And David said , Mephibosheth . And he said , Behold thy servant !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	9	7	And David said to him , Fear not ; for I will certainly shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father 's sake , and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father ; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	9	8	And he bowed himself , and said , What is thy servant , that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	9	10	And thou , and thy sons , and thy servants , shall till the land for him , and thou shalt bring in [ the fruits ] , that thy master 's son may have food to eat . And Mephibosheth thy master 's son shall eat bread at my table continually . Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	9	11	And Ziba said to the king , According to all that my lord the king has commanded his servant , so will thy servant do . And Mephibosheth [ said David ] shall eat at my table , as one of the king 's sons .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	9	12	And Mephibosheth had a young son , whose name was Mica . And all who dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	9	13	So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem ; for he did eat continually at the king 's table . And he was lame on both his feet .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	2	And David said , I will shew kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash , as his father shewed kindness to me . And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father . And David 's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	10	and the rest of the people he gave into the hand of Abishai his brother that he might array them against the children of Ammon .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	3	And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord , Is it , in thine eyes , to honour thy father that David has sent comforters to thee ? Is it not to search the city and to spy it out , and to overthrow it , that David has sent his servants to thee ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	4	And Hanun took David 's servants , and had the one half of their beards shaved off , and their raiment cut off in the midst , as far as their buttocks , and sent them away .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	5	And they told [ it ] to David ; and he sent to meet them , for the men were greatly ashamed . And the king said , Abide at Jericho until your beards be grown , and then return .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	6	And the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David ; and the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-Rehob , and the Syrians of Zoba , twenty thousand footmen , and the king of Maacah [ with ] a thousand men , and the men of Tob twelve thousand men .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	7	And David heard [ of it ] , and he sent Joab , and all the host , the mighty men .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	8	And the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate ; and the Syrians of Zoba and of Rehob , and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the field .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	9	And Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind ; and he chose out of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	11	And he said , If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me ; and if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee , then I will come and help thee .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	12	Be strong , and let us shew ourselves valiant for our people and for the cities of our God ; and Jehovah do what is good in his sight .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	13	And Joab drew near , and the people that were with him , unto the battle against the Syrians ; and they fled before him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	14	And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians fled , they fled before Abishai , and entered into the city . And Joab returned from the children of Ammon , and came to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	15	And when the Syrians saw that they were routed before Israel , they gathered themselves together .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	16	And Hadarezer sent , and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river ; and they came to Helam ; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer [ went ] before them .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	17	And it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel , and passed over the Jordan , and came to Helam . And the Syrians set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	18	And the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David slew of the Syrians seven hundred [ in ] chariots , and forty thousand horsemen , and smote Shobach the captain of their host , who died there .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	10	19	And all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were routed before Israel , and they made peace with Israel , and served them . And the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	2	And it came to pass at evening time that David arose from off his couch , and walked upon the roof of the king 's house ; and from the roof he saw a woman bathing , and the woman was very beautiful ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	11	And Urijah said to David , The ark , and Israel , and Judah abide in booths ; and my lord Joab , and the servants of my lord , are encamped in the open fields : shall I then go into my house , to eat and to drink , and to lie with my wife ? [ As ] thou livest , and [ as ] thy soul liveth , I will not do this thing .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	3	and David sent and inquired after the woman . And one said , Is not this Bathsheba , the daughter of Eliam , the wife of Urijah the Hittite ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	4	And David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in to him , and he lay with her ; and she had purified herself from her uncleanness ; and she returned to her house .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	5	And the woman conceived , and sent and told David , and said , I am with child .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	6	And David sent to Joab [ saying ] , Send me Urijah the Hittite . And Joab sent Urijah to David .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	7	And when Urijah had come to him , David asked how Joab prospered , and how the people prospered , and how the war prospered .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	8	And David said to Urijah , Go down to thy house and wash thy feet . And Urijah departed out of the king 's house , and there followed him presents from the king .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	9	And Urijah slept at the entrance of the king 's house with all the servants of his lord , and went not down to his house .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	10	And they had told David saying , Urijah did not go down to his house ; and David said to Urijah , Art thou not come from a journey ? why didst thou not go down to thy house ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	12	And David said to Urijah , Abide here to-day also , and to-morrow I will let thee depart . And Urijah abode in Jerusalem that day and the morrow .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	13	And David invited him , and he ate and drank before him ; and he made him drunk . And in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord , but did not go down to his house .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	14	And it came to pass in the morning , that David wrote a letter to Joab , and sent it by Urijah .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	15	And he wrote in the letter saying , Set Urijah in the front of the thickest fight , and withdraw from him , that he may be smitten and die .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	16	And it came to pass as Joab watched the city , that he assigned Urijah to a place where he knew that the valiant men were .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	17	And the men of the city went out and fought with Joab ; and there fell some of the people , of the servants of David ; and Urijah the Hittite died also .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	18	Then Joab sent and told David all the matters of the war ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	19	and charged the messenger , saying , When thou hast ended telling the matters of the war to the king ,
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	20	and if so be that the king 's wrath arise , and he say to thee , Why did ye go so near to the city to fight ? did ye not know that they would shoot from the wall ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	21	Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth ? did not a woman cast the upper stone of a handmill from the wall , that he died in Thebez ? why did ye go near the wall ? —then say thou , Thy servant Urijah the Hittite is dead also .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	22	And the messenger went ; and he came and told David all that Joab had sent him for .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	23	And the messenger said to David , The men prevailed against us , and came out against us into the field , and we were upon them as far as the entrance of the gate .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	24	And the shooters shot from upon the wall against thy servants ; and some of the king 's servants are dead , and thy servant Urijah the Hittite is dead also .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	25	Then David said to the messenger , Thus shalt thou say to Joab : Let not this thing displease thee , for the sword devours one as well as another : make thy battle strong against the city , and overthrow it ; —and encourage him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	26	And the wife of Urijah heard that Urijah her husband was dead , and she mourned for her husband .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	11	27	And when the mourning was past , David sent and fetched her to his house , and she became his wife , and bore him a son . But the thing that David had done was evil in the sight of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	2	The rich had very many flocks and herds ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	12	For thou didst [ it ] secretly ; but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	3	but the poor man had nothing at all , but one little ewe lamb which he had bought , and was nourishing ; and it grew up with him , and together with his children : it ate of his morsel , and drank of his own cup , and slept in his bosom , and was to him as a daughter .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	4	And there came a traveller to the rich man , and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd , to dress for the wayfaring man that had come to him ; and he took the poor man 's lamb , and dressed it for the man that had come to him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	5	Then David 's anger was greatly kindled against the man ; and he said to Nathan , As Jehovah liveth , the man that hath done this thing is worthy of death ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	6	and he shall restore the lamb fourfold , because he did this thing , and because he had no pity .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	7	And Nathan said to David , Thou art the man ! Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel : I anointed thee king over Israel , and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	8	and I gave thee thy master 's house , and thy master 's wives into thy bosom , and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah ; and if [ that ] had been too little , I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	9	Wherefore hast thou despised the word of Jehovah to do evil in his sight ? thou hast smitten Urijah the Hittite with the sword , and hast taken his wife to be thy wife , and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	10	Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thy house ; because thou hast despised me , and hast taken the wife of Urijah the Hittite to be thy wife .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	11	Thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house , and I will take thy wives before thine eyes , and give them unto thy neighbour , and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	13	And David said to Nathan , I have sinned against Jehovah . And Nathan said to David , Jehovah has also put away thy sin : thou shalt not die .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	14	Howbeit , because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme , even the child that is born to thee shall certainly die .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	15	And Nathan departed to his house . And Jehovah smote the child that Urijah 's wife bore to David , and it became very sick .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	16	And David besought God for the child ; and David fasted , and went in , and lay all night on the earth .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	17	And the elders of his house arose , [ and went ] to him , to raise him up from the earth ; but he would not , and he ate no bread with them .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	18	And it came to pass on the seventh day , that the child died . And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead ; for they said , Behold , while the child was yet alive , we spoke to him , and he would not hearken to our voice ; and how shall we say to him , The child is dead ? he may do some harm .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	19	But David saw that his servants whispered , and David perceived that the child was dead ; and David said to his servants , Is the child dead ? And they said , He is dead .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	20	Then David arose from the earth , and washed , and anointed himself , and changed his clothing , and entered into the house of Jehovah and worshipped ; then he came to his own house and required them to set bread before him , and he ate .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	21	And his servants said to him , What thing is this which thou hast done ? thou didst fast and weep for the child alive ; but as soon as the child is dead , thou dost rise and eat bread .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	22	And he said , While the child was yet alive , I fasted and wept ; for I thought , Who knows ? [ perhaps ] Jehovah will be gracious to me , that the child may live .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	23	But now he is dead , why should I fast ? can I bring him back again ? I shall go to him , but he will not return to me .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	24	And David comforted Bathsheba his wife , and went in to her and lay with her ; and she bore a son , and he called his name Solomon ; and Jehovah loved him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	25	And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet ; and he called his name Jedidiah , for Jehovah 's sake .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	26	And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and took the royal city .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	27	And Joab sent messengers to David , and said , I have fought against Rabbah , and have taken the city of waters .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	28	And now gather the rest of the people , and encamp against the city and take it : lest I take the city and it be called by my name .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	29	And David gathered all the people , and went to Rabbah , and fought against it and took it .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	30	And he took the crown of their king from off his head , the weight of which was a talent of gold with [ the ] precious stones ; and it was [ set ] on David 's head ; and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	12	31	And he brought out the people that were in it , and put them under the saw , and under harrows of iron , and under axes of iron , and made them pass through the brickkilns . And so did he to all the cities of the children of Ammon . And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	2	And Amnon was so vexed , that he fell sick for his sister Tamar ; for she was a virgin ; and it seemed difficult for Amnon to do the least thing to her .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	13	And I , whither shall I carry my reproach ? and thou wouldest be as one of the infamous in Israel . And now , I pray thee , speak to the king ; for he will not withhold me from thee .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	3	And Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab , the son of Shimeah David 's brother ; and Jonadab was a very shrewd man .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	4	And he said to him , Why dost thou , the king 's son , get thinner from morning to morning ? Wilt thou not tell me ? And Amnon said to him , I love Tamar , my brother Absalom 's sister .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	5	And Jonadab said to him , Lay thee down on thy bed and feign thyself sick ; and when thy father comes to see thee , say to him , I pray thee , let my sister Tamar come , and give me food , and dress the food in my sight , that I may see it , and eat it from her hand .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	6	So Amnon lay down and feigned himself sick ; and the king came to see him , and Amnon said to the king , I pray thee , let Tamar my sister come , and make a couple of cakes in my sight , that I may eat from her hand .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	7	And David sent home to Tamar , saying , Go , I pray thee , to thy brother Amnon 's house , and dress him food .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	8	And Tamar went to her brother Amnon 's house ; and he had lain down . And she took flour and kneaded it , and made cakes in his sight , and baked the cakes .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	9	And she took the pan , and poured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . And Amnon said , Put every man out from me . And they went out every man from him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	10	And Amnon said to Tamar , Bring the dish into the chamber , that I may eat of thy hand . And Tamar took the cakes that she had made , and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	11	And she presented them to him to eat ; and he took hold of her , and said to her , Come , lie with me , my sister .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	12	And she said to him , No , my brother , do not humble me ; for no such thing is done in Israel : do not this infamy .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	14	But he would not hearken to her voice , and was stronger than she , and humbled her and lay with her .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	15	And Amnon hated her with an exceeding great hatred , for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her . And Amnon said to her , Arise , be gone .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	16	And she said to him , There is no cause for this evil in sending me away , [ which ] is greater than the other that thou didst to me . But he would not hearken to her .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	17	Then he called his young man that attended upon him , and said , Put now this [ woman ] out from me , and bolt the door after her .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	18	Now she had a vest of many colours upon her ; for so were the king 's daughters that were virgins apparelled . And his attendant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	19	And Tamar put ashes on her head , and rent her vest of many colours which was on her , and laid her hand on her head , and went away , crying out as she went .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	20	And Absalom her brother said to her , Has Amnon thy brother been with thee ? and now , my sister , be still : he is thy brother ; take not this thing to heart . And Tamar remained , and [ that ] desolate , in her brother Absalom 's house .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	21	And king David heard of all these things , and he was very angry .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	22	And Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad ; for Absalom hated Amnon , because he had humbled his sister Tamar .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	23	And it came to pass after two full years , that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-Hazor , which is beside Ephraim ; and Absalom invited all the king 's sons .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	24	And Absalom came to the king , and said , Behold , now , thy servant has sheepshearers ; let the king , I pray thee , and his servants go with thy servant .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	25	And the king said to Absalom , No , my son , let us not all go , lest we be burdensome to thee . And he urged him , but he would not go ; and he blessed him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	26	And Absalom said , If not , I pray thee , let my brother Amnon go with us . And the king said to him , Why should he go with thee ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	27	But Absalom pressed him ; and he let Amnon and all the king 's sons go with him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	28	And Absalom commanded his servants , saying , Mark ye now when Amnon 's heart is merry with wine , and when I say to you , Smite Amnon ; then slay him , fear not : have not I commanded you ? be courageous , and be valiant .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	29	And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded . Then all the king 's sons arose , and they rode each upon his mule and fled .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	30	And it came to pass , while they were in the way , that tidings came to David , saying , Absalom has smitten all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	31	Then the king arose , and rent his garments , and lay on the earth ; and all his servants stood by with their garments rent .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	32	And Jonadab , the son of Shimeah David 's brother , answered and said , Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king 's sons ; for Amnon only is dead ; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he humbled his sister Tamar .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	33	And now let not my lord the king take the thing to heart , to say , All the king 's sons are dead ; for Amnon only is dead .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	34	And Absalom fled . And the young man that watched lifted up his eyes and looked , and behold , there came much people from the way behind him , from the hill-side .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	35	And Jonadab said to the king , Behold , the king 's sons come : as thy servant said , so it is .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	36	And as soon as he had ended speaking , behold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice and wept ; and the king also and all his servants wept very bitterly .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	37	And Absalom fled , and went to Talmai , the son of Ammihud , king of Geshur . And [ David ] mourned for his son every day .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	38	Now Absalom fled , and went to Geshur , and was there three years .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	13	39	And king David longed to go forth to Absalom ; for he was comforted concerning Amnon , seeing he was dead .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	2	And Joab sent to Tekoah , and fetched thence a wise woman , and said to her , I pray thee , feign thyself to be a mourner , and put on mourning garments , I pray , and anoint not thyself with oil , but be as a woman that hath a long time mourned for the dead ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	14	For we must needs die , and are as water spilt on the ground , which can not be gathered up again ; and God has not taken away his life , but devises means that the banished one be not expelled from him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	3	and come to the king , and speak after this manner to him . And Joab put the words into her mouth .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	4	And the woman of Tekoah spoke to the king , and she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance , and said , Save , O king !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	5	And the king said to her , What aileth thee ? And she said , I am indeed a widow woman , and my husband is dead .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	6	And thy bondmaid had two sons , and they two strove together in the field , and there was none to part them , but the one smote the other and slew him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	7	And behold , the whole family is risen against thy bondmaid , and they say , Deliver him that smote his brother , that we may put him to death , for the life of his brother whom he killed ; and we will destroy the heir also : so they will quench my coal which is left , and will not leave to my husband a name or remnant on the earth .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	8	And the king said to the woman , Go to thy house , and I will give charge concerning thee .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	9	And the woman of Tekoah said to the king , Upon me , my lord , O king , be the iniquity , and upon my father 's house ; and the king and his throne be guiltless .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	10	And the king said , Whoever speaks to thee , bring him to me , and he shall not touch thee any more .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	11	Then she said , I pray thee , let the king remember Jehovah thy God , that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more , lest they cut off my son . And he said , [ As ] Jehovah liveth , there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	12	And the woman said , Let thy bondmaid , I pray thee , speak a word to my lord the king . And he said , Speak .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	13	And the woman said , Why then hast thou thought such a thing against God 's people ? and the king in saying this thing , is as one guilty , in that the king does not bring back his banished one .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	15	And now that I am come to speak of this thing to my lord the king , it is because the people have made me afraid ; and thy bondmaid said , I will now speak to the king ; perhaps the king will perform the request of his handmaid .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	16	For the king will hear , to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	17	And thy bondmaid said , Let the word of my lord the king now be comfortable ; for as an angel of God , so is my lord the king to discern good and bad ; and Jehovah thy God will be with thee .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	18	And the king answered and said to the woman , Hide not from me , I pray thee , the thing that I shall ask thee . And the woman said , Let my lord the king now speak .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	19	And the king said , Is the hand of Joab with thee in all this ? And the woman answered and said , [ As ] thy soul liveth , my lord , O king , there is no turning to the right hand or to the left from aught that my lord the king has spoken ; for thy servant Joab , he bade me , and he put all these words into the mouth of thy bondmaid :
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	20	in order to turn the appearance of the thing has thy servant Joab done this thing ; but my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all that is in the earth .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	21	And the king said to Joab , Behold now , I have done this thing : so go , bring back the young man Absalom .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	22	And Joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself , and blessed the king ; and Joab said , To-day thy servant knows that I have found favour in thy sight , my lord , O king , in that the king has fulfilled the request of his servant .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	23	And Joab arose and went to Geshur , and brought Absalom to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	24	And the king said , Let him turn to his own house , and let him not see my face . And Absalom withdrew to his own house , and saw not the king 's face .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	25	But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	26	And when he shaved his head ( for it was at every year 's end that he shaved it , because it was heavy on him , therefore he shaved it ) , he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king 's weight .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	27	And to Absalom there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tamar : she was a woman of a beautiful countenance .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	28	So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem , and did not see the king 's face .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	29	Then Absalom sent for Joab , to send him to the king ; but he would not come to him ; and he sent again the second time , but he would not come .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	30	Then he said to his servants , See , Joab 's allotment is near mine and he has barley there : go and set it on fire . And Absalom 's servants set the allotment on fire .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	31	Then Joab arose , and came to Absalom to [ his ] house , and said to him , Why have thy servants set my allotment on fire ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	32	And Absalom said to Joab , Behold , I sent to thee , saying , Come hither , that I may send thee to the king , to say , Why am I come from Geshur ? it would have been better for me to be there still . And now let me see the king 's face ; and if there be iniquity in me , let him slay me .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	14	33	And Joab came to the king , and told him . And he called Absalom , and he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king ; and the king kissed Absalom .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	2	And Absalom rose early , and stood beside the way of the gate ; and it was so , that when any man who had a controversy had to come to the king for judgment , then Absalom called him , and said , Of what city art thou ? And he said , Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	15	And the king 's servants said to the king , Behold , thy servants [ will do ] whatever my lord the king shall choose .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	3	And Absalom said to him , See , thy matters are good and right ; but there is no man to hear thee [ appointed ] by the king .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	4	And Absalom said , Oh that I were made judge in the land , that every man who has any controversy and cause might come to me , and I would do him justice !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	5	And it was so , that when any man came near to do him obeisance , he put forth his hand , and took him , and kissed him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	6	And in this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment ; and Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	7	And it came to pass at the end of forty years , that Absalom said to the king , I pray thee , let me go and pay in Hebron my vow which I have vowed to Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	8	For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode in Geshur in Syria , saying , If Jehovah shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem , then I will serve Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	9	And the king said to him , Go in peace . And he rose up and went to Hebron .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	10	And Absalom sent emissaries into all the tribes of Israel , saying , When ye hear the sound of the trumpet , ye shall say , Absalom reigns in Hebron .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	11	And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem , that were invited ; and they went in their simplicity , and they knew nothing .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	12	And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite , David 's counsellor , from his city , from Giloh , while he offered the sacrifices . And the conspiracy gathered strength ; and the people increased continually with Absalom .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	13	And there came one to David who reported saying , The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	14	And David said to all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem , Rise up and let us flee ; for we shall not [ else ] escape from Absalom . Be quick to depart , lest he overtake us quickly , and bring evil upon us , and smite the city with the edge of the sword .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	16	And the king went forth , and all his household after him , and the king left ten women , concubines , to keep the house .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	17	And the king went forth , and all the people after him , and stayed at the remote house .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	18	And all his servants passed on beside him ; and all the Cherethites , and all the Pelethites , and all the Gittites , six hundred men that came after him from Gath , passed over before the king .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	19	And the king said to Ittai the Gittite , Why dost thou also go with us ? return to thy place , and abide with the king ; for thou art a foreigner , and besides , thou hast emigrated to the place where thou [ dwellest ] .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	20	Thou didst come yesterday , and should I this day make thee go up and down with us , seeing I go whither I can ? Return and take back thy brethren . Mercy and truth be with thee !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	21	And Ittai answered the king and said , [ As ] Jehovah liveth , and [ as ] my lord the king liveth , surely in what place my lord the king shall be , whether in death or life , even there also will thy servant be .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	22	And David said to Ittai , Go and pass over . And Ittai the Gittite passed over , and all his men , and all the little ones that were with him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	23	And all the country wept with a loud voice , and all the people passed over ; the king also himself passed over the torrent Kidron , and all the people passed over , towards the way of the wilderness .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	24	And behold , Zadok also , and all the Levites with him , bearing the ark of the covenant of God ; and they set down the ark of God ; and Abiathar went up , until all the people had passed completely out of the city .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	25	And the king said to Zadok , Carry back the ark of God into the city . If I shall find favour in the eyes of Jehovah , he will bring me again , and shew me it , and its habitation .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	26	But if he thus say , I have no delight in thee ; behold , [ here am ] I , let him do to me as seemeth good to him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	27	And the king said to Zadok the priest , Thou art the seer : return into the city in peace , and your two sons with you , Ahimaaz thy son , and Jonathan the son of Abiathar .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	28	See , I will stop in the plains of the desert , until there come word from you to inform me .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	29	And Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem ; and they abode there .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	30	But David went up by the ascent of the Olives , and wept as he went up , and had his head covered , and he went barefoot ; and all the people that was with him covered every man his head , and they went up , weeping as they went up .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	31	And one told David saying , Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom . Then said David , Jehovah , I pray thee , turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	32	And it came to pass , when David had come to the summit , where he worshipped God , that behold , Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent , and earth upon his head .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	33	And David said to him , If thou passest on with me , thou wilt be a burden to me ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	34	but if thou return to the city , and say to Absalom , I will be thy servant , O king ; as I have been thy father 's servant hitherto , so now will I be thy servant ; then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	35	And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests ? and it shall be , [ that ] whatsoever thing thou shalt hear out of the king 's house , thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	36	Behold , they have there with them their two sons , Ahimaaz Zadok 's [ son ] , and Jonathan Abiathar 's son ; and by them ye shall send to me everything that ye shall hear .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	15	37	And Hushai David 's friend came into the city , and Absalom came into Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	2	And the king said to Ziba , What meanest thou by these ? And Ziba said , The asses are for the king 's household to ride on ; and the bread and summer fruits for the young men to eat ; and the wine , that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	16	And it came to pass , when Hushai the Archite , David 's friend , came to Absalom , that Hushai said to Absalom , Long live the king ! Long live the king !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	3	And the king said , And where is thy master 's son ? And Ziba said to the king , Behold , he abides at Jerusalem ; for he said , To-day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	4	And the king said to Ziba , Behold , thine are all that pertained to Mephibosheth . And Ziba said , I humbly bow myself : may I find favour in thy sight , my lord , O king .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	5	And when king David came to Bahurim , behold , there came out from thence a man of the family of the house of Saul , whose name was Shimei , the son of Gera : he came forth , and cursed ,
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	6	and cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David ; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	7	And thus said Shimei as he cursed : Away , away , thou man of blood and man of Belial !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	8	Jehovah has returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul , in whose stead thou hast reigned ; and Jehovah has given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son ; and behold , thou art [ taken ] in thine own evil , for thou art a man of blood .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	9	And Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king , Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? let me go over , I pray thee , and take off his head .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	10	And the king said , What have I to do with you , ye sons of Zeruiah ? so let him curse , for Jehovah has said to him , Curse David ! Who shall then say , Why dost thou so ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	11	And David said to Abishai , and to all his servants , Behold , my son , who came forth of my bowels , seeks my life : how much more now a Benjaminite ? let him alone and let him curse ; for Jehovah has bidden him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	12	It may be that Jehovah will look on mine affliction , and that Jehovah will requite me good for my being cursed this day .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	13	And David and his men went by the way ; and Shimei went along on the hill 's side over against him , and cursed as he went , and threw stones at him , and cast dust .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	14	And the king , and all the people that were with him , came weary , and refreshed themselves there .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	15	Now Absalom , and all the people , the men of Israel , came to Jerusalem , and Ahithophel with him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	17	And Absalom said to Hushai , Is this thy kindness to thy friend ? why didst thou not go with thy friend ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	18	And Hushai said to Absalom , No ; but whom Jehovah , and this people , and all the men of Israel choose , his will I be , and with him will I abide .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	19	And again , whom should I serve ? should it not be in the presence of his son ? as I have served in thy father 's presence , so will I be in thy presence .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	20	And Absalom said to Ahithophel , Give counsel among you what we shall do .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	21	And Ahithophel said to Absalom , Go in to thy father 's concubines , whom he has left to keep the house ; and all Israel shall hear that thou art become odious with thy father ; and the hands of all that are with thee shall be strong .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	22	So they spread a tent for Absalom upon the roof ; and Absalom went in to his father 's concubines in the sight of all Israel .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	16	23	And the counsel of Ahithophel , which he counselled in those days , was as if a man had inquired of the word of God : so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	2	and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed , and will make him afraid ; and all the people that are with him shall flee ; and I will smite the king only ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	17	And Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel ; and the maid went and told them ; and they went and told king David , for they might not be seen to come into the city .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	3	and I will bring back all the people to thee . The man whom thou seekest is as if all returned : all the people shall be in peace .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	4	And the saying was right in the eyes of Absalom , and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	5	And Absalom said , Call now Hushai the Archite also , and we will hear also what he says .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	6	And Hushai came to Absalom , and Absalom spoke to him saying , Ahithophel has spoken after this manner : shall we carry out his word ? If not , speak thou .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	7	And Hushai said to Absalom , The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	8	And Hushai said , Thou knowest thy father and his men , that they are mighty men , and they are of exasperated spirit , as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field ; and thy father is a man of war , and will not lodge with the people .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	9	Behold , he is hid now in some pit , or some such place ; and it will come to pass , when some of them fall at the first , whoever heareth it will say , There has been slaughter among the people that follow Absalom ,
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	10	and even the valiant man whose heart is as the heart of a lion shall utterly melt ; for all Israel knows that thy father is a mighty man , and they that are with him are valiant men .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	11	But I counsel that all Israel be speedily gathered to thee , from Dan even to Beer-sheba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ; and that thou go to battle in thine own person .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	12	And we shall come upon him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light upon him as the dew falls on the ground ; and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	13	And if he withdraw into a city , then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city , and we will draw it into the torrent , until there be not one small stone found there .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	14	And Absalom and all the men of Israel said , The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel . And Jehovah had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel , in order that Jehovah might bring evil upon Absalom .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	15	And Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests , Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel ; and thus and thus have I counselled .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	16	And now send quickly , and tell David saying , Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness , but speedily pass over ; lest the king be swallowed up , and all the people that are with him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	18	But a lad saw them , and told Absalom . Then they went both of them away quickly , and came to the house of a man at Bahurim , who had a well in his court ; and they went down there .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	19	And the woman took and spread the covering over the well 's mouth , and spread ground corn on it ; and the thing was not known .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	20	And Absalom 's servants came to the woman to the house , and said , Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan ? And the woman said to them , They have gone over the brook of water . And they sought and could not find [ them ] , and returned to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	21	And it came to pass after they had departed , that they came up out of the well , and went and told king David ; and they said to David , Arise and pass quickly over the water ; for thus has Ahithophel counselled against you .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	22	Then David arose , and all the people that were with him , and they passed over the Jordan ; by the morning light there was not one of them missing that had not gone over the Jordan .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	23	And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed , he saddled his ass , and arose and went to his house , to his city , and gave charge to his household , and hanged himself , and he died ; and he was buried in the sepulchre of his father .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	24	And David came to Mahanaim . And Absalom passed over the Jordan , he and all the men of Israel with him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	25	And Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab ; which Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Jithra the Israelite , that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash , sister to Zeruiah , Joab 's mother .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	26	And Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	27	And as soon as David came to Mahanaim , Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lo-debar , and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim ,
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	28	brought beds , and basons , and earthen vessels , and wheat , and barley , and flour , and parched [ corn ] , and beans , and lentils , and parched [ pulse ] ,
DARBY	2%20Samuel	17	29	and honey , and cream , and sheep , and cheese of kine to David , and to the people that were with him , to eat ; for they said , The people is hungry , and weary , and thirsty in the wilderness .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	2	And David sent forth the people , a third part under the hand of Joab , and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah , Joab 's brother , and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite . And the king said to the people , I will surely go forth with you myself also .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	18	Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a monument , which is in the king 's dale ; for he said , I have no son to keep my name in remembrance ; and he called the monument after his own name ; and it is called unto this day , Absalom 's memorial .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	3	But the people said , Thou shalt not go forth , for if we should in any case flee , they will not care for us ; neither if half of us die , will they care for us ; for * thou * art worth ten thousand of us ; and now it is better that thou succour us out of the city .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	4	And the king said to them , I will do what is good in your sight . And the king stood by the gate-side , and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	5	And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai , saying , [ Deal ] gently for my sake with the young man Absalom . And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	6	And the people went out into the field against Israel ; and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	7	And the people of Israel were routed before the servants of David , and there was a great slaughter there that day : twenty thousand men .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	8	And the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country ; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	9	And Absalom found himself in the presence of David 's servants . And Absalom was riding upon a mule , and the mule went under the thick boughs of the great terebinth , and his head caught in the terebinth , and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth ; and the mule that was under him went away .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	10	And a man saw it , and told Joab , and said , Behold , I saw Absalom hanging in a terebinth .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	11	And Joab said to the man that told him , And behold , thou sawest [ him ] , and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground ? and I would have given thee ten silver pieces and a girdle .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	12	And the man said to Joab , Though I should receive a thousand silver pieces in my hand , yet would I not put forth my hand against the king 's son ; for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai , saying , Take care , whoever it be [ of you ] , of the young man Absalom .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	13	Or I should have acted falsely against mine own life , for there is no matter concealed from the king , and thou wouldest have set thyself against [ me ] .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	14	Then said Joab , I may not tarry thus with thee . And he took three spears in his hand , and thrust them into Absalom 's body , while he was yet alive in the midst of the terebinth .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	15	And ten young men that bore Joab 's armour surrounded and smote Absalom , and killed him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	16	And Joab blew the trumpet , and the people returned from pursuing after Israel ; for Joab kept back the people .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	17	And they took Absalom , and cast him into a great pit in the wood , and raised a very great heap of stones upon him . And all Israel fled every one to his tent .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	19	And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said , Let me run , I pray , and carry the king the news that Jehovah has avenged him of his enemies .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	20	And Joab said to him , Thou shalt not be a bearer of news to-day , but thou shalt carry the news another day ; but to-day thou shalt carry no news , because the king 's son is dead .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	21	Then said Joab to the Cushite , Go , tell the king what thou hast seen . And the Cushite bowed himself to Joab , and ran .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	22	And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said yet again to Joab , Come what may , let me , I pray thee , also run after the Cushite . And Joab said , Why wilt thou run , my son , seeing that there is no news suited [ to thee ] ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	23	—But , come what may , let me run . And he said to him , Run . And Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain , and outstripped the Cushite .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	24	And David sat between the two gates ; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate , on to the wall , and lifted up his eyes and looked , and behold , a man running alone .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	25	And the watchman cried , and told the king . And the king said , If he be alone , there is news in his mouth . And he came on and drew near .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	26	And the watchman saw another man running ; and the watchman called to the porter and said , Behold a man running alone . And the king said , He also is a bearer of news .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	27	And the watchman said , I see the running of the foremost like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok . And the king said , He is a good man ; and comes with good news .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	28	And Ahimaaz called and said to the king , Peace ! And he fell down to the earth on his face before the king , and said , Blessed be Jehovah thy God , who has delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	29	And the king said , Is it well with the young man Absalom ? And Ahimaaz said , I saw a great tumult when Joab sent the king 's servant , and me thy servant ; but I knew not what it was .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	30	And the king said , Turn aside [ and ] stand here . And he turned aside and stood still .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	31	And behold , the Cushite came ; and the Cushite said , Let my lord the king receive good tidings , for Jehovah has avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	32	And the king said to the Cushite , Is it well with the young man Absalom ? And the Cushite said , The enemies of my lord the king , and all that rise against thee for evil , be as that young man .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	18	33	And the king was much moved , and went up to the upper chamber of the gate , and wept ; and as he went , he said thus : O my son Absalom , my son , my son Absalom ! would God I had died in thy stead , O Absalom , my son , my son !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	2	And the victory that day was [ turned ] into mourning for all the people ; for the people heard say that day , The king is grieved for his son .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	19	And he said to the king , Let not my lord impute iniquity to me , neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem , that the king should take it to heart .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	3	And the people stole away that day into the city , as people steal away when ashamed of fleeing in battle .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	4	And the king covered his face , and the king cried with a loud voice , My son Absalom ! Absalom , my son , my son !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	5	And Joab came into the house to the king , and said , Thou hast put to shame this day the faces of all thy servants who have this day saved thy life , and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters , and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubines ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	6	in that thou lovest them that hate thee , and hatest those that love thee . For thou hast declared this day , that neither princes nor servants are anything to thee : for to-day I perceive , that if Absalom had lived , and all we had died to-day , then it would have been right in thine eyes .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	7	But now arise , go forth , and speak consolingly to thy servants ; for I swear by Jehovah , if thou go not forth , there will not tarry one with thee this night ; and that would be worse to thee than all the evil that has befallen thee from thy youth until now .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	8	Then the king arose , and sat in the gate . And they told all the people , saying , Behold , the king is sitting in the gate . And all the people came before the king . Now Israel had fled every man to his tent .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	9	And all the people were at strife throughout the tribes of Israel , saying , The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies , and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines ; and now he is fled out of the land because of Absalom .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	10	And Absalom , whom we anointed over us , is dead in battle ; and now why are ye silent as to bringing the king back ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	11	And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests , saying , Speak to the elders of Judah saying , Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house ? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king , to his house .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	12	Ye are my brethren , ye are my bone and my flesh ; and why will ye be the last to bring back the king ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	13	And say to Amasa , Art thou not my bone and my flesh ? God do so to me and more also , if thou be not captain of the host before me continually instead of Joab .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	14	And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah as of one man ; and they sent to the king , Return , thou and all thy servants .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	15	And the king returned and came as far as the Jordan . And Judah came to Gilgal , to go to meet the king , to conduct the king over the Jordan .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	16	And Shimei the son of Gera , the Benjaminite , who was of Bahurim , hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	17	And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they forded the Jordan before the king .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	18	And a ferry boat passed to and fro to carry over the king 's household , and to do what he thought good . And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was [ just ] crossing over the Jordan .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	20	For thy servant knows that I have sinned ; and behold , I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	21	And Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said , Should not Shimei be put to death for this , because he cursed Jehovah 's anointed ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	22	And David said , What have I to do with you , ye sons of Zeruiah , that ye should this day be adversaries to me ? Should there any man be put to death this day in Israel ? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	23	And the king said to Shimei , Thou shalt not die . And the king swore to him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	24	And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king . Now he had neither washed his feet , nor trimmed his beard , nor washed his clothes , from the day the king departed until the day he came [ again ] in peace .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	25	And as soon as Jerusalem came to meet the king , the king said to him , Why didst thou not go with me , Mephibosheth ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	26	And he said , My lord , O king , my servant deceived me ; for thy servant said , I will saddle me the ass , and ride thereon , and go with the king ; for thy servant is lame .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	27	And he has slandered thy servant to my lord the king ; but my lord the king is as an angel of God ; do therefore what is good in thy sight .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	28	For all my father 's house were but dead men before my lord the king ; and thou didst set thy servant among them that eat at thine own table . What further right therefore have I ? and for what should I cry any more to the king ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	29	And the king said to him , Why speakest thou any more of thy matters ? I have said , Thou and Ziba divide the land .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	30	And Mephibosheth said to the king , Let him even take all , since my lord the king is come again in peace to his own house .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	31	And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim , and went over the Jordan with the king , to conduct him over the Jordan .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	32	And Barzillai was very aged , eighty years old ; and it was he that had maintained the king while he abode at Mahanaim ; for he was a very great man .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	33	And the king said to Barzillai , Pass thou over with me , and I will maintain thee with me in Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	34	And Barzillai said to the king , How many are the days of the years of my life , that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	35	I am this day eighty years old : can I discern between good and bad ? can thy servant taste what I eat and what I drink ? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women ? and why should thy servant be yet a burden to my lord the king ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	36	Thy servant will go a little way over the Jordan with the king ; and why should the king recompense it to me with this reward ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	37	Let thy servant , I pray thee , turn back again , that I may die in mine own city , by the grave of my father and of my mother . But behold thy servant Chimham : let him go over with my lord the king ; and do to him what seems good to thee .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	38	And the king said , Chimham shall go over with me , and I will do to him that which seems good to thee ; and whatsoever thou shalt require of me , that will I do for thee .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	39	And all the people went over the Jordan ; and the king went over ; and the king kissed Barzillai , and blessed him ; and he returned to his own place .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	40	And the king went on to Gilgal , and Chimham went on with him ; and all the people of Judah conducted the king , and also half the people of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	41	And behold , all the men of Israel came to the king , and said to the king , Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away , and have brought the king , and his household , and all David 's men with him , over the Jordan ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	42	And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel , Because the king is near of kin to me ; and why then are ye angry for this matter ? have we eaten anything which came from the king , or has he given us any present ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	19	43	And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said , I have ten parts in the king and I have also more right in David than thou ; and why didst thou slight me ? and was not my advice the first , to bring back my king ? And the words of the men of Judah were harsher than the words of the men of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	2	Then all the men of Israel went up from after David , following Sheba the son of Bichri . But the men of Judah clave to their king , from the Jordan even to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	20	And Joab answered and said , Far be it , far be it from me , that I should swallow up or destroy .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	3	And David came to his house at Jerusalem ; and the king took the ten women , concubines , whom he had left to keep the house , and put them in a house of confinement and maintained them , but did not go in to them . So they were shut up unto the day of their death , living in widowhood .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	4	And the king said to Amasa , Call me the men of Judah together within three days , and do thou attend here .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	5	So Amasa went to call together [ the men of ] Judah ; but he delayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	6	And David said to Abishai , Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom . Take thou thy lord 's servants , and pursue after him , lest he get him fortified cities and escape our sight .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	7	And there went out after him Joab 's men , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , and all the mighty men ; and they went out of Jerusalem , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	8	When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon , Amasa came before them . And Joab was girded with his coat , his dress , and upon it was the girdle of the sword which was fastened on his loins in its sheath ; and as he went forth it fell out .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	9	And Joab said to Amasa , Art thou well , my brother ? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	10	And Amasa had taken no notice of the sword that was in Joab 's hand : so he smote him with it in the belly and shed out his bowels to the ground , and struck him not again ; and he died . And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	11	And one of Joab 's young men stood by [ Amasa ] and said , He that favours Joab , and he that is for David , let him follow Joab .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	12	Now Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway . And when the man saw that all the people stood still , he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field , and cast a cloth upon him , when he saw that every one that came by stood still .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	13	When he was removed out of the highway , all the people went on after Joab , to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri ,
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	14	who went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel , and to Beth-Maacah , and all the Berim ; and they gathered together , and went also after him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	15	And they came and besieged him in Abel-Beth-Maacah , and they cast up a bank against the city , and it was raised in the trench ; and all the people that were with Joab sapped the wall , to throw it down .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	16	And a wise woman cried out of the city , Hear , hear : say , I pray you , unto Joab , Come near hither , that I may speak with thee .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	17	And he came near to her ; and the woman said , Art thou Joab ? And he said , I [ am he ] . And she said to him , Listen to the words of thy handmaid . And he said , I am listening .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	18	And she spoke saying , They were wont to speak in old time saying , Just inquire in Abel ; and so they ended .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	19	I am peaceable [ and ] faithful in Israel : thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel . Why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	21	The matter is not so ; but a man of mount Ephraim , Sheba the son of Bichri by name , has lifted up his hand against the king , against David : give up him only , and I will depart from the city . And the woman said to Joab , Behold , his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	22	Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom . And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri , and cast it to Joab . And he blew a trumpet , and they dispersed from the city , every man to his tent . And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	23	And Joab was over all the host of Israel ; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	24	and Adoram was over the levy ; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	25	and Sheva was scribe ; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	20	26	and Ira also , the Jairite , was David 's chief ruler .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	2	And the king called the Gibeonites , and spoke to them . ( Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel , but of the remainder of the Amorites ; and the children of Israel had sworn to them ; and Saul sought to smite them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah . )
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	21	And he defied Israel ; but Jonathan the son of Shimea David 's brother smote him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	3	And David said to the Gibeonites , What shall I do for you ? and with what shall I make atonement , that ye may bless the inheritance of Jehovah ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	4	And the Gibeonites said to him , As to Saul and his house , it is with us no question of receiving silver or gold , neither is it for us to have any man put to death in Israel . And he said , What ye say will I do for you .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	5	And they said to the king , The man that consumed us , and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in all the borders of Israel ,
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	6	let seven men of his sons be given up to us , and we will hang them up to Jehovah in Gibeah of Saul , the chosen of Jehovah . And the king said , I will give [ them ] .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	7	But the king spared Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan the son of Saul , because of Jehovah 's oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	8	And the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , whom she had borne to Saul , Armoni and Mephibosheth ; and the five sons of [ the sister of ] Michal the daughter of Saul , whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	9	and he gave them into the hands of the Gibeonites , and they hanged them on the hill before Jehovah . And they fell all seven together , and were put to death in the first days of the harvest , in the beginning of barley harvest .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	10	Then Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth , and spread it for her upon the rock , from the beginning of harvest until water poured on them out of the heavens , and suffered neither the fowl of the heavens to rest on them by day , nor the beasts of the field by night .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	11	And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , the concubine of Saul , had done .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	12	And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-Gilead , who had stolen them from the open place of Beth-shan , where the Philistines had hanged them , the day the Philistines had smitten Saul in Gilboa ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	13	and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son ; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	14	And they buried [ them ] with the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela , in the sepulchre of Kish his father ; and they did all that the king had commanded . And afterwards God was propitious to the land .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	15	And the Philistines had yet war again with Israel ; and David went down , and his servants with him , and fought with the Philistines . And David was exhausted .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	16	And Ishbibenob , who was of the children of Raphah—the weight of his lance was three hundred shekels of bronze , and he was girded with new [ armour ] —thought to smite David .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	17	And Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him , and smote the Philistine and killed him . Then the men of David swore to him , saying , Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle , that thou quench not the lamp of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	18	And it came to pass after this , that there was again a battle with the Philistines , at Gob ; then Sibbechai the Hushathite smote Saph , who was of the children of Raphah .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	19	And there was again a battle at Gob with the Philistines ; and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim , a Bethlehemite , smote Goliath the Gittite ; now the shaft of his spear was like a weaver 's beam .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	20	And there was again a battle , at Gath ; and there was a man [ there ] of great stature , that had on each hand six fingers , and on each foot six toes , four and twenty in number ; and he also was born to Raphah .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	21	22	These four were born to Raphah , in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	2	And he said , Jehovah is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	22	For I have kept the ways of Jehovah , And have not wickedly departed from my God .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	3	God is my rock , in him will I trust—My shield , and the horn of my salvation , My high tower , and my refuge , My saviour : thou wilt save me from violence .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	4	I will call upon Jehovah , who is to be praised ; So shall I be saved from mine enemies .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	5	For the waves of death encompassed me , Torrents of Belial made me afraid .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	6	The bands of Sheol surrounded me ; The cords of death encountered me ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	7	In my distress I called upon Jehovah , And I cried to my God ; And he heard my voice out of his temple , And my cry [ came ] into his ears .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	8	Then the earth shook , and quaked ; The foundations of the heavens trembled And shook because he was wroth .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	9	There went up a smoke out of his nostrils , And fire out of his mouth devoured : Coals burned forth from it .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	10	And he bowed the heavens , and came down ; And darkness was under his feet .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	11	And he rode upon a cherub , and did fly ; And he was seen upon the wings of the wind .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	12	And he made darkness round about him a tent , Gatherings of waters , thick clouds of the skies .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	13	From the brightness before him Burned forth coals of fire .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	14	Jehovah thundered from the heavens , And the Most High uttered his voice .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	15	And he sent arrows , and scattered [ mine enemies ] ; Lightning , and discomfited them .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	16	And the beds of the sea were seen , The foundations of the world were uncovered At the rebuke of Jehovah , At the blast of the breath of his nostrils .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	17	He reached forth from above , he took me , He drew me out of great waters ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	18	He delivered me from my strong enemy , From them that hated me ; For they were mightier than I .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	19	They encountered me in the day of my calamity ; But Jehovah was my stay .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	20	And he brought me forth into a large place ; He delivered me , because he delighted in me .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	21	Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness , According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	23	For all his ordinances were before me , And his statutes , I did not depart from them ,
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	24	And I was upright before him , And kept myself from mine iniquity .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	25	And Jehovah hath recompensed me according to my righteousness , According to my cleanness in his sight .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	26	With the gracious thou dost shew thyself gracious ; With the upright man thou dost shew thyself upright ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	27	With the pure thou dost shew thyself pure ; And with the perverse thou dost shew thyself contrary .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	28	And the afflicted people thou dost save ; And thine eyes are upon the haughty , [ whom ] thou bringest down .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	29	For thou art my lamp , Jehovah ; And Jehovah enlighteneth my darkness .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	30	For by thee I have run through a troop ; By my God have I leaped over a wall .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	31	As for God , his way is perfect ; The word of Jehovah is tried : He is a shield to all that trust in him .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	32	For who is God , save Jehovah ? And who is a rock , save our God ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	33	God is my strong fortress , And he maketh my way perfectly smooth .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	34	He maketh my feet like hinds ' [ feet ] , And setteth me upon my high places .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	35	He teacheth my hands to war , And mine arms bend a bow of brass .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	36	And thou didst give me the shield of thy salvation , And thy condescending gentleness hath made me great .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	37	Thou enlargedst my steps under me ; And mine ankles did not slip .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	38	I pursued mine enemies , and destroyed them , And I turned not again till they were consumed .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	39	And I have consumed them and have crushed them , and they rose not again ; Yea , they fell under my feet .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	40	And thou girdedst me with strength to battle : Thou didst subdue under me those that rose up against me .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	41	And mine enemies didst thou make to turn their backs unto me , And those that hated me I destroyed .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	42	They looked , and there was none to save—Unto Jehovah , and he answered them not .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	43	And I did beat them small as the dust of the earth , I trod them as the mire of the streets ; I stamped upon them .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	44	And thou hast delivered me from the strivings of my people , Thou hast kept me to be head of the nations : A people I knew not doth serve me :
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	45	Strangers come cringing unto me : At the hearing of the ear , they obey me .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	46	Strangers have faded away , And they come trembling forth from their close places .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	47	Jehovah liveth ; and blessed be my rock ; And exalted be the God , the rock of my salvation ,
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	48	The God who hath avenged me , And hath brought the peoples under me .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	49	He brought me forth from mine enemies : Yea , thou hast lifted me up above them that rose up against me ; From the man of violence hast thou delivered me .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	50	Therefore will I give thanks to thee , Jehovah , among the nations , And will sing psalms to thy name .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	22	51	[ It is he ] who giveth great deliverances to his king , And sheweth loving-kindness to his anointed , To David , and to his seed for evermore .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	2	The Spirit of Jehovah spoke by me , And his word was on my tongue .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	23	He was honoured above the thirty , but he did not attain to the [ first ] three . And David set him in his council .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	3	The God of Israel said , The Rock of Israel spoke to me , The ruler among men shall be just , Ruling in the fear of God ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	4	And [ he shall be ] as the light or the morning , [ like ] the rising of the sun , A morning without clouds ; [ When ] from the sunshine , after rain , The green grass springeth from the earth .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	5	Although my house be not so before God , Yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant , Ordered in every way and sure ; For [ this is ] all my salvation , and every desire , Although he make [ it ] not to grow .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	6	But [ the sons ] of Belial [ are ] all of them as thorns thrust away , Because they can not be taken with hands ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	7	And the man that will touch them provideth himself with iron and the staff of a spear ; And they shall be utterly burned with fire in [ their ] place .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	8	These are the names of the mighty men whom David had : Joseb-Bassebeth , Tachkemonite the chief of the captains : he was Adino the Eznite ; he [ fought ] against eight hundred , slain [ by him ] at one time .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	9	And after him , Eleazar the son of Dodo the son of an Ahohite : he was one of the three mighty men with David , when they had defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle , and the men of Israel were gone up .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	10	He arose and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary , and his hand clave to the sword ; and Jehovah wrought a great deliverance that day ; and the people returned after him only to spoil .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	11	And after him , Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite : the Philistines were gathered into a troop , and there was there a plot of ground full of lentils , and the people had fled before the Philistines ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	12	and he stood in the midst of the plot and delivered it , and smote the Philistines , and Jehovah wrought a great deliverance .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	13	And three of the thirty chiefs went down , and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam , when the troop of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	14	And David was then in the stronghold ; and the Philistines ' garrison was then at Bethlehem .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	15	And David longed , and said , Oh that one would give me to drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem , which is in the gate !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	16	And the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , which is in the gate , and took it , and brought it to David ; however he would not drink of it , but poured it out to Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	17	And he said , Be it far from me , Jehovah , that I should do this thing ! is it not the blood of the men that went at the risk of their lives ? Therefore he would not drink it . These things did the three mighty men .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	18	And Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was the chief of three ; and he brandished his spear against three hundred and slew them ; and he had a name among the three .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	19	Was he not most honourable of three ? and he was their captain ; but he did not attain to the [ first ] three .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	20	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , son of a valiant man , great in exploits , of Kabzeel : he it was that smote two lions of Moab ; and he went down and smote a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	23	21	He also smote the Egyptian , an imposing man : and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand ; and he went down to him with a staff , and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian 's hand , and slew him with his own spear .

DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	24	And the king said to Araunah , No ; but I will in any case buy [ them ] of thee at a price : neither will I offer up to Jehovah my God burnt-offerings without cost . And David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	3	And Joab said to the king , May Jehovah thy God even add to the people , how many soever they be , a hundredfold , and that the eyes of my lord the king may see [ it ] ; but why does my lord the king delight in this thing ?
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	4	But the king 's word prevailed against Joab , and against the captains of the army . And Joab and the captains of the army went out from the presence of the king to count the people of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	5	And they passed over the Jordan , and encamped in Aroer , on the right side of the city that is in the midst of the ravine of Gad , and toward Jaazer .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	6	And they came to Gilead , and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi ; and came to Dan-jaan , and to the environs of Sidon ;
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	7	and they came to the fortified city of Tyre , and to all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites ; and went out to the south of Judah , to Beer-sheba .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	8	And they went through all the land , and came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	9	And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to the king ; and there were of Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew sword ; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	10	And David 's heart smote him after he had numbered the people . And David said to Jehovah , I have sinned greatly in what I have done ; and now , I beseech thee , Jehovah , put away the iniquity of thy servant ; for I have done very foolishly .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	11	And when David arose in the morning , the word of Jehovah came to the prophet Gad , David 's seer , saying ,
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	12	Go and say to David , Thus saith Jehovah : I impose on thee three [ things ] ; choose one of them that I may do it unto thee .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	13	And Gad came to David , and told him , and said to him , Shall seven years of famine come to thee in thy land ? or wilt thou flee three months before thine adversaries while they pursue thee ? or shall there be three days ' pestilence in thy land ? Now be aware and consider what word I shall bring again to him that sent me .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	14	And David said to Gad , I am in a great strait : let us fall , I pray thee , into the hand of Jehovah ; for his mercies are great ; but let me not fall into the hand of man .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	15	And Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the set time ; and there died of the people from Dan even to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	16	And the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it ; but Jehovah repented him of the evil , and said to the angel that destroyed among the people , It is enough : withdraw now thine hand . And the angel of Jehovah was by the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	17	And David spoke to Jehovah when he saw the angel that smote among the people , and said , Behold , it is I that have sinned , and it is I that have committed iniquity ; but these sheep , what have they done ? let thy hand , I pray thee , be on me , and on my father 's house !
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	18	And Gad came that day to David , and said to him , Go up , rear an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	19	And David , according to the saying of Gad , went up as Jehovah had commanded .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	20	And Araunah looked , and saw the king and his servants coming on towards him ; and Araunah went out , and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	21	And Araunah said , Why is my lord the king come to his servant ? And David said , To buy the threshing-floor of thee , to build an altar to Jehovah , that the plague may be stayed from the people .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	22	And Araunah said to David , Let my lord the king take and offer up that which is good in his sight : see , [ here are ] oxen for the burnt-offering , and the threshing-sledges and implements of the oxen for wood .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	23	All these things , O king , doth Araunah give to the king . And Araunah said to the king , Jehovah thy God accept thee .
DARBY	2%20Samuel	24	25	And David built there an altar to Jehovah , and offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings . And Jehovah was propitious to the land , and the plague was stayed from Israel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	1	And king David was old [ and ] advanced in age ; and they covered him with clothes , but he obtained no warmth .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	2	And his servants said to him , Let there be found for my lord the king a young virgin ; and let her stand before the king , and let her cherish him , and let her lie in thy bosom , that my lord the king may get warm .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	3	And they sought for a fair damsel throughout the territory of Israel , and found Abishag a Shunammite , and brought her to the king .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	4	And the damsel was very fair ; and cherished the king , and ministered to him ; but the king knew her not .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	5	And Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself , saying , I will be king ; and he provided himself chariots and horsemen , and fifty men to run before him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	6	And his father had not grieved him at any time in saying , Why doest thou so ? and he was also a very comely man ; and [ his mother ] bore him after Absalom .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	7	And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah , and with Abiathar the priest ; and they helped Adonijah and followed [ him ] .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	8	But Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men whom David had , were not with Adonijah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	9	And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fatted cattle by the stone of Zoheleth , which is by En-rogel , and invited all his brethren , the king 's sons , and all the men of Judah , the king 's servants ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	10	but Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah , and the mighty men , and Solomon his brother , he did not invite .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	11	And Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon , saying , Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith is king , and David our lord does not know [ it ] ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	12	And now , come , let me , I pray thee , give thee counsel , that thou mayest save thine own life , and the life of thy son Solomon .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	13	Go and get thee in to king David , and say to him , Didst not thou , my lord , O king , swear to thy handmaid saying , Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne ? why then does Adonijah reign ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	14	Behold , while thou yet talkest there with the king , I also will come in after thee and confirm thy words .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	15	And Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber ; and the king was very old ; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered to the king .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	16	And Bathsheba bowed and did obeisance to the king . And the king said , What wouldest thou ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	17	And she said to him , My lord , thou hast sworn by Jehovah thy God to thy handmaid , [ saying , ] Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	18	And now behold , Adonijah is king ; and now , my lord the king , thou knowest it not .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	19	And he has sacrificed oxen and fatted cattle and sheep in abundance , and has invited all the sons of the king and Abiathar the priest and Joab the captain of the host ; but Solomon thy servant has he not invited .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	20	And thou , my lord the king , the eyes of all Israel are upon thee , that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	21	Otherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	22	And behold , while she yet talked with the king , Nathan the prophet also came in .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	23	And they told the king saying , Behold , Nathan the prophet . And when he was come in before the king , he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	24	And Nathan said , My lord , O king , hast thou said , Adonijah shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	25	For he is gone down this day , and has sacrificed oxen and fatted cattle and sheep in abundance , and has invited all the king 's sons , and the captains of the host , and Abiathar the priest ; and behold , they eat and drink before him , and say , God save king Adonijah !
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	26	But me , [ even ] me thy servant , and Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and thy servant Solomon , he has not invited .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	27	Is this thing done by my lord the king , and thou hast not shewn to thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	28	Then king David answered and said , Call me Bathsheba . And she came into the king 's presence , and stood before the king .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	29	And the king swore , and said , [ As ] Jehovah liveth , who has redeemed my soul out of all distress ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	30	even as I swore to thee by Jehovah the God of Israel , saying , Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne in my stead ; even so will I certainly do this day .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	31	And Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth , and did reverence to the king , and said , Let my lord king David live for ever .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	32	And king David said , Call me Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada . And they came before the king .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	33	And the king said to them , Take with you the servants of your lord , and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule , and bring him down to Gihon ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	34	and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel ; and blow ye with the trumpet , and say , Long live king Solomon !
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	35	And ye shall come up after him , that he may come and sit on my throne ; for he shall reign in my stead , and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	36	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said , Amen : Jehovah , the God of my lord the king , say so too .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	37	As Jehovah has been with my lord the king , even so be he with Solomon , and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	38	And Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down , and caused Solomon to ride upon king David 's mule , and brought him to Gihon .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	39	And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the tabernacle , and anointed Solomon . And they blew the trumpet ; and all the people said , Long live king Solomon !
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	40	And all the people came up after him , and the people piped with pipes , and rejoiced with great joy , so that the earth rent with the sound of them .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	41	And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard [ it ] as they were finishing their repast ; and Joab heard the sound of the trumpet , and he said , Wherefore this noise of the city in an uproar ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	42	While he yet spoke , behold , Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came ; and Adonijah said [ to him ] , Come in ; for thou art a valiant man , and bringest good news .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	43	And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah , Indeed , our lord king David has made Solomon king .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	44	And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites and the Pelethites , and they have caused him to ride upon the king 's mule ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	45	and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon ; and they are come up from thence rejoicing , so that the city is in an uproar . This is the noise which ye have heard .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	46	And also Solomon is sitting on the throne of the kingdom .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	47	And moreover the king 's servants came to bless our lord king David , saying , Thy God make the name of Solomon more excellent than thy name , and make his throne greater than thy throne ! And the king bowed himself on the bed .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	48	And also thus said the king : Blessed be Jehovah , the God of Israel , who has given one to sit on my throne this day , mine eyes even seeing it .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	49	And all Adonijah 's guests were afraid , and rose up and went every man his way .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	50	And Adonijah feared because of Solomon , and arose and went and caught hold of the horns of the altar .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	51	And it was told Solomon saying , Behold , Adonijah fears king Solomon ; for behold , he has caught hold of the horns of the altar , saying , Let king Solomon swear to me this day that he will not put his servant to death with the sword .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	52	And Solomon said , If he be a worthy man , there shall not one of his hairs fall to the earth ; but if wickedness be found in him , he shall die .
DARBY	1%20Kings	1	53	And king Solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar . And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon ; and Solomon said to him , Go to thy house .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	2	I go the way of all the earth : be of good courage therefore , and be a man ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	3	and keep the charge of Jehovah thy God , to walk in his ways , to keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his ordinances , and his testimonies , as it is written in the law of Moses , that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyself ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	4	that Jehovah may confirm his word which he spoke concerning me , saying , If thy sons take heed to their way , to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul , there shall not fail thee , said he , a man upon the throne of Israel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	5	And thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me , what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel , to Abner the son of Ner , and to Amasa the son of Jether , whom he slew , and shed the blood of war in peace , and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins , and upon his sandals that were on his feet .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	6	And thou shalt do according to thy wisdom , and not let his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	7	But shew kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite , and let them be of those that eat at thy table ; for so they came up to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	8	And behold , there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera , the Benjaminite of Bahurim , who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day that I went to Mahanaim ; but he came down to meet me at the Jordan , and I swore to him by Jehovah saying , I will not put thee to death with the sword .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	9	And now hold him not guiltless ; for thou art a wise man , and thou shalt know what thou oughtest to do to him ; but bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	10	And David slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	11	And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years : he reigned seven years in Hebron , and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	12	And Solomon sat on the throne of David his father ; and his kingdom was established greatly .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	13	And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon . And she said , Comest thou peaceably ? And he said , Peaceably .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	14	And he said , I have something to say to thee . And she said , Speak .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	15	And he said , Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine , and all Israel had set their faces on me that I should reign ; but the kingdom is turned about and is become my brother 's , for it was his from Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	16	And now I ask one petition of thee ; refuse me not . And she said to him , Speak .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	17	And he said , Speak , I pray thee , to Solomon the king—for he will not refuse thee—that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	18	And Bathsheba said , Well , I will speak for thee to the king .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	19	And Bathsheba went to king Solomon , to speak to him for Adonijah . And the king rose up to meet her , and bowed himself to her , and sat down on his throne ; and he caused a throne to be set for the king 's mother , and she sat on his right hand .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	20	Then she said , I desire one small petition of thee ; refuse me not . And the king said to her , Ask , my mother , for I will not refuse thee .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	21	And she said , Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother as wife .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	22	And king Solomon answered and said to his mother , And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah ? ask for him the kingdom also ; for he is mine elder brother ; even for him , and for Abiathar the priest , and for Joab the son of Zeruiah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	23	And king Solomon swore by Jehovah saying , God do so to me , and more also , —Adonijah has spoken this word against his own life !
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	24	And now [ as ] Jehovah liveth , who has established me , and set me on the throne of David my father , and who has made me a house , as he promised , Adonijah shall be put to death this day .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	25	And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; who fell on him , that he died .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	26	And the king said to Abiathar the priest , Go to Anathoth , to thine own fields ; for thou art worthy of death ; but I will not at this time put thee to death , because thou didst bear the ark of Adonai Jehovah before David my father , and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	27	And Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Jehovah , to fulfil the word of Jehovah , which he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	28	And the report came to Joab ( for Joab had turned after Adonijah , though he had not turned after Absalom ) ; and Joab fled to the tent of Jehovah , and caught hold of the horns of the altar .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	29	And it was told king Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of Jehovah ; and behold , he is by the altar . And Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , saying , Go , fall on him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	30	And Benaiah came to the tent of Jehovah and said to him , Thus saith the king : Come forth . And he said , No ; for I will die here . And Benaiah brought the king word again , saying , Thus said Joab , and thus he answered me .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	31	And the king said to him , Do as he has said , and fall upon him , and bury him ; and take away the innocent blood , which Joab shed , from me and from the house of my father .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	32	And Jehovah shall requite the blood which he shed upon his own head , because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he , and slew them with the sword , without my father David 's knowledge : Abner the son of Ner , captain of the host of Israel , and Amasa the son of Jether , captain of the host of Judah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	33	And their blood shall be requited upon the head of Joab , and upon the head of his seed for ever ; but upon David , and upon his seed , and upon his house , and upon his throne , shall there be peace for ever from Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	34	And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell upon him , and put him to death ; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	35	And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his stead over the host ; and Zadok the priest the king put in the stead of Abiathar .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	36	And the king sent and called for Shimei , and said to him , Build thee a house in Jerusalem , and abide there , and go not forth thence anywhere .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	37	And it shall be that on the day thou goest forth , and passest over the torrent of Kidron , … know for certain that thou shalt surely die : thy blood shall be upon thine own head .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	38	And Shimei said to the king , The saying is good : as my lord the king has said , so will thy servant do . And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	39	And it came to pass at the end of three years , that two servants of Shimei 's ran away to Achish son of Maachah , king of Gath . And they told Shimei saying , Behold , thy servants are in Gath .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	40	Then Shimei arose , and saddled his ass , and went to Gath , to Achish , to seek his servants ; and Shimei went , and brought his servants from Gath .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	41	And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath , and had come again .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	42	And the king sent and called for Shimei , and said to him , Did I not make thee swear by Jehovah , and protest to thee , saying , Know for certain , that on the day thou goest forth , and walkest abroad anywhere , thou shalt surely die ? and thou saidst to me , The word that I have heard is good .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	43	Why then hast thou not kept the oath of Jehovah , and the commandment that I charged thee with ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	44	And the king said to Shimei , Thou knowest all the wickedness of which thy heart is conscious , which thou didst to David my father ; and Jehovah returns thy wickedness upon thine own head ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	45	and king Solomon shall be blessed , and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah for ever .
DARBY	1%20Kings	2	46	And the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada ; who went out and fell upon him , and he died . And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	3	And Solomon loved Jehovah , walking in the statutes of David his father ; only , he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	2	Only , the people sacrificed on the high places ; for there was no house built to the name of Jehovah , until those days .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	4	And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there ; for that was the great high place : a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer up upon that altar .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	5	In Gibeon Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream by night ; and God said , Ask what I shall give thee .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	6	And Solomon said , Thou hast shewn unto thy servant David my father great loving-kindness , according as he walked before thee in truth , and in righteousness , and in uprightness of heart with thee ; and thou hast kept for him this great loving-kindness , that thou hast given him a son who sits upon his throne , as it is this day .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	7	And now , Jehovah my God , thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father ; and I am but a little child : I know not to go out and to come in .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	8	And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen , a great people , that can not be numbered nor counted for multitude .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	9	Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart , to judge thy people , to discern between good and bad ; for who is able to judge this thy numerous people ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	10	And the word pleased the Lord , that Solomon had asked this thing .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	11	And God said to him , Because thou hast asked this thing , and hast not asked for thyself long life , neither hast asked riches for thyself , nor hast asked the life of thine enemies , but hast asked for thyself discernment to understand judgment ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	12	behold , I have done according to thy word : behold , I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart , so that there hath been none like unto thee before thee , neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	13	And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked , both riches and glory ; so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	14	And if thou wilt walk in my ways , to keep my statutes and my commandments , as thy father David did walk , then I will prolong thy days .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	15	And Solomon awoke , and behold , it was a dream . And he came to Jerusalem , and stood before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah , and offered up burnt-offerings , and offered peace-offerings , and made a feast to all his servants .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	16	Then came two women , harlots , to the king , and stood before him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	17	And the first woman said , Ah , my lord ! I and this woman abode in one house ; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	18	And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered , that this woman was delivered also ; and we were together ; no stranger was with us in the house , only we two were in the house .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	19	And this woman 's child died in the night ; because she had lain upon it .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	20	And she arose at midnight , and took my son from beside me , while thy handmaid slept , and laid it in her bosom , and laid her dead son in my bosom .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	21	And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck , behold , it was dead ; and I considered it in the morning , and behold , it was not my son , whom I bore .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	22	And the other woman said , No , for the living is my son , and the dead is thy son . And this one said , No , but the dead is thy son , and the living is my son . Thus they spoke before the king .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	23	Then said the king , The one says , This that is living is my son , and thy son is the dead ; and the other says , No , for thy son is the dead , and my son is the living .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	24	And the king said , Bring me a sword . And they brought a sword before the king .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	25	And the king said , Divide the living child in two , and give half to the one , and half to the other .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	26	Then spoke the woman whose was the living child to the king , for her bowels yearned over her son , and she said , Ah , my lord ! give her the living child , and in no wise put it to death . But the other said , Let it be neither mine nor thine ; divide it .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	27	And the king answered and said , Give this one the living child , and in no wise put it to death : she is its mother .
DARBY	1%20Kings	3	28	And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged ; and they feared the king , for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him , to do justice .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	4	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host ; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	2	And these are the princes whom he had : Azariah the son of Zadok was priest ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	3	Elihoreph and Ahiah , the sons of Shisha , scribes ; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud , chronicler ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	5	and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the superintendents ; and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer , the king 's friend ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	6	and Ahishar was over the household ; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the levy-service .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	7	And Solomon had twelve superintendents over all Israel ; and they provided food for the king and his household : each man his month in the year had to make provision .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	8	And these are their names : Ben-Hur , in mount Ephraim .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	9	Ben-Deker in Makaz , and in Shaalbim , and Beth-shemesh , and Elon-Beth-hanan .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	10	Ben-Hesed , in Arubboth ; he had Sochoh , and all the land of Hepher .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	11	Ben-Abinadab had all the upland of Dor ; Taphath the daughter of Solomon was his wife .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	12	Baana the son of Ahilud had Taanach and Megiddo , and all Beth-shean , which is by Zaretan beneath Jizreel , from Beth-shean to Abel-Meholah , as far as beyond Jokneam .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	13	Ben-Geber , in Ramoth-Gilead ; he had the villages of Jair the son of Manasseh , which are in Gilead ; he had the region of Argob , which is in Bashan , sixty great cities with walls and bars of bronze .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	14	Ahinadab the son of Iddo , at Mahanaim .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	15	Ahimaaz , in Nephtali ; he also took Basmath the daughter of Solomon as wife .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	16	Baanah the son of Hushai , in Asher and in Aloth .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	17	Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah , in Issachar .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	18	Shimei the son of Ela , in Benjamin .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	19	Geber the son of Uri , in the land of Gilead , the land of Sihon the king of the Amorites , and of Og the king of Bashan ; and [ he was ] the only superintendent that was in the land .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	20	Judah and Israel were many , as the sand which is by the sea in multitude , eating and drinking and making merry .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	21	And Solomon ruled over all kingdoms from the river to the land of the Philistines , and as far as the border of Egypt : they brought presents , and served Solomon all the days of his life .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	22	And Solomon 's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour , and sixty measures of meal ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	23	ten fatted oxen , and twenty oxen out of the pastures , and a hundred sheep , besides harts , and gazelles , and fallow-deer , and fatted fowl .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	24	For he had dominion over all on this side the river , from Tiphsah as far as Gazah , over all the kings on this side the river ; and he had peace on all sides round about .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	25	And Judah and Israel dwelt safely , every man under his vine and under his fig-tree , from Dan even to Beer-sheba , all the days of Solomon .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	26	And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	27	And those officers provided food for king Solomon , and for all who came to king Solomon 's table , every man in his month : they let nothing be wanting .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	28	And the barley , and the straw for the horses and coursers , they brought to the place where [ the superintendents ] were , every man according to his charge .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	29	And God gave Solomon wisdom and very great understanding and largeness of heart , even as the sand that is on the sea-shore .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	30	And Solomon 's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the sons of the east , and all the wisdom of Egypt .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	31	For he was wiser than all men ; than Ethan the Ezrahite , and Heman , and Calcol , and Darda , the sons of Mahol ; and his fame was in all the nations round about .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	32	And he spoke three thousand proverbs ; and his songs were a thousand and five .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	33	And he spoke of the trees , from the cedar-tree that is on Lebanon even to the hyssop that springs out of the wall ; he spoke also of cattle , and of fowls , and of creeping things , and of fishes .
DARBY	1%20Kings	4	34	And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon , from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom .
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	5	And behold , I purpose to build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God , as Jehovah spoke to David my father saying , Thy son , whom I will set upon thy throne in thy stead , he shall build a house unto my name .
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	2	And Solomon sent to Hiram , saying ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	3	Thou knowest that David my father could not build a house unto the name of Jehovah his God , because of the wars which were about him on every side , until Jehovah put them under the soles of his feet .
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	4	But now Jehovah my God has given me rest on every side : there is neither adversary nor evil event .
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	6	And now command that they hew me cedar-trees out of Lebanon ; and my servants shall be with thy servants ; and I will give thee hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt say ; for thou knowest that there is not among us any that are experienced in cutting timber like to the Zidonians .
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	7	And it came to pass when Hiram heard the words of Solomon , that he rejoiced greatly , and said , Blessed be Jehovah this day , who has given to David a wise son over this great people .
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	8	And Hiram sent to Solomon , saying , I have heard the things which thou sentest to me for : I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar , and concerning timber of cypress .
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	9	My servants shall bring [ them ] down from Lebanon to the sea ; and I will convey them by sea [ in ] rafts to the place that thou shalt appoint me , and will cause them to be broken up there , and thou shalt receive them . And thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for my household .
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	10	So Hiram gave Solomon cedar-trees and cypress-trees [ according to ] all his desire .
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	11	And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat as food for his household , and twenty measures of beaten oil : thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year .
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	12	And Jehovah gave Solomon wisdom as he promised him . And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon ; and they two made a league .
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	13	And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel ; and the levy was thirty thousand men .
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	14	And he sent them to Lebanon , ten thousand a month by courses ; a month they were in Lebanon , two months at home ; and Adoniram was over the levy .
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	15	And Solomon had seventy thousand that bore burdens , and eighty thousand stone-masons in the mountains ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	16	besides the overseers whom Solomon had set over the work , three thousand three hundred , who ruled over the people that wrought in the work .
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	17	And the king commanded , and they brought great stones , costly stones , hewn stones , to lay the foundation of the house .
DARBY	1%20Kings	5	18	And Solomon 's builders and Hiram 's builders and the Giblites hewed them , and prepared timber and stones to build the house .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	6	The lowest floor was five cubits broad , and the middle one was six cubits broad , and the third was seven cubits broad ; for in the [ thickness of the wall of ] the house he made resets round about outside , that nothing should be fastened in the walls of the house .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	2	And the house that king Solomon built for Jehovah was sixty cubits in length , and twenty in breadth , and thirty cubits in height .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	3	And the porch , in front of the temple of the house , was twenty cubits in length , in front of the house broadways , [ and ] ten cubits was its breadth , in front of the house .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	4	And for the house he made closed windows with fixed lattices .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	5	And against the wall of the house he built floors round about , [ against ] the walls of the house , round about the temple and the oracle ; and he made side-chambers round about .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	7	And the house , when it was being built , was built of stone entirely made ready before it was brought thither ; so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was being built .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	8	The entrance to the side-chambers of the middle [ floor ] was in the right side of the house ; and they went up by winding stairs into the middle [ floor ] , and out of the middle into the third .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	9	And he built the house , and finished it ; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	10	And he built the floors against all the house , five cubits high ; and they held to the house by the timbers of cedar .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	11	And the word of Jehovah came to Solomon saying ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	12	As to this house which thou art building , if thou wilt walk in my statutes , and practise mine ordinances , and keep all my commandments to walk in them , then will I perform my word as to thee which I spoke unto David thy father ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	13	and I will dwell among the children of Israel , and will not forsake my people Israel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	14	And Solomon built the house and finished it .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	15	And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar , from the floor of the house to the walls of the roof ; he overlaid [ them ] on the inside with wood , and overlaid the floor of the house with boards of cypress .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	16	And he built twenty cubits of the innermost part of the house , both floor and walls , with boards of cedar ; and he built [ them ] for it within , to [ be ] the oracle , the most holy place .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	17	And the house , that is , the temple before it , was forty cubits [ long ] .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	18	And the cedar of the house within was carved with colocynths and half-open flowers : all was cedar ; there was no stone seen .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	19	And he prepared the oracle in the midst of the house within , to set there the ark of the covenant of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	20	And the oracle within was twenty cubits in length , and twenty cubits in breadth , and twenty cubits in the height thereof ; and he overlaid it with pure gold ; and he overlaid the cedar-wood altar—
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	21	and Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold , and shut off the oracle in front with chains of gold , and overlaid it with gold .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	22	And the whole house he overlaid with gold , the whole house entirely ; also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	23	And he made in the oracle two cherubim of olive-wood , ten cubits high ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	24	and one wing of the cherub was five cubits , and five cubits the other wing of the cherub , ten cubits from the end of one wing to the end of the other wing ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	25	and the other cherub was ten cubits : both the cherubim were of one measure and one form .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	26	The height of the one cherub was ten cubits , and so of the other cherub .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	27	And he set the cherubim in the midst of the inner house ; and the wings of the cherubim were stretched forth , so that the wing of the one touched the wall , and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall ; and their wings touched , wing to wing , in the midst of the house .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	28	And he overlaid the cherubim with gold .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	29	And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved sculptures of cherubim , and palm-trees , and half-open flowers , within and without .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	30	And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold , within and without .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	31	And for the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive-wood : the lintel [ and ] side posts were the fifth part [ of the breadth of the house ] .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	32	The two doors were of olive-wood ; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim , and palm-trees and half-open flowers , and overlaid them with gold , and spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm-trees .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	33	And he also made for the doorway of the temple posts of olive-wood , of the fourth part [ of the breadth of the house ] .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	34	And the two folding-doors were of cypress-wood : the two leaves of the one door were folding , and the two leaves of the other door were folding .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	35	And he carved on them cherubim , and palm-trees , and half-open flowers ; and overlaid them with gold fitted on the carved work .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	36	And he built the inner court of three rows of hewn stone , and a row of cedar-beams .
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	37	In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of Jehovah laid , in the month Zif ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	6	38	and in the eleventh year , in the month Bul , which is the eighth month , was the house finished in all its parts , and according to all the fashion of it . So he was seven years in building it .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	7	And he made the porch for the throne where he judged , the porch of judgment ; and it was covered with cedar from floor to floor .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	2	And he built the house of the forest of Lebanon ; its length was a hundred cubits , and its breadth fifty cubits , and its height thirty cubits , upon four rows of cedar-pillars , with cedar-beams upon the pillars ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	3	and it was covered with cedar above upon the side-chambers , which were on forty-five pillars , fifteen in a row .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	4	And there were cross-beams in three rows , and window was against window in three ranks .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	5	And all the doors and posts were square , with an architrave ; and window was against window in three ranks .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	6	And he made the porch of pillars ; its length was fifty cubits , and its breadth thirty cubits ; and there was a porch in front of them ; and there were pillars , and steps in front of them .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	8	And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch , which was of the like work . And he made , like to this porch , a house for Pharaoh 's daughter , whom Solomon had taken .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	9	All these [ buildings ] were of costly stones , hewn stones , according to the measures , sawed with saws , within and without , even from the foundation to the coping , and on the outside as far as the great court .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	10	And the foundations were of costly stones , great stones , stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	11	And above were costly stones , hewn stones , according to the measures , and cedar .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	12	And the great court round about had three rows of hewn stones , and a row of cedar-beams ; and so it was for the inner court of the house of Jehovah , and the porch of the house .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	13	And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	14	He was a widow 's son of the tribe of Naphtali , and his father was a man of Tyre , a worker in brass ; and he was full of wisdom and understanding and knowledge , to do all kinds of works in brass . And he came to king Solomon , and made all his work .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	15	And he formed the two pillars of brass ; the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits , and a line of twelve cubits encompassed the second pillar .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	16	And he made two capitals of molten brass , to set upon the tops of the pillars ; the height of the one capital was five cubits , and the height of the other capital was five cubits ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	17	[ and ] nets of checker-work , wreaths of chain-work , for the capitals which were upon the top of the pillars ; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	18	And he made pomegranates , namely two rows round about upon the one network , to cover the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars ; and so he did for the other capital .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	19	And the capitals that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily-work [ as ] in the porch , four cubits .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	20	And the capitals upon the two pillars , above also , close to the enlargement which was behind the network , had two hundred pomegranates in rows round about , [ also ] on the other capital .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	21	And he set up the pillars for the porch of the temple ; and he set up the right pillar , and called its name Jachin ; and he set up the left pillar , and called its name Boaz .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	22	And upon the top of the pillars was lily-work ; and the work of the pillars was finished .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	23	And he made the sea , molten , ten cubits from brim to brim , round all about ; and its height was five cubits ; and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it round about .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	24	And under the brim of it round about there were colocynths , encompassing it , ten in a cubit enclosing the sea round about ; two rows of colocynths , cast when it was cast .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	25	It stood upon twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east ; and the sea was above upon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	26	And its thickness was a hand-breadth , and its brim was like the work of the brim of a cup , with lily-blossoms ; it held two thousand baths .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	27	And he made ten bases of brass : four cubits was the length of one base , and the breadth four cubits , and the height three cubits .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	28	And the work of the bases was this : they had panels , and the panels were between the fillets .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	29	And on the panels that were between the fillets were lions , oxen and cherubim ; and over the fillets there was a base above ; and beneath the lions and oxen were garlands of festoon-work .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	30	And every base had four wheels of brass , and axles of brass ; and on its four corners were shoulder-pieces : under the laver were shoulder-pieces molten , behind every garland .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	31	And the mouth of it within the crown and above was a cubit ; and its mouth was rounded , [ as ] the work of the base , a cubit and a half ; and also upon its mouth was sculpture ; but their panels were square , not round .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	32	And the four wheels were under the panels ; and the supports of the wheels were in the base ; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	33	And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel : their supports , and their rims , and their spokes and their naves were all molten .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	34	And there were four shoulder-pieces to the four corners of one base ; of the base itself were its shoulder-pieces .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	35	And in the top of the base there was a circular elevation of half a cubit round about ; and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	36	And he engraved on the plates of its stays and on its panels cherubim , lions and palm-trees , according to the space upon each ; and garlands were round about .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	37	After this [ manner ] he made the ten bases : all of them had one casting , one measure , one form .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	38	And he made ten lavers of brass : one laver contained forty baths ; every laver was four cubits ; upon every one of the ten bases one laver .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	39	And he put the bases , five on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house ; and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward , over against the south .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	40	And Hiram made the lavers , and the shovels , and the bowls . So Hiram ended doing all the work that he made for king Solomon [ for ] the house of Jehovah :
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	41	two pillars , and the globes of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars , two ; and the two networks , to cover the two globes of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	42	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks , two rows of pomegranates for one network , to cover the two globes of the capitals which were upon the pillars ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	43	and the ten bases , and the ten lavers on the bases ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	44	and one sea , and the twelve oxen under the sea ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	45	and the pots , and the shovels , and the bowls . And all these things , which Hiram made king Solomon for the house of Jehovah , were of bright brass .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	46	In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them , in the clay-ground between Succoth and Zaretan .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	47	And Solomon left all the vessels [ unweighed ] from their exceeding number ; the weight of the brass was not ascertained .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	48	And Solomon made all the vessels that were [ in ] the house of Jehovah : the golden altar ; and the table of gold , whereon was the shewbread ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	49	and the candlesticks of pure gold , five on the right , and five on the left , before the oracle ; and the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs of gold ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	50	and the basons , and the knives , and the bowls , and the cups , and the censers of pure gold ; and the hinges of gold , for the folding-doors of the inner house , the most holy place , [ and ] for the doors of the house , of the temple .
DARBY	1%20Kings	7	51	And all the work was finished that king Solomon made for the house of Jehovah . And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated ; the silver and the gold and the vessels he put among the treasures of the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	8	And the staves were long , so that the ends of the staves were seen from the holy place before the oracle , but they were not seen without . And there they are to this day .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	2	And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim , that is , the seventh month .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	3	And all the elders of Israel came ; and the priests took up the ark .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	4	And they brought up the ark of Jehovah , and the tent of meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the tent : the priests and the Levites brought them up .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	5	And king Solomon , and all the assembly of Israel that were assembled to him , [ who were ] with him before the ark , sacrificed sheep and oxen , which could not be counted nor numbered for multitude .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	6	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place , into the oracle of the house , into the most holy place , under the wings of the cherubim ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	7	for the cherubim stretched forth [ their ] wings over the place of the ark , and the cherubim covered the ark and its staves above .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	9	There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which Moses placed there at Horeb , when Jehovah made [ a covenant ] with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	10	And it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place , that the cloud filled the house of Jehovah ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	11	and the priests could not stand to do their service because of the cloud ; for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	12	Then said Solomon : Jehovah said that he would dwell in the thick darkness .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	13	I have indeed built a house of habitation for thee , a settled place for thee to abide in for ever .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	14	And the king turned his face , and blessed the whole congregation of Israel ; and the whole congregation of Israel stood .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	15	And he said : Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel , who spoke with his mouth unto David my father , and hath with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	16	Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt , I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in , that my name might be there ; but I have chosen David to be over my people Israel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	17	And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house unto the name of Jehovah the God of Israel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	18	But Jehovah said to David my father , Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house unto my name , thou didst well that it was in thy heart ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	19	nevertheless thou shalt not build the house ; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins , he shall build the house unto my name .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	20	And Jehovah has performed his word which he spoke ; and I am risen up in the room of David my father , and sit on the throne of Israel , as Jehovah promised , and I have built the house unto the name of Jehovah the God of Israel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	21	And I have set there a place for the ark , wherein is the covenant of Jehovah , which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	22	And Solomon stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of the whole congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward the heavens .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	23	And he said , Jehovah , God of Israel ! there is no God like thee , in the heavens above , or on the earth beneath , who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	24	who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him ; thou spokest with thy mouth , and hast fulfilled [ it ] with thy hand , as at this day .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	25	And now , Jehovah , God of Israel , keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him , saying , There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel , if only thy sons take heed to their way , to walk before me as thou hast walked before me .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	26	And now , O God of Israel , let thy words , I pray thee , be verified , which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David my father .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	27	But will God indeed dwell on the earth ? Behold , the heavens , and the heaven of heavens , can not contain thee ; how much less this house which I have built !
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	28	Yet have respect unto the prayer of thy servant , and to his supplication , Jehovah , my God , to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee this day ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	29	that thine eyes may be open upon this house night and day , upon the place of which thou hast said , My name shall be there : to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	30	And hearken unto the supplication of thy servant , and of thy people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place , and hear thou in thy dwelling-place , in the heavens , and when thou hearest , forgive .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	31	If a man have sinned against his neighbour , and an oath be laid upon him to adjure him , and the oath come before thine altar in this house ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	32	then hear thou in the heavens , and do , and judge thy servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way upon his own head ; and justifying the righteous , giving him according to his righteousness .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	33	When thy people Israel are put to the worse before the enemy , because they have sinned against thee , and shall turn again to thee , and confess thy name , and pray , and make supplication unto thee in this house ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	34	then hear thou in the heavens , and forgive the sin of thy people Israel , and bring them again unto the land that thou gavest unto their fathers .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	35	When the heavens are shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against thee ; if they pray toward this place , and confess thy name , and turn from their sin , because thou hast afflicted them ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	36	then hear thou in the heavens , and forgive the sin of thy servants , and of thy people Israel , when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk ; and give rain upon thy land , which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	37	If there be famine in the land , if there be pestilence , if there be blight , mildew , locust , caterpillar ; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their gates ; whatever plague , whatever sickness there be :
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	38	what prayer , what supplication soever be made by any man , of all thy people Israel , when they shall know every man the plague of his own heart , and shall spread forth his hands toward this house ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	39	then hear thou in the heavens , the settled place of thy dwelling , and forgive , and do , and render unto every man according to all his ways , whose heart thou knowest ( for thou , thou only , knowest the hearts of all the children of men ) ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	40	that they may fear thee all the days that they live upon the land which thou gavest unto our fathers .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	41	And as to the stranger also , who is not of thy people Israel , but cometh out of a far country for thy name 's sake
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	42	( for they shall hear of thy great name , and of thy mighty hand , and of thy stretched-out arm ) ; when he shall come and pray toward this house ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	43	hear thou in the heavens thy dwelling-place , and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for ; in order that all peoples of the earth may know thy name , [ and ] that they may fear thee as do thy people Israel ; and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	44	If thy people go out to battle against their enemy , by the way that thou shalt send them , and they pray to Jehovah toward the city that thou hast chosen , and the house that I have built unto thy name ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	45	then hear thou in the heavens their prayer and their supplication , and maintain their right .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	46	If they have sinned against thee , ( for there is no man that sinneth not , ) and thou be angry with them , and give them up to the enemy , and they have carried them away captives unto the enemy 's land , far or near ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	47	and if they shall take it to heart in the land whither they were carried captive , and repent , and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captive , saying , We have sinned , and have done iniquity , we have dealt perversely ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	48	and if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul , in the land of their enemies who led them away captive , and pray unto thee toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers , the city that thou hast chosen , and the house that I have built unto thy name ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	49	then hear thou in the heavens , the settled place of thy dwelling , their prayer and their supplication , and maintain their right ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	50	and forgive thy people their sin against thee , and all their transgressions whereby they have transgressed against thee , and give them to find compassion with those who carried them captive , that they may have compassion on them
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	51	( for they are thy people , and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt , from the midst of the furnace of iron ) —
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	52	thine eyes being open unto the supplication of thy servant , and unto the supplication of thy people Israel , to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	53	For thou hast separated them from among all peoples of the earth , to be thine inheritance , as thou spokest through Moses thy servant , when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt , O Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	54	And it was so , that when Solomon had ended praying all this prayer and supplication to Jehovah , he arose from before the altar of Jehovah , from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread forth to the heavens ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	55	and he stood and blessed the whole congregation of Israel with a loud voice , saying ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	56	Blessed be Jehovah , who has given rest to his people Israel , according to all that he promised : there has not failed one word of all his good promises which he spoke through Moses his servant !
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	57	Jehovah our God be with us , as he was with our fathers ; let him not forsake us nor cast us off :
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	58	that he may incline our hearts to him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances , which he commanded our fathers .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	59	And let these my words , with which I have made supplication before Jehovah , be nigh to Jehovah our God day and night , that he maintain the right of his servant , and the right of his people Israel , as the matter of each day shall require ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	60	that all peoples of the earth may know that Jehovah is God , that there is none else ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	61	and that your heart may be perfect with Jehovah our God , to walk in his statutes and to keep his commandments , as at this day .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	62	And the king , and all Israel with him , offered sacrifices before Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	63	And Solomon sacrificed a sacrifice of peace-offerings , which he sacrificed to Jehovah , twenty-two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep . So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	64	The same day the king hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah ; for there he offered the burnt-offerings , and the oblations , and the fat of the peace-offerings , because the brazen altar that was before Jehovah was too small to receive the burnt-offerings , and the oblations , and the fat of the peace-offerings .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	65	And at that time Solomon held the feast , and all Israel with him , a great congregation , from the entrance of Hamath unto the torrent of Egypt , before Jehovah our God , seven days and seven days , fourteen days .
DARBY	1%20Kings	8	66	On the eighth day he sent the people away ; and they blessed the king , and went to their tents , joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Jehovah had done to David his servant , and to Israel his people .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	9	And they shall say , Because they forsook Jehovah their God , who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt , and have attached themselves to other gods , and have worshipped them and served them ; therefore has Jehovah brought upon them all this evil .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	2	that Jehovah appeared to Solomon the second time , as he had appeared to him at Gibeon .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	3	And Jehovah said to him , I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication which thou hast made before me : I have hallowed this house , which thou hast built , to put my name there for ever ; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	4	And [ as for ] thee , if thou wilt walk before me , as David thy father walked , in integrity of heart , and in uprightness , to do according to all that I have commanded thee , [ and ] wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	5	then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom over Israel for ever , as I promised to David thy father , saying , There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	6	[ But ] if ye shall at all turn from following me , ye or your children , and will not keep my commandments , my statutes which I have set before you , but go and serve other gods , and worship them ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	7	then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and the house , which I have hallowed to my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a proverb and a by word among all peoples ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	8	and this house , [ which ] is high , every one that passes by it shall be astonished at , and shall hiss , and they shall say , Why has Jehovah done thus to this land and to this house ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	10	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years , when Solomon had built the two houses , the house of Jehovah and the king 's house ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	11	Hiram the king of Tyre having furnished Solomon with cedar-trees and cypress-trees , and with gold , according to all his desire , —that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	12	And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him ; and they did not please him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	13	And he said , What cities are these which thou hast given me , my brother ? And he called them the land of Cabul to this day .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	14	And Hiram had sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	15	And this is the account of the levy which king Solomon raised , to build the house of Jehovah , and his own house , and Millo , and the wall of Jerusalem , and Hazor , and Megiddo , and Gezer .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	16	—Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer , and burned it with fire , and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city , and given it as a dowry to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	17	—And Solomon built Gezer , and lower Beth-horon ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	18	and Baalath , and Tadmor in the wilderness , in the land ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	19	and all the store-cities that Solomon had , and cities for chariots , and cities for the horsemen , and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem , and on Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	20	All the people that were left of the Amorites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of the children of Israel ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	21	their children that were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy , upon them did Solomon impose a tribute of bondservice until this day .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	22	But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen ; but they were men of war , and his servants , and his chiefs , and his captains , and captains of his chariots , and his horsemen .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	23	These were the chief superintendents that were over Solomon 's work , five hundred and fifty , that ruled over the people that wrought in the work .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	24	But Pharaoh 's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which he had built for her : then he built Millo .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	25	And three times in the year did Solomon offer up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar that he had built to Jehovah , and he burned incense upon that which was before Jehovah . So he finished the house .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	26	And king Solomon made a fleet of ships in Ezion-Geber , which is beside Eloth , on the shore of the Red Sea , in the land of Edom .
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	27	And Hiram sent in the fleet his servants , shipmen that had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	9	28	and they went to Ophir , and fetched thence gold , four hundred and twenty talents , and brought it to king Solomon .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	10	And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold , and spices in very great abundance , and precious stones : there came no more such abundance of spices as those which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	2	And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train , with camels that bore spices and gold in very great abundance , and precious stones ; and she came to Solomon , and spoke to him of all that was in her heart .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	3	And Solomon explained to her all she spoke of : there was not a thing hidden from the king that he did not explain to her .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	4	And when the queen of Sheba saw all Solomon 's wisdom , and the house that he had built ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	5	and the food of his table , and the deportment of his servants , and the order of service of his attendants , and their apparel , and his cupbearers , and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Jehovah , there was no more spirit in her .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	6	And she said to the king , It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine affairs , and of thy wisdom ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	7	but I gave no credit to the words , until I came and mine eyes had seen ; and behold , the half was not told me : in wisdom and prosperity thou exceedest the report that I heard .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	8	Happy are thy men ! happy are these thy servants , who stand continually before thee , who hear thy wisdom !
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	9	Blessed be Jehovah thy God , who delighted in thee , to set thee on the throne of Israel ! Because Jehovah loves Israel for ever , therefore did he make thee king , to do judgment and justice .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	11	( And the fleet also of Hiram , which carried gold from Ophir , brought from Ophir sandal-wood in very great abundance , and precious stones .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	12	And the king made of the sandal-wood a balustrade for the house of Jehovah , and for the king 's house , and harps and lutes for the singers . There came no such sandal-wood , nor was there seen to this day . )
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	13	And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire , whatever she asked , besides what he gave her of the bounty of king Solomon . And she turned and went to her own land , she and her servants .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	14	And the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	15	besides what [ came ] by the dealers , and by the traffic of the merchants , and by all the kings of Arabia , and by the governors of the country .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	16	And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold , —he applied six hundred [ shekels ] of gold to one target ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	17	and three hundred shields of beaten gold , —he applied three minas of gold to one shield ; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	18	And the king made a great throne of ivory , and overlaid it with refined gold :
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	19	the throne had six steps , and the top of the throne was rounded behind ; and there were arms on each side at the place of the seat , and two lions stood beside the arms ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	20	and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps : there was not the like made in any kingdom .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	21	And all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of precious gold : none were of silver , [ which ] was not of the least account in the days of Solomon .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	22	For the king had on the sea a Tarshish-fleet , with the fleet of Hiram : once in three years came the Tarshish-fleet , bringing gold and silver , ivory , and apes , and peacocks .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	23	And king Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	24	And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	25	And they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and clothing , and armour , and spices , horses and mules , a rate year by year .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	26	And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen ; and he had a thousand four hundred chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen ; and he placed them in the chariot-cities , and with the king at Jerusalem .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	27	And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones , and cedars made he as the sycamores that are in the lowland for abundance .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	28	And the exportation of horses that Solomon had was from Egypt : a caravan of the king 's merchants fetched a drove [ of horses ] , at a price .
DARBY	1%20Kings	10	29	And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred [ shekels ] of silver , and a horse for a hundred and fifty ; and so they brought [ them ] by their means , for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	11	And Jehovah said to Solomon , Forasmuch as this is done by thee , and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which I commanded thee , I will certainly rend the kingdom from thee , and will give it to thy servant :
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	2	of the nations of which Jehovah had said to the children of Israel , Ye shall not go in to them , neither shall they come in to you ; they would certainly turn away your heart after their gods : to these Solomon was attached in love .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	3	And he had seven hundred wives , princesses , and three hundred concubines ; and his wives turned away his heart .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	4	And it came to pass when Solomon was old , [ that ] his wives turned away his heart after other gods ; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God , as the heart of David his father .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	5	And Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians , and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	6	And Solomon did evil in the sight of Jehovah , and followed not fully Jehovah , as David his father .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	7	Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites , on the hill that is before Jerusalem , and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	8	And so he did for all his foreign wives , who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	9	And Jehovah was angry with Solomon , because his heart was turned away from Jehovah the God of Israel , who had appeared to him twice ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	10	and had commanded him concerning this thing , not to go after other gods ; but he kept not what Jehovah had commanded .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	12	notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it , for David thy father 's sake ; I will rend it out of the hand of thy son ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	13	only , I will not rend away all the kingdom : I will give one tribe to thy son , for David my servant 's sake , and for Jerusalem 's sake which I have chosen .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	14	And Jehovah stirred up an adversary to Solomon , Hadad the Edomite ; he was of the king 's seed in Edom .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	15	Now it came to pass when David was in Edom , when Joab the captain of the host had gone up to bury the slain , after he had smitten every male in Edom
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	16	( for Joab abode there six months with all Israel , until he had cut off every male in Edom ) ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	17	that Hadad fled , he and certain Edomites of his father 's servants with him , to go into Egypt , Hadad being yet a little child .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	18	And they arose out of Midian , and came to Paran , and took men with them out of Paran , and they came to Egypt , to Pharaoh king of Egypt ; who gave him a house , and appointed him victuals , and gave him land .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	19	And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh , and he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tahpenes the queen .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	20	And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son ; and Tahpenes brought him up in Pharaoh 's house ; and Genubath was in Pharaoh 's household , among the sons of Pharaoh .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	21	And Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Joab the captain of the host was dead ; and Hadad said to Pharaoh , Let me depart , that I may go to mine own country .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	22	And Pharaoh said to him , What then dost thou lack with me , that behold , thou desirest to go to thine own country ? And he said , Nothing ; but in any case let me depart .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	23	God stirred him up yet an adversary , Rezon the son of Eliada , who had fled from Hadadezer king of Zobah , his lord .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	24	And he collected men to him , and became captain of a band , when David slew them [ of Zobah ] ; and they went to Damascus , and dwelt there , and reigned in Damascus .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	25	And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon , besides the mischief that Hadad [ did ] ; and he abhorred Israel , and reigned over Syria .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	26	And Jeroboam the son of Nebat , an Ephrathite of Zeredah , Solomon 's servant ( whose mother 's name was Zeruah , a widow woman ) , even he lifted up his hand against the king .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	27	And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king : Solomon was building Millo , and closing the breach of the city of David his father ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	28	and the man Jeroboam was strong and valiant ; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious , and he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	29	And it came to pass at that time that Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem , and the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way ; and he had clad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	30	Then Ahijah seized the new garment that was on him , and rent it in twelve pieces ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	31	and said to Jeroboam , Take thee ten pieces ; for thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel : Behold , I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give ten tribes to thee ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	32	but one tribe shall he have for my servant David 's sake , and for Jerusalem 's sake , the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel :
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	33	because they have forsaken me , and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians , Chemosh the god of the Moabites , and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon , and have not walked in my ways , to do that which is right in my sight , and my statutes and mine ordinances , as David his father .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	34	But I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand ; for I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant 's sake , whom I chose , who kept my commandments and my statutes ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	35	but I will take the kingdom out of his son 's hand , and will give it unto thee , —the ten tribes .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	36	And unto his son will I give one tribe , that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem , the city that I have chosen for myself to put my name there .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	37	And I will take thee , that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth , and thou shalt be king over Israel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	38	And it shall be , if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee , and wilt walk in my ways , and do that which is right in my sight , in keeping my statutes and my commandments , as David my servant did , that I will be with thee , and build thee a lasting house , as I built for David , and will give Israel unto thee .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	39	And I will for this afflict the seed of David , but not for ever .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	40	And Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam ; and Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt , to Shishak king of Egypt ; and he was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	41	And the rest of the acts of Solomon , and all that he did , and his wisdom , are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	42	And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years .
DARBY	1%20Kings	11	43	And Solomon slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David his father ; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	12	And Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day , as the king had appointed saying , Come again to me on the third day .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	2	And it came to pass when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it ( now he was yet in Egypt , whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	3	and they sent and called him ) , that Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam , saying ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	4	Thy father made our yoke grievous ; and now lighten thou the grievous servitude of thy father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us , and we will serve thee .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	5	And he said to them , Depart yet for three days , then come again to me . And the people departed .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	6	And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , How do ye advise to return answer to this people ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	7	And they spoke to him saying , If this day thou wilt be a servant to this people , and wilt serve them and answer them and speak good words to them , they will be thy servants for ever .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	8	But he forsook the advice of the old men which they had given him , and consulted with the young men , who had grown up with him , that stood before him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	9	And he said to them , What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people who have spoken to me saying , Lighten the yoke which thy father put upon us ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	10	And the young men that had grown up with him spoke to him saying , Thus shalt thou say to this people that have spoken to thee saying , Thy father made our yoke heavy , and lighten thou it for us , —thus shalt thou say to them : My little [ finger ] is thicker than my father 's loins ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	11	and whereas my father laid a heavy yoke upon you , * I * will add to your yoke : my father chastised you with whips , but * I * will chastise you with scorpions .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	13	And the king answered the people roughly , and forsook the advice of the old men which they had given him ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	14	and he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men , saying , My father made your yoke heavy , but * I * will add to your yoke : my father chastised you with whips , but * I * will chastise you with scorpions .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	15	So the king hearkened not to the people ; for it was brought about by Jehovah , that he might give effect to his word , which Jehovah spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	16	And all Israel saw that the king hearkened not to them ; and the people answered the king saying , What portion have we in David ? And [ we have ] no inheritance in the son of Jesse : To your tents , O Israel ! Now see to thine own house , David ! And Israel went to their tents .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	17	But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	18	And king Rehoboam sent Adoram , who was over the levy ; but all Israel stoned him with stones , that he died . And king Rehoboam hastened to mount his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	19	And Israel rebelled against the house of David , unto this day .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	20	And it came to pass when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come back , that they sent and called him to the assembly , and made him king over all Israel : none followed the house of David , but the tribe of Judah only .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	21	And Rehoboam came to Jerusalem ; and he assembled all the house of Judah , with the tribe of Benjamin , a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men apt for war , to fight against the house of Israel , that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	22	But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God , saying ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	23	Speak unto Rehoboam , the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin , and to the remainder of the people , saying ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	24	Thus saith Jehovah : Go not up , nor fight with your brethren , the children of Israel ; return every man to his house , for this thing is from me . And they hearkened to the word of Jehovah , and returned to depart , according to the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	25	And Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim , and dwelt therein ; and went out from thence , and built Penuel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	26	And Jeroboam said in his heart , Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	27	If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem , the heart of this people will turn again to their lord , to Rehoboam king of Judah , and they will kill me , and return to Rehoboam king of Judah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	28	And the king took counsel , and made two calves of gold . And he said to them , It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem : behold thy gods , Israel , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt !
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	29	And he set the one in Bethel , and the other he put in Dan .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	30	And this thing became a sin ; and the people went [ to worship ] before the one , as far as Dan .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	31	And he made a house of high places , and made priests from all classes of the people , who were not of the sons of Levi .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	32	And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month , on the fifteenth day of the month , like the feast that was in Judah , and he offered upon the altar . So did he in Bethel , sacrificing to the calves that he had made ; and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made .
DARBY	1%20Kings	12	33	And he offered upon the altar that he had made in Bethel , on the fifteenth day of the eighth month , in the month which he had devised of his own heart ; and he made a feast for the children of Israel , and he offered upon the altar , burning incense .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	13	And he said to his sons , Saddle me the ass . So they saddled him the ass ; and he rode thereon ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	2	And he cried against the altar by the word of Jehovah , and said , O altar , altar ! thus saith Jehovah : Behold , a child shall be born unto the house of David , Josiah by name ; and upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee , and men 's bones shall be burned upon thee .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	3	And he gave a sign the same day , saying , This is the sign that Jehovah hath spoken : Behold , the altar shall be rent , and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	4	And it came to pass when the king heard the word of the man of God , which he cried against the altar in Bethel , that Jeroboam stretched forth his hand from the altar , saying , Lay hold on him . And his hand which he stretched out against him dried up , so that he could not bring it back again to him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	5	And the altar was rent , and the ashes poured out from the altar , according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	6	And the king answered and said to the man of God , Intreat now Jehovah thy God , and pray for me , that my hand may be restored to me again . And the man of God intreated Jehovah , and the king 's hand was restored to him again , and became as before .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	7	And the king said to the man of God , Come home with me , and refresh thyself , and I will give thee a present .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	8	And the man of God said to the king , If thou wilt give me half thy house , I will not go in with thee , neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	9	for so was it charged me by the word of Jehovah , saying , Thou shalt eat no bread , nor drink water , nor return by the way that thou shalt go .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	10	So he went another way , and returned not by the way that he had come to Bethel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	11	Now there dwelt a certain old prophet in Bethel ; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel ; the words that he had spoken to the king , them they told also to their father .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	12	And their father said to them , Which way went he ? for his sons had seen which way the man of God went , who came from Judah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	14	and went after the man of God , and found him sitting under a terebinth ; and he said to him , Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah ? And he said , I am .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	15	And he said to him , Come home with me , and eat bread .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	16	And he said , I can not return with thee , nor go in with thee ; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	17	For it was said to me by the word of Jehovah , Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that thou wentest .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	18	And he said to him , I am a prophet also as thou art ; and an angel spoke to me by the word of Jehovah saying , Bring him back with thee into thy house , that he may eat bread and drink water . He lied unto him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	19	Then he went back with him , and ate bread in his house , and drank water .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	20	And it came to pass as they sat at the table , that the word of Jehovah came to the prophet that brought him back ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	21	and he cried to the man of God that came from Judah , saying , Thus saith Jehovah : Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the word of Jehovah , and hast not kept the commandment that Jehovah thy God commanded thee ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	22	but camest back , and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to thee , Eat no bread and drink no water ; thy carcase shall not come to the sepulchre of thy fathers .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	23	And it came to pass , after he had eaten bread , and after he had drunk , that he saddled the ass for him , for the prophet that he had brought back ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	24	and he departed . And a lion met him by the way and slew him ; and his corpse was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it ; the lion also stood by the corpse .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	25	And behold , men passed by , and saw the corpse cast in the way and the lion standing by the corpse ; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	26	And the prophet that brought him back from the way heard [ of it ] and said , It is the man of God who was disobedient to the word of Jehovah ; therefore Jehovah has delivered him to the lion , which has torn him and slain him , according to the word of Jehovah which he spoke to him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	27	And he spoke to his sons saying , Saddle me the ass ; and they saddled it .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	28	And he went and found his corpse cast in the way , and the ass and the lion standing by the corpse : the lion had not eaten the corpse , nor torn the ass .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	29	And the prophet took up the corpse of the man of God , and laid it upon the ass , and brought it back ; and the old prophet came into the city , to mourn and to bury him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	30	And he laid his corpse in his own sepulchre ; and they mourned over him [ saying ] , Alas , my brother !
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	31	And it came to pass after he had buried him , that he spoke to his sons saying , When I am dead , bury me in the sepulchre in which the man of God is buried ; lay my bones beside his bones .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	32	For the word that he cried by the word of Jehovah against the altar in Bethel , and against all the houses of the high places that are in the cities of Samaria , shall certainly come to pass .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	33	After this thing Jeroboam turned not from his evil way , but made again from all classes of the people priests of the high places : whosoever would , he consecrated him , and he became [ one ] of the priests of the high places .
DARBY	1%20Kings	13	34	And by this thing there was sin on the house of Jeroboam , even to cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	14	And Jehovah shall raise up for himself a king over Israel , who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day ; and what ? … even now .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	2	And Jeroboam said to his wife , Arise , I pray thee , and disguise thyself , that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam ; and go to Shiloh : behold , there is Ahijah the prophet , who told me that [ I should be ] king over this people .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	3	And take with thee ten loaves , and cakes , and a cruse of honey , and go to him : he will tell thee what shall become of the lad .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	4	And Jeroboam 's wife did so , and arose and went to Shiloh , and came to the house of Ahijah . And Ahijah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	5	And Jehovah said to Ahijah , Behold , the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee about her son ; for he is sick : thus and thus shalt thou say unto her ; for it shall be , when she cometh in , that she shall feign to be another .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	6	And it was so , when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet , as she came in at the door , that he said , Come in , thou wife of Jeroboam ; why feignest thou to be another ? But I am sent to thee with a hard [ message ] .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	7	Go , tell Jeroboam , Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel : Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people , and made thee prince over my people Israel ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	8	and rent the kingdom away from the house of David , and gave it thee ; and thou hast not been as my servant David , who kept my commandments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do only that which is right in my sight ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	9	but thou hast done evil above all that were before thee , and hast gone and made thee other gods , and molten images , to provoke me to anger , and hast cast me behind thy back :
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	10	therefore behold , I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam , and will cut off from Jeroboam every male , him that is shut up and left in Israel , and will take away the house of Jeroboam , as a man taketh away dung , till it be all gone .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	11	Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat , and him that dieth in the field shall the fowl of the heavens eat ; for Jehovah hath spoken .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	12	And thou , arise , go to thine own house ; when thy feet enter into the city , the child shall die .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	13	And all Israel shall mourn for him , and they shall bury him ; for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave , because in him there is found something good toward Jehovah the God of Israel , in the house of Jeroboam .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	15	And Jehovah will smite Israel , as a reed is shaken in the water , and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers , and will scatter them beyond the river , because they have made their Asherahs , provoking Jehovah to anger .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	16	And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam , wherewith he has sinned , and made Israel to sin .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	17	And Jeroboam 's wife arose and departed , and came to Tirzah ; when she came to the threshold of the door , the child died .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	18	And they buried him ; and all Israel mourned for him , according to the word of Jehovah , which he spoke through his servant Ahijah the prophet .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	19	And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , how he warred , and how he reigned , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	20	And the days that Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years ; and he slept with his fathers . And Nadab his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	21	And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah . Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign , and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city that Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there ; and his mother 's name was Naamah , an Ammonitess .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	22	And Judah did evil in the sight of Jehovah , and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed more than all that their fathers had done .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	23	And they also built for themselves high places , and columns , and Asherahs on every high hill and under every green tree ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	24	and there were also sodomites in the land . They did according to all the abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed before the children of Israel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	25	And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam , [ that ] Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	26	And he took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he even took away all ; and he took away all the shields of gold that Solomon had made .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	27	And king Rehoboam made in their stead brazen shields , and committed them to the hands of the chief of the couriers who kept the entrance of the king 's house .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	28	And it was so , that as often as the king entered into the house of Jehovah , the couriers bore them , and brought them again into the chamber of the couriers .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	29	And the rest of the acts of Rehoboam , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	30	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all [ their ] days .
DARBY	1%20Kings	14	31	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David . And his mother 's name was Naamah , an Ammonitess . And Abijam his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	15	And he brought into the house of Jehovah the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which he himself had dedicated , silver and gold and vessels .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Maachah , a daughter of Abishalom .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	3	And he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him ; and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God , as the heart of David his father .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	4	But for David 's sake Jehovah his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem , setting up his son after him , and establishing Jerusalem ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	5	because David did that which was right in the sight of Jehovah , and turned not aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life , except in the matter of Urijah the Hittite .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	6	And there had been war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	7	And the rest of the acts of Abijam , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	8	And Abijam slept with his fathers ; and they buried him in the city of David . And Asa his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	9	And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel , Asa began to reign over Judah ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	10	and he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Maachah , daughter of Abishalom .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	11	And Asa did what was right in the sight of Jehovah , as David his father .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	12	And he put away the sodomites out of the land , and removed all the idols that his father had made .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	13	And also Maachah his mother he removed from being queen , because she had made an idol for the Asherah ; and Asa cut down her idol , and burned it in the valley of Kidron .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	14	But the high places were not removed ; only , Asa 's heart was perfect with Jehovah all his days .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	16	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	17	And Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah , and built Ramah , in order to let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	18	And Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of Jehovah , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and gave them into the hand of his servants ; and king Asa sent them to Ben-Hadad , the son of Tabrimmon , the son of Hezion , king of Syria , who dwelt at Damascus , saying ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	19	There is a league between me and thee , [ as ] between my father and thy father ; behold , I send thee a present of silver and gold : go , break thy league with Baasha king of Israel , that he may depart from me .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	20	And Ben-Hadad hearkened to king Asa , and sent the captains of his forces against the cities of Israel , and smote Ijon , and Dan , and Abel-Beth-Maachah , and all Kinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	21	And it came to pass when Baasha heard of it , that he left off building Ramah , and dwelt in Tirzah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	22	And king Asa called together all Judah : none was exempted ; and they carried away the stones and the timber from Ramah , with which Baasha had been building ; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin , and Mizpah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	23	And the rest of all the acts of Asa , and all his might , and all that he did , and the cities that he built , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ? Only , in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	24	And Asa slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father . And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	25	And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah ; and he reigned over Israel two years .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	26	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin with which he made Israel sin .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	27	And Baasha the son of Ahijah , of the house of Issachar , conspired against him ; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon , which [ belonged ] to the Philistines , when Nadab and all Israel were besieging Gibbethon .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	28	And Baasha slew him in the third year of Asa king of Judah , and reigned in his stead .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	29	And it came to pass when he was king , he smote all the house of Jeroboam ; he left to Jeroboam none that breathed ; until he had destroyed him , according to the word of Jehovah which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	30	because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and wherewith he made Israel to sin ; by his provocation with which he provoked Jehovah the God of Israel to anger .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	31	And the rest of the acts of Nadab , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	32	And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	33	In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah , for twenty-four years .
DARBY	1%20Kings	15	34	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah , and walked in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin where with he made Israel to sin .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	16	And the people that were encamped heard say , Zimri has conspired , and has also smitten the king ; and all Israel made Omri , the captain of the host , king over Israel that day in the camp .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	2	Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust , and made thee prince over my people Israel , and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam , and hast made my people Israel to sin , provoking me to anger with their sins ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	3	behold , I will take away Baasha and his house , and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	4	Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat , and him that dieth of his in the field shall the fowl of the heavens eat .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	5	And the rest of the acts of Baasha , and what he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	6	And Baasha slept with his fathers , and was buried in Tirzah ; and Elah his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	7	And also through the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani the word of Jehovah came against Baasha , and against his house , even for all the evil that he did in the sight of Jehovah , provoking him to anger with the work of his hands , in being like the house of Jeroboam ; and because he had smitten him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	8	In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah , Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah for two years .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	9	And his servant Zimri , captain of half [ his ] chariots , conspired against him ; and he was in Tirzah , drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza , who was the steward of his house in Tirzah ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	10	and Zimri went in and smote him , and killed him , in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah , and he reigned in his stead .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	11	And it came to pass when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his throne , he slew all the house of Baasha : he left him not a male , neither of his kinsmen nor of his friends .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	12	And Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha , according to the word of Jehovah , which he spoke against Baasha through Jehu the prophet ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	13	for all the sins of Baasha , and the sins of Elah his son , which they sinned and wherewith they made Israel to sin , provoking Jehovah the God of Israel to anger with their vanities .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	14	And the rest of the acts of Elah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	15	In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah , Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah . Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon , which [ belonged ] to the Philistines .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	17	And Omri went up from Gibbethon , and all Israel with him , and they besieged Tirzah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	18	And it came to pass when Zimri saw that the city was taken , that he went into the citadel of the king 's house , and burned the king 's house over him with fire ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	19	and he died for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of Jehovah , in walking in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin which he did , making Israel to sin .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	20	And the rest of the acts of Zimri , and his conspiracy which he wrought , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	21	Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath , to make him king ; and half followed Omri .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	22	But the people that followed Omri overcame the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath ; and Tibni died , and Omri reigned .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	23	In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah , Omri began to reign over Israel , —twelve years ; he reigned six years in Tirzah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	24	And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver ; and built on the hill , and called the name of the city that he built , after the name of Shemer , owner of the hill , Samaria .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	25	And Omri wrought evil in the sight of Jehovah , and did worse than all that were before him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	26	And he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and in his sins wherewith he made Israel to sin , provoking Jehovah the God of Israel to anger with their vanities .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	27	And the rest of the acts of Omri , what he did , and his might which he shewed , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	28	And Omri slept with his fathers , and was buried in Samaria ; and Ahab his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	29	And Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah ; and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	30	And Ahab the son of Omri wrought evil in the sight of Jehovah more than all that were before him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	31	And it came to pass , as if it was a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians ; and he went and served Baal and worshipped him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	32	And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal , which he built in Samaria .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	33	And Ahab made the Asherah ; and Ahab did more to provoke Jehovah the God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	16	34	In his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho ; he laid its foundation in Abiram his firstborn , and set up its gates in Segub his youngest , according to the word of Jehovah which he spoke through Joshua the son of Nun .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	17	And it came to pass after these things , that the son of the woman , the mistress of the house , fell sick ; and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	2	And the word of Jehovah came to him saying ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	3	Get thee hence , and turn thee eastward , and hide thyself by the torrent Cherith , which is before the Jordan .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	4	And it shall be , that thou shalt drink of the torrent ; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	5	And he went and did according to the word of Jehovah ; he went and abode by the torrent Cherith , which is before the Jordan .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	6	And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning , and bread and flesh in the evening ; and he drank of the torrent .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	7	And it came to pass after a while that the torrent dried up , for there had been no rain in the land .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	8	And the word of Jehovah came to him saying ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	9	Arise , go to Zarephath , which is by Zidon , and abide there : behold , I have commanded a widow woman there to maintain thee .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	10	And he arose and went to Zarephath ; and when he came to the entrance of the city , behold , a widow woman was there gathering sticks . And he called to her and said , Fetch me , I pray thee , a little water in a vessel , that I may drink .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	11	And she went to fetch [ it ] , and he called to her and said , Bring me , I pray thee , a morsel of bread in thy hand .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	12	And she said , As Jehovah thy God liveth , I have not a cake , but a handful of meal in a barrel , and a little oil in a cruse ; and behold , I am gathering two sticks , that I may go in and dress it for me and my son , that we may eat it , and die .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	13	And Elijah said to her , Fear not ; go , do as thou hast said ; but make me thereof a little cake first ; and bring it to me ; and afterwards make for thee and for thy son .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	14	For thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel : The meal in the barrel shall not waste , neither shall the oil in the cruse fail , until the day that Jehovah sendeth rain upon the face of the earth !
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	15	And she went and did according to the word of Elijah ; and she , and he , and her house , ate a whole year .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	16	The meal in the barrel did not waste , neither did the oil in the cruse fail , according to the word of Jehovah which he had spoken through Elijah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	18	And she said to Elijah , What have I to do with thee , O thou man of God ? art thou come to me to call mine iniquity to remembrance , and to slay my son ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	19	And he said to her , Give me thy son . And he took him out of her bosom , and carried him up into the upper chamber where he abode , and laid him upon his own bed .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	20	And he cried to Jehovah and said , Jehovah , my God , hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn , by slaying her son ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	21	And he stretched himself upon the child three times , and cried to Jehovah and said , Jehovah , my God , I pray thee , let this child 's soul come into him again !
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	22	And Jehovah heard the voice of Elijah , and the soul of the child came into him again , and he lived .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	23	And Elijah took the child , and brought him down from the upper chamber into the house , and delivered him to his mother ; and Elijah said , See , thy son lives .
DARBY	1%20Kings	17	24	And the woman said to Elijah , Now by this I know that thou art a man of God , and that the word of Jehovah in thy mouth is truth .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	18	And he said , I have not troubled Israel , but thou and thy father 's house , in that ye have forsaken the commandments of Jehovah , and thou hast followed the Baals .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	2	And Elijah went to shew himself to Ahab . And the famine was severe in Samaria .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	3	And Ahab called Obadiah , who was the steward of his house ( now Obadiah feared Jehovah greatly ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	4	and it was so , when Jezebel cut off the prophets of Jehovah , that Obadiah took a hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and maintained them with bread and water ) ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	5	and Ahab said to Obadiah , Go through the land , to all the fountains of water and to all the torrents , perhaps we may find grass to save the horses and the mules alive , so that we may not have to destroy some of [ our ] beasts .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	6	And they divided the land between them to pass through it : Ahab went one way by himself , and Obadiah went another way by himself .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	7	And as Obadiah was on the way , behold , Elijah met him ; and he knew him , and fell on his face , and said , Is it indeed thou , my lord Elijah ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	8	And he said to him , I [ am he ] : go , say to thy lord , Behold Elijah !
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	9	And he said , What have I sinned , that thou givest thy servant into the hand of Ahab , to put me to death ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	10	As Jehovah thy God liveth , there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord has not sent to seek thee ; and when they said , He is not [ here ] , he took an oath of the kingdom or nation that they found thee not .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	11	And now thou sayest , Go , say to thy lord , Behold Elijah !
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	12	And it shall come to pass when I am gone from thee , that the Spirit of Jehovah shall carry thee whither I know not ; and when I come and tell Ahab , and he can not find thee , he will kill me ; and I thy servant fear Jehovah from my youth .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	13	Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of Jehovah , how I hid a hundred men of Jehovah 's prophets by fifty in a cave , and maintained them with bread and water ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	14	And now thou sayest , Go , say to thy lord , Behold Elijah ! and he will kill me .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	15	And Elijah said , As Jehovah of hosts liveth , before whom I stand , I will certainly shew myself to him to-day .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	16	Then Obadiah went to meet Ahab , and told him . And Ahab went to meet Elijah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	17	And it came to pass when Ahab saw Elijah , that Ahab said to him , Is it thou , the troubler of Israel ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	19	And now send , gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel , and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty , and the prophets of the Asherah four hundred , who eat at Jezebel 's table .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	20	So Ahab sent to all the children of Israel , and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	21	Then Elijah drew near to all the people , and said , How long do ye halt between two opinions ? if Jehovah be God , follow him ; and if Baal , follow him . And the people answered him not a word .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	22	And Elijah said to the people , I , only I , remain a prophet of Jehovah ; and Baal 's prophets are four hundred and fifty men .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	23	Let them therefore give us two bullocks : and let them choose one bullock for themselves , and cut it in pieces , and put it on the wood , and put no fire ; and I will sacrifice the other bullock , and put it on the wood , and put no fire .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	24	And call ye on the name of your gods , and I will call on the name of Jehovah ; and the god that answers by fire , let him be God . And all the people answered and said , The word is good .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	25	And Elijah said to the prophets of Baal , Choose one bullock for yourselves , and sacrifice it first ; for ye are the many ; and call on the name of your god , but put no fire .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	26	And they took the bullock which had been given them , and sacrificed it , and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon , saying , O Baal , answer us ! But there was no voice , and none answered . And they leaped about the altar that had been made .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	27	And it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said , Cry aloud ; for he is a god ; for he is meditating , or gone aside , or he is on a journey ; perhaps he sleeps , and will awake .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	28	And they cried aloud , and cut themselves after their manner with swords and spears , till the blood gushed out upon them .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	29	And it came to pass when midday was past , that they prophesied until the [ time ] of the offering up of the oblation ; but there was neither voice , nor any that answered , nor any attention .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	30	Then Elijah said to all the people , Draw near to me . And all the people drew near to him . And he repaired the altar of Jehovah which was broken down .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	31	And Elijah took twelve stones , according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob , to whom the word of Jehovah came saying , Israel shall be thy name ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	32	and with the stones he built an altar in the name of Jehovah , and made a trench round about the altar , of the capacity of two measures of seed ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	33	and he put the wood in order , and cut the bullock in pieces , and laid it on the wood . And he said , Fill four pitchers with water , and pour it on the burnt-offering , and on the wood .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	34	And he said , Do it the second time . And they did it the second time . And he said , Do it the third time . And they did it the third time .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	35	And the water ran round about the altar ; and he filled the trench also with water .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	36	And it came to pass at [ the time of ] the offering up of the oblation , that Elijah the prophet drew near , and said , Jehovah , God of Abraham , Isaac and Israel , let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel , and that I am thy servant , and that I have done all these things by thy word .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	37	Answer me , Jehovah , answer me , that this people may know that thou Jehovah art God , and [ that ] * thou * hast turned their heart back again .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	38	And the fire of Jehovah fell , and consumed the burnt-offering , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and licked up the water that was in the trench .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	39	And all the people saw [ it ] , and they fell on their faces and said , Jehovah , he is God ! Jehovah , he is God !
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	40	And Elijah said to them , Seize the prophets of Baal ; let not one of them escape ! And they seized them ; and Elijah brought them down to the torrent of Kishon , and slaughtered them there .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	41	And Elijah said to Ahab , Go up , eat and drink ; for there is a sound of abundance of rain .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	42	And Ahab went up to eat and to drink . And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he bowed down on the earth , and put his face between his knees .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	43	And he said to his servant , Go up now , look toward the sea . And he went up and looked , and said , [ There is ] nothing . And he said , Go again seven times .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	44	And it came to pass at the seventh time that he said , Behold there is a cloud , small as a man 's hand , arising out of the sea . And he said , Go up , say to Ahab , Harness and go down , that the pour of rain stop thee not .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	45	And it came to pass in the mean while , that the heavens became black [ with ] clouds and wind , and there was a great pour of rain . And Ahab got on the chariot , and went to Jizreel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	18	46	And the hand of Jehovah was upon Elijah ; and he girded up his loins , and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jizreel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	19	And he departed thence , and found Elisha the son of Shaphat , who was ploughing [ with ] twelve yokes before him , and he with the twelfth ; and Elijah went over to him , and cast his mantle on him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	2	And Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah saying , So do the gods [ to me ] , and more also , if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to-morrow about this time !
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	3	And when he saw [ that ] , he arose , and went for his life , and came to Beer-sheba , which belongs to Judah , and left his servant there .
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	4	And he himself went a day 's journey into the wilderness , and came and sat down under a certain broom-bush , and requested for himself that he might die ; and said , It is enough : now , Jehovah , take my life ; for I am not better than my fathers .
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	5	And he lay down and slept under the broom-bush . And behold , an angel touched him , and said to him , Arise , eat !
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	6	And he looked , and behold , at his head was a cake , baked on hot stones , and a cruse of water . And he ate and drank , and lay down again .
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	7	And the angel of Jehovah came again the second time , and touched him , and said , Arise , eat ; for the journey is too great for thee .
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	8	And he arose , and ate and drank , and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God .
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	9	And there he went into a cave , and lodged there . And behold , the word of Jehovah [ came ] to him , and he said to him , What doest thou here , Elijah ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	10	And he said , I have been very jealous for Jehovah the God of hosts ; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant , thrown down thine altars , and slain thy prophets with the sword ; and I am left , I alone , and they seek my life , to take it away .
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	11	And he said , Go forth , and stand upon the mount before Jehovah . And behold , Jehovah passed by , and a great and strong wind rent the mountains , and broke in pieces the rocks before Jehovah : Jehovah was not in the wind . And after the wind , an earthquake : Jehovah was not in the earthquake .
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	12	And after the earthquake , a fire : Jehovah was not in the fire . And after the fire , a soft gentle voice .
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	13	And it came to pass , when Elijah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his mantle , and went out , and stood in the entrance of the cave . And behold , a voice [ came ] to him and said , What doest thou here , Elijah ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	14	And he said , I have been very jealous for Jehovah the God of hosts ; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant , thrown down thine altars , and slain thy prophets with the sword ; and I am left , I alone , and they seek my life , to take it away .
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	15	And Jehovah said to him , Go , return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus ; and when thou comest , anoint Hazael king over Syria ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	16	and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint king over Israel ; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint prophet in thy stead .
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	17	And it shall come to pass , [ that ] him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay ; and him that escapeth the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay .
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	18	Yet I have left [ myself ] seven thousand in Israel , all the knees that have not bowed unto Baal , and every mouth that hath not kissed him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	20	And he left the oxen , and ran after Elijah , and said , Let me , I pray thee , kiss my father and my mother , and I will follow thee . And he said to him , Go back again ; for what have I done to thee ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	19	21	And he returned back from him , and took the yoke of oxen , and killed them , and boiled their flesh with the implements of the oxen , and gave to the people , and they ate . And he arose and went after Elijah , and ministered to him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	20	And they slew every one his man ; and the Syrians fled , and Israel pursued them ; and Ben-Hadad the king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	2	And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city , and said to him , Thus says Ben-Hadad :
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	3	Thy silver and thy gold is mine ; thy wives also and thy children , the goodliest , are mine .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	4	And the king of Israel answered and said , My lord , O king , according to thy saying , I am thine , and all that I have .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	5	And the messengers came again , and said , Thus speaks Ben-Hadad saying : I sent to thee indeed , saying , Thou shalt deliver me thy silver , and thy gold , and thy wives , and thy children ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	6	but to-morrow about this time I will send my servants to thee , and they shall search thy house , and the houses of thy servants ; and it shall be , that whatsoever is pleasant in thy sight , they shall put in their hand and take away .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	7	And the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said , Mark , I pray you , and see how this [ man ] seeks mischief ; for he sent to me for my wives , and for my children , and for my silver , and for my gold ; and I denied him not .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	8	And all the elders and all the people said to him , Hearken not , nor consent .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	9	And he said to the messengers of Ben-Hadad , Tell my lord the king , All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do ; but this thing I can not do . And the messengers departed , and brought him word again .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	10	And Ben-Hadad sent to him and said , The gods do so to me , and more also , if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me !
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	11	And the king of Israel answered and said , Tell [ him ] , Let not him that girdeth on boast himself as he that putteth off !
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	12	And it came to pass when he heard this word , as he was drinking , he and the kings in the tents , that he said to his servants , Set yourselves . And they set themselves against the city .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	13	And behold , a prophet drew near to Ahab king of Israel , and said , Thus saith Jehovah : Hast thou seen all this great multitude ? behold , I will deliver it into thy hand this day ; and thou shalt know that I am Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	14	And Ahab said , By whom ? And he said , Thus saith Jehovah : By the servants of the princes of the provinces . Then he said , Who shall begin the battle ? And he said , Thou .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	15	And he numbered the servants of the princes of the provinces , and they were two hundred and thirty-two ; and after them he numbered all the people , all the children of Israel , seven thousand .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	16	And they went out at noon ; and Ben-Hadad drank himself drunk in the tents , he and the kings , the thirty-two kings that helped him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	17	And the servants of the princes of the provinces went out first ; and Ben-Hadad sent out , and they told him saying , There are men come out of Samaria .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	18	And he said , Whether they be come out for peace , take them alive ; or whether they be come out for war , take them alive .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	19	And these servants of the princes of the provinces came out of the city , and the army that followed them .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	21	And the king of Israel went out , and smote the horses and chariots , and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	22	And the prophet drew near to the king of Israel , and said to him , Go , strengthen thyself , and understand , and see what thou shalt do ; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	23	And the servants of the king of Syria said to him , Their gods are gods of the mountains ; therefore they were stronger than we ; but if we fight against them on the plateau , shall we not be stronger than they ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	24	And do this : take the kings away , every man out of his place , and put governors in their stead ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	25	and number thee an army , like the army that thou hast lost , horse for horse , and chariot for chariot ; and we will fight against them on the plateau : shall we not be stronger than they ? And he hearkened to their voice , and did so .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	26	And it came to pass , at the return of the year , that Ben-Hadad numbered the Syrians , and went up to Aphek , to fight against Israel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	27	And the children of Israel were numbered and victualled , and they went against them ; and the children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats ; but the Syrians filled the land .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	28	And the man of God drew near , and spoke to the king of Israel and said , Thus saith Jehovah : Because the Syrians have said , Jehovah is a god of the mountains , but he is not a god of the valleys , I will give all this great multitude into thy hand , and ye shall know that I am Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	29	And they encamped one over against the other seven days ; and it came to pass that on the seventh day the battle was joined ; and the children of Israel smote of the Syrians a hundred thousand footmen in one day .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	30	And the rest fled to Aphek , into the city ; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men of them that were left . And Ben-Hadad fled , and came into the city , [ from ] chamber to chamber .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	31	And his servants said to him , Behold now , we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings : let us , I pray thee , put sackcloth on our loins , and ropes upon our heads , and go out to the king of Israel ; perhaps he will save thy life .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	32	And they girded sackcloth on their loins , and ropes on their heads , and came to the king of Israel , and said , Thy servant Ben-Hadad says , I pray thee , let me live . And he said , Is he yet alive ? he is my brother .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	33	And the men took it as a good omen , and hastened to catch what came from him , and they said , Thy brother Ben-Hadad . … And he said , Go , bring him . And Ben-Hadad came forth to him ; and he caused him to come up into the chariot .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	34	And [ Ben-Hadad ] said to him , The cities that my father took from thy father I will restore ; and thou shalt make streets for thyself in Damascus , as my father made in Samaria . And I [ said Ahab ] will send thee away with this covenant . So he made a covenant with him , and sent him away .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	35	And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to another by the word of Jehovah , Smite me , I pray thee . But the man refused to smite him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	36	Then said he to him , Because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah , behold , when thou departest from me , the lion will slay thee . And when he had departed from him , the lion found him and slew him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	37	Then he found another man , and said , Smite me , I pray thee . And the man smote him violently , and wounded [ him ] .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	38	And the prophet departed , and waited for the king by the way , and disguised himself with a sash over his eyes .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	39	And as the king passed by , he cried to the king and said , Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle ; and behold , a man turned aside , and brought a man to me and said , Keep this man ; if by any means he be missing , then shall thy life be for his life , or thou shalt pay a talent of silver .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	40	And as thy servant was busy here and there , he was gone . And the king of Israel said to him , So [ is ] thy judgment : thyself hast decided [ it ] .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	41	Then he hastily took the sash away from his face ; and the king of Israel discerned him , that he was of the prophets .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	42	And he said to him , Thus saith Jehovah : Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the man that I had devoted to destruction , thy life shall be for his life , and thy people for his people .
DARBY	1%20Kings	20	43	And the king of Israel went to his house sullen and vexed , and came to Samaria .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	21	Behold , I will bring evil upon thee , and will take away thy posterity , and will cut off from Ahab every male , and him that is shut up and left in Israel ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	2	And Ahab spoke to Naboth saying , Give me thy vineyard , that I may have it for a garden of herbs , for it is near , by the side of my house ; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it ; if it seem good to thee , I will give thee its value in money .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	3	And Naboth said to Ahab , Jehovah forbid it me , that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to thee !
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	4	And Ahab came into his house sullen and vexed because of the word that Naboth the Jizreelite had spoken to him ; for he had said , I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers . And he lay down on his bed , and turned away his face , and ate no bread .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	5	And Jezebel his wife came to him , and said to him , Why is thy spirit sullen , and thou eatest no bread ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	6	And he said to her , Because I spoke to Naboth the Jizreelite and said to him , Give me thy vineyard for money ; or else , if it please thee , I will give thee a vineyard for it ; and he said , I will not give thee my vineyard .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	7	And Jezebel his wife said to him , Dost thou now exercise sovereignty over Israel ? arise , eat bread , and let thy heart be glad : I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jizreelite .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	8	And she wrote a letter in Ahab 's name , and sealed it with his seal , and sent the letter to the elders and to the nobles that were in his city , dwelling with Naboth .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	9	And she wrote in the letter saying , Proclaim a fast , and set Naboth at the head of the people ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	10	and set two men , sons of Belial , before him , and they shall bear witness against him saying , Thou didst curse God and the king ; and carry him out , and stone him , that he may die .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	11	And the men of his city , the elders and the nobles that dwelt in his city , did as Jezebel had sent to them , as it was written in the letter that she had sent to them :
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	12	they proclaimed a fast , and set Naboth at the head of the people .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	13	And there came the two men , sons of Belial , and sat before him ; and the men of Belial witnessed against him , against Naboth , in the presence of the people , saying , Naboth blasphemed God and the king . And they carried him forth out of the city , and stoned him with stones , that he died .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	14	And they sent to Jezebel saying , Naboth is stoned , and is dead .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	15	And it came to pass when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned and was dead , that Jezebel said to Ahab , Arise , take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jizreelite , which he refused to give thee for money ; for Naboth is not alive , but dead .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	16	And it came to pass when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead , that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jizreelite , to take possession of it .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	17	And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite , saying ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	18	Arise , go down to meet Ahab king of Israel , who is in Samaria : behold , he is in the vineyard of Naboth , whither he is gone down to take possession of it .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	19	And thou shalt speak unto him saying , Thus saith Jehovah : Hast thou killed , and also taken possession ? And thou shalt speak unto him saying , Thus saith Jehovah : In the place where the dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall the dogs lick thy blood , even thine .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	20	And Ahab said to Elijah , Hast thou found me , mine enemy ? And he said , I have found [ thee ] ; because thou hast sold thyself to do evil in the sight of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	22	and I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah , for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger , and made Israel to sin .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	23	And of Jezebel also spoke Jehovah saying , The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the moat of Jizreel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	24	Him that dieth of Ahab in the city shall the dogs eat , and him that dieth in the field shall the fowl of the heavens eat .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	25	( Surely there was none like to Ahab , who did sell himself to do evil in the sight of Jehovah , Jezebel his wife urging him on .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	26	And he did very abominably in following idols , according to all that the Amorites did , whom Jehovah had dispossessed before the children of Israel . )
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	27	And it came to pass when Ahab heard these words , that he rent his garments , and put sackcloth upon his flesh , and fasted , and lay in sackcloth , and went softly .
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	28	And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah the Tishbite , saying ,
DARBY	1%20Kings	21	29	Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me ? because he humbleth himself before me , I will not bring the evil in his days : in his son 's days will I bring the evil upon his house .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	1	Kings
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	22	And Jehovah said unto him , Wherewith ? And he said , I will go forth , and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets . And he said , Thou shalt entice [ him ] , and also succeed : go forth , and do so .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	2	And it came to pass in the third year , that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	3	And the king of Israel said to his servants , Do ye know that Ramoth in Gilead is ours , and we keep quiet without taking it out of the hand of the king of Syria ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	4	And he said to Jehoshaphat , Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-Gilead ? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , I am as thou , my people as thy people , my horses as thy horses .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	5	And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , Inquire , I pray thee , this day of the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	6	And the king of Israel assembled the prophets , about four hundred men , and said to them , Shall I go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle , or shall I forbear ? And they said , Go up , and the Lord will give it into the king 's hand .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	7	But Jehoshaphat said , Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides , that we might inquire of him ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	8	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah ; but I hate him , for he prophesies no good concerning me , but evil : [ it is ] Micah the son of Imlah . And Jehoshaphat said , Let not the king say so .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	9	Then the king of Israel called a chamberlain , and said , Fetch quickly Micah the son of Imlah .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	10	And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah , having put on their robes , sat each on his throne , in the open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	11	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron , and he said , Thus saith Jehovah : With these shalt thou push the Syrians , until thou have exterminated them .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	12	And all the prophets prophesied so , saying , Go up to Ramoth-Gilead , and prosper ; for Jehovah will give it into the king 's hand .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	13	And the messenger that went to call Micah spoke to him saying , Behold now , the words of the prophets [ declare ] good to the king with one assent : let thy word , I pray thee , be like the word of one of them , and speak good .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	14	And Micah said , As Jehovah liveth , even what Jehovah shall say to me , that will I speak .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	15	And he came to the king . And the king said to him , Micah , shall we go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle , or shall we forbear ? And he said to him , Go up , and prosper ; for Jehovah will give it into the hand of the king .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	16	And the king said to him , How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but truth in the name of Jehovah ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	17	And he said , I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains , as sheep that have no shepherd . And Jehovah said , These have no master : let them return every man to his house in peace .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	18	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , Did I not tell thee that he prophesies no good concerning me , but evil ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	19	And he said , Hear therefore the word of Jehovah : I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne , and all the host of heaven standing by him , on his right hand and on his left ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	20	and Jehovah said , Who shall entice Ahab that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead ? And one said after this manner , and another said after that manner .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	21	And there came forth a spirit , and stood before Jehovah , and said , I will entice him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	23	And now , behold , Jehovah has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets , and Jehovah has spoken evil concerning thee .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	24	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near , and smote Micah upon the cheek , and said , Where now went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak to thee ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	25	And Micah said , Behold , thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go from chamber to chamber to hide thyself .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	26	And the king of Israel said , Take Micah and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city , and to Joash the king 's son ;
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	27	and thou shalt say , Thus says the king : Put this [ man ] in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I come in peace .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	28	And Micah said , If thou return at all in peace , Jehovah has not spoken by me . And he said , Hearken , O peoples , all of you !
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	29	And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-Gilead .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	30	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , I will disguise myself , and will enter into the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . And the king of Israel disguised himself , and went into the battle .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	31	And the king of Syria commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots saying , Fight neither with small nor great , but with the king of Israel only .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	32	And it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , Surely that is the king of Israel ; and they turned against him to fight ; and Jehoshaphat cried out .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	33	And it came to pass that when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back from pursuing him .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	34	And a man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of Israel between the fastenings and the corslet . And he said to his charioteer , Turn thy hand , and drive me out of the camp ; for I am wounded .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	35	And the battle increased that day ; and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians , and he died at even ; and the blood of the wound ran out into the hollow of the chariot .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	36	And there went the cry throughout the host at the going down of the sun , saying , Every man to his city , and every man to his own country !
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	37	And the king died , and was brought to Samaria ; and they buried the king in Samaria .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	38	And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria ; and the dogs licked his blood , where the harlots bathed : according to the word of Jehovah , which he had spoken .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	39	And the rest of the acts of Ahab , and all that he did , and the ivory house that he built , and all the cities that he built , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	40	And Ahab slept with his fathers ; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	41	And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Azubah , the daughter of Shilhi .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	43	And he walked in all the way of Asa his father ; he turned not aside from it , doing what was right in the sight of Jehovah . Only , the high places were not removed : the people offered and burned incense still on the high places .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	44	And Jehoshaphat was at peace with the king of Israel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	45	And the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , and his might which he shewed , and how he warred , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	46	And the remainder of the sodomites , which were left in the days of his father Asa , he put away from out of the land .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	47	And there was no king in Edom : a deputy reigned .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	48	Jehoshaphat made Tarshish-ships to go to Ophir for gold ; but they went not , for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	49	Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab to Jehoshaphat , Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships . But Jehoshaphat would not .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	50	And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father ; and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	51	Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah ; and he reigned two years over Israel .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	52	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
DARBY	1%20Kings	22	53	And he served Baal , and worshipped him , and provoked Jehovah the God of Israel to anger , according to all that his father had done .
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	2	And Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper chamber which was in Samaria , and was sick ; and he sent messengers and said to them , Go , inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron , whether I shall recover from this disease .
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	1	And Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab .
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	3	And the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah the Tishbite , Arise , go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria , and say to them , Is it because there is not a God in Israel , that ye go to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	4	Now therefore thus saith Jehovah : Thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou art gone up , but shalt certainly die . And Elijah departed .
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	5	And the messengers returned to him ; and he said to them , Why have ye returned ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	6	And they said unto him , A man came up to meet us , and said to us , Go , return to the king that sent you and say to him , Thus saith Jehovah : Is it because there is not a God in Israel , that thou sendest to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron ? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou art gone up , but shalt certainly die .
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	7	And he said to them , What manner of man was he that came up to meet you , and told you these words ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	8	And they said to him , He was a man in a hairy [ garment ] , and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins . And he said , It is Elijah the Tishbite .
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	9	And he sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty . And he went up to him , and behold , he sat on the top of the mount . And he spoke to him : Man of God , the king says , Come down !
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	10	And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty , And if I be a man of God , let fire come down from the heavens and consume thee and thy fifty . And there came down fire from the heavens , and consumed him and his fifty .
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	11	And again he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty . And he spoke and said to him , Man of God , thus says the king : Come down quickly !
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	12	And Elijah answered and said to them , If I be a man of God , let fire come down from the heavens and consume thee and thy fifty . And the fire of God came down from the heavens , and consumed him and his fifty .
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	13	And again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty . And the third captain of fifty went up , and came and fell on his knees before Elijah , and besought him and said to him , Man of God , I pray thee , let my life , and the life of these fifty thy servants , be precious in thy sight .
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	14	Behold , there came down fire from the heavens , and consumed the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties ; but now , let my life be precious in thy sight .
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	15	And the angel of Jehovah said to Elijah , Go down with him : be not afraid of him . And he arose , and went down with him to the king .
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	16	And he said to him , Thus saith Jehovah : Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron , is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word ? therefore thou shalt not come down from the bed on which thou art gone up , but shalt certainly die .
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	17	And he died according to the word of Jehovah that Elijah had spoken . And Jehoram began to reign in his stead , in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah ; for he had no son .
DARBY	2%20Kings	1	18	And the rest of the acts of Ahaziah , what he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	2	And Elijah said to Elisha , Abide here , I pray thee ; for Jehovah has sent me to Bethel . And Elisha said , As Jehovah liveth , and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee ! So they went down to Bethel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	3	And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha , and said to him , Dost thou know that Jehovah will take away thy master from over thy head to-day ? And he said , I also know it : be silent !
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	4	And Elijah said to him , Elisha , abide here , I pray thee ; for Jehovah has sent me to Jericho . And he said , As Jehovah liveth , and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee ! And they came to Jericho .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	5	And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho drew near to Elisha and said to him , Dost thou know that Jehovah will take away thy master from over thy head to-day ? And he said , I also know it : be silent !
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	6	And Elijah said to him , Abide here , I pray thee ; for Jehovah has sent me to the Jordan . And he said , As Jehovah liveth , and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee ! And they two went on .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	7	And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite afar off ; and they two stood by the Jordan .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	8	And Elijah took his mantle , and wrapped it together , and smote the waters , and they were divided hither and thither ; and they two went over on dry ground .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	9	And it came to pass when they had gone over , that Elijah said to Elisha , Ask what I shall do for thee , before I am taken away from thee . And Elisha said , I pray thee , let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	10	And he said , Thou hast asked a hard thing : if thou see me when I am taken from thee , it shall be so to thee ; but if not , it shall not be [ so ] .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	11	And it came to pass as they went on , and talked , that behold , a chariot of fire and horses of fire ; and they parted them both asunder ; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into the heavens .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	12	And Elisha saw [ it ] , and he cried , My father , my father ! the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof ! And he saw him no more . Then he took hold of his own garments and rent them in two pieces .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	13	And he took up the mantle of Elijah which fell from him , and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	14	and he took the mantle of Elijah which had fallen from him , and smote the waters , and said , Where is Jehovah , the God of Elijah ? He also smote the waters , and they parted hither and thither , and Elisha went over .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	15	And the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho on the opposite side saw him , and they said , The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha . And they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	16	and said to him , Behold now , there are with thy servants fifty valiant men ; let them go , we pray thee , and seek thy master , lest perhaps the Spirit of Jehovah have taken him up , and cast him upon some mountain , or into some ravine . And he said , Ye shall not send .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	17	And they pressed him till he was ashamed , and he said , Send . They sent therefore fifty men , and they sought three days , but did not find him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	18	And they came again to him ( now he was staying at Jericho ) ; and he said to them , Did I not say to you , Go not ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	19	And the men of the city said to Elisha , Behold now , the situation of the city is good , as my lord sees ; but the water is bad , and the land is barren .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	20	And he said , Bring me a new cruse , and put salt in it . And they brought it to him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	21	And he went forth to the source of the waters , and cast the salt in there , and said , Thus saith Jehovah : I have healed these waters : there shall not be from thence any more death or barrenness .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	22	And the waters were healed to this day , according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	23	And he went up from thence to Bethel , and as he went up by the way , there came forth little boys out of the city , and mocked him , and said to him , Go up , bald head ; go up , bald head !
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	24	And he turned back , and looked on them , and cursed them in the name of Jehovah . And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood , and tore forty-two children of them .
DARBY	2%20Kings	2	25	And he went from thence to mount Carmel , and from thence he returned to Samaria .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	2	And he wrought evil in the sight of Jehovah , but not like his father , and like his mother ; and he took away the column of Baal that his father had made .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	3	Only , he clave to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat who made Israel to sin : he did not depart therefrom .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	4	And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster , and rendered to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams , with the wool .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	5	And it came to pass when Ahab was dead , that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	6	And at that time king Jehoram went out of Samaria and inspected all Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	7	And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah saying , The king of Moab has rebelled against me : wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle ? And he said , I will go up : I am as thou , my people as thy people , my horses as thy horses .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	8	And he said , Which way shall we go up ? And he said , By way of the wilderness of Edom .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	9	And the king of Israel went , and the king of Judah , and the king of Edom , and they made a circuit of seven days ' journey . And there was no water for the army , and for the cattle that followed them .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	10	And the king of Israel said , Alas ! that Jehovah has called these three kings together , to give them into the hand of Moab !
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	11	And Jehoshaphat said , Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah that we may inquire of Jehovah by him ? And one of the king of Israel 's servants answered and said , Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat , who poured water on the hands of Elijah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	12	And Jehoshaphat said , The word of Jehovah is with him . And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	13	And Elisha said to the king of Israel , What have I to do with thee ? go to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother . And the king of Israel said to him , Not so , for Jehovah has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	14	And Elisha said , As Jehovah of hosts liveth , before whom I stand , surely , were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah , I would not look toward thee nor see thee .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	15	And now fetch me a minstrel . And it came to pass when the minstrel played , that the hand of Jehovah was upon him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	16	And he said , Thus saith Jehovah : Make this valley full of ditches .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	17	For thus saith Jehovah : Ye shall not see wind , neither shall ye see rain ; yet this valley shall be filled with water , and ye shall drink , both ye , and your cattle , and your beasts .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	18	And this is a light thing in the sight of Jehovah : he will give the Moabites also into your hand .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	19	And ye shall smite every fortified city , and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree , and stop all wells of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	20	And it came to pass in the morning , when the oblation was offered up , that behold , there came water by the way of Edom , and the country was filled with water .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	21	And all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them , and they were called together , all that were able to put on armour , and upward , and stood by the border .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	22	And they rose up early in the morning , and the sun rose upon the water , and the Moabites saw the water on the other side red as blood .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	23	And they said , This is blood : the kings are entirely destroyed , and have smitten one another ; and now , Moab , to the spoil !
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	24	And when they came to the camp of Israel , the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites , and they fled before them ; and they entered in and smote Moab .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	25	And they beat down the cities , and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone and filled it , and they stopped every well of water , and felled every good tree , until they left [ only ] the stones at Kirhareseth ; and the slingers went about it , and smote it .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	26	And the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him , and he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords , to break through to the king of Edom , but they could not .
DARBY	2%20Kings	3	27	And he took his eldest son , that should have reigned in his stead , and offered him up for a burnt-offering upon the wall . And there was great wrath against Israel ; and they departed from him , and returned to [ their own ] land .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	2	And Elisha said to her , What shall I do for thee ? Tell me , what hast thou in the house ? And she said , Thy handmaid has not anything at all in the house but a pot of oil .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	4	and go in , and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons , and pour out into all those vessels , and set aside what is full .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	3	And he said , Go , borrow for thyself vessels abroad from all thy neighbours , empty vessels ; let it not be few ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	5	And she went from him , and shut the door upon her and upon her sons : they brought [ the vessels ] to her , and she poured out .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	6	And it came to pass when the vessels were full , that she said to her son , Bring me yet a vessel . And he said to her , There is not a vessel more . And the oil stayed .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	7	And she came and told the man of God ; and he said , Go , sell the oil , and pay thy debt , and live thou [ and ] thy sons on the rest .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	8	And it came to pass on a day , that Elisha passed to Shunem , where was a wealthy woman ; and she constrained him to eat bread . And so it was , [ that ] as oft as he passed by , he turned in thither to eat bread .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	9	And she said to her husband , Behold now , I perceive that this is a holy man of God , who passes by us continually .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	10	Let us make , I pray thee , a small upper chamber with walls , and let us set for him there a bed , and a table , and a seat , and a lampstand ; and it shall be when he cometh to us , he shall turn in thither .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	11	And it came to pass on a day , that he came thither , and he turned into the upper chamber , and lay there .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	12	And he said to Gehazi his servant , Call this Shunammite . And he called her , and she stood before him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	13	And he said to him , Say now to her , Behold , thou hast been careful for us with all this care ; what is to be done for thee ? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king , or to the captain of the host ? And she said , I dwell among mine own people .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	14	And he said , What then is to be done for her ? And Gehazi said , Verily , she has no son , and her husband is old .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	15	And he said , Call her ; and he called her ; and she stood in the doorway .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	16	And he said , At this appointed time , when thy term is come , thou shalt embrace a son . And she said , No , my lord , man of God , do not lie to thy handmaid .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	17	And the woman conceived , and bore a son at that appointed time in the next year as Elisha had said to her .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	18	And the child grew , and it came to pass one day , that he went out to his father to the reapers .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	19	And he said to his father , My head , my head ! And he said to the servant , Carry him to his mother .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	20	And he carried him , and brought him to his mother ; and he sat on her knees till noon , and died .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	21	And she went up , and laid him on the bed of the man of God , and shut [ the door ] upon him , and went out .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	22	And she called to her husband , and said , Send me , I pray thee , one of the young men , and one of the asses , and I will run to the man of God , and come again .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	23	And he said , Why wilt thou go to him to-day ? It is neither new moon nor sabbath . And she said , [ It is ] well .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	24	Then she saddled the ass , and said to her servant , Drive and go forward ; slack not the riding for me , except I bid thee .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	25	And she went and came to the man of God , to mount Carmel . And it came to pass when the man of God saw her afar off , that he said to Gehazi his servant , Behold , there is the Shunammite :
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	26	run now , I pray thee , to meet her , and say unto her , Is it well with thee ? is it well with thy husband ? is it well with the child ? And she said , It is well .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	27	And she came to the man of God to the mountain , and caught him by the feet ; and Gehazi drew near to thrust her away ; but the man of God said , Let her alone , for her soul is troubled within her , and Jehovah has hidden it from me , and has not told me .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	28	And she said , Did I desire a son of my lord ? did I not say , Do not deceive me ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	29	And he said to Gehazi , Gird up thy loins , and take my staff in thy hand , and go thy way . If thou meet any man , salute him not , and if any salute thee , answer him not again ; and lay my staff upon the face of the lad .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	30	And the mother of the lad said , As Jehovah liveth , and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee ! And he rose up and followed her .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	31	And Gehazi passed on before them , and laid the staff upon the face of the lad ; but there was neither voice , nor sign of attention . And he returned to meet him , and told him saying , The lad is not awaked .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	32	And when Elisha came into the house , behold , the child was dead , [ and ] laid upon his bed .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	33	And he went in and shut the door upon them both , and prayed to Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	34	And he went up , and lay upon the child , and put his mouth upon his mouth , and his eyes upon his eyes , and his hands upon his hands , and bent over him ; and the flesh of the child grew warm .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	35	And he returned , and walked in the house to and fro ; and went up , and bent over him . And the lad sneezed seven times , and the lad opened his eyes .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	36	And he called Gehazi , and said , Call this Shunammite . And he called her ; and she came to him . And he said , Take up thy son .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	37	And she came and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground ; and she took up her son , and went out .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	38	And Elisha came again to Gilgal . And there was a famine in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him . And he said to his servant , Set on the great pot , and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	39	Then one went out into the field to gather herbs , and found a wild vine , and gathered from it his lap full of wild colocynths , and came and shred them into the pot of pottage ; for they did not know them .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	40	And they poured out for the men to eat . And it came to pass , as they were eating of the pottage , that they cried out and said , Man of God , there is death in the pot ! And they could not eat [ it ] .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	41	And he said , Then bring meal . And he cast [ it ] into the pot , and said , Pour out for the people , that they may eat . And there was no harm in the pot .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	42	And there came a man from Baal-shalishah , and brought the man of God bread of the first-fruits , twenty loaves of barley , and fresh ears of corn in his sack . And he said , Give to the people that they may eat .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	43	And his attendant said , How shall I set this before a hundred men ? And he said , Give the people that they may eat ; for thus saith Jehovah : They shall eat , and shall have to spare .
DARBY	2%20Kings	4	44	And he set [ it ] before them , and they ate and left [ thereof ] , according to the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	2	And the Syrians had gone out in bands , and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid ; and she waited on Naaman 's wife .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	5	And the king of Syria said , Well ! go , and I will send a letter to the king of Israel . And he departed , and took with him ten talents of silver , and six thousand [ shekels ] of gold , and ten changes of raiment .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	3	And she said to her mistress , Oh , would that my lord were before the prophet that is in Samaria ! then he would cure him of his leprosy .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	4	And he went and told his lord saying , Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	6	And he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , And now , when this letter comes to thee , behold , I have sent Naaman my servant to thee , that thou mayest cure him of his leprosy .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	7	And it came to pass when the king of Israel had read the letter , that he rent his garments , and said , Am I God , to kill and to make alive , that this man sends to me to cure a man of his leprosy ? Wherefore consider , I pray you , and see how he seeks an occasion against me .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	8	And it was so , when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his garments , that he sent to the king , saying , Why hast thou rent thy garments ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	9	And Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot , and stood at the doorway of the house of Elisha .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	10	And Elisha sent a messenger to him , saying , Go and wash in the Jordan seven times , and thy flesh shall come again to thee , and thou shalt be clean .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	11	And Naaman was wroth , and went away and said , Behold , I thought , He will certainly come out to me , and stand , and call on the name of Jehovah his God , and wave his hand over the place , and cure the leper .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	12	Are not the Abanah and the Pharpar , rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? may I not wash in them and be clean ? And he turned and went away in a rage .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	13	And his servants drew near , and spoke to him and said , My father , [ if ] the prophet had bidden thee [ do some ] great thing , wouldest thou not have done it ? how much rather then , when he says to thee , Wash and be clean ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	14	Then he went down , and plunged himself seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God . And his flesh became again like the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	15	And he returned to the man of God , he and all his company , and came and stood before him ; and he said , Behold , I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel ; and now , I pray thee , take a present of thy servant .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	16	But he said , As Jehovah liveth , before whom I stand , I will receive none ! And he urged him to take it ; but he refused .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	17	And Naaman said , If not , then let there , I pray thee , be given to thy servant two mules ' burden of [ this ] earth ; for thy servant will no more offer burnt-offering and sacrifice to other gods , but to Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	18	In this thing Jehovah pardon thy servant : when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to bow down there , and he leans on my hand , and I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon—when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon , Jehovah pardon thy servant , I pray thee , in this thing .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	19	And he said to him , Go in peace . And he departed from him a little way .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	20	And Gehazi , the servant of Elisha the man of God , said , Behold , my master has spared Naaman , this Syrian , in not receiving at his hands that which he brought ; but as Jehovah liveth , I will run after him and take somewhat of him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	21	And Gehazi followed after Naaman . And when Naaman saw him running after him , he sprang down from the chariot to meet him , and said , Is all well ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	22	And he said , All is well . My master has sent me saying , Behold , even now there are come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets ; give them , I pray thee , a talent of silver , and two changes of raiment .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	23	And Naaman said , Consent to take two talents . And he urged him , and bound two talents of silver in two bags , with two changes of raiment , and laid them upon two of his young men ; and they bore them before him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	24	And when he came to the hill , he took them from their hand , and stowed them in the house ; and he let the men go , and they departed .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	25	And he entered in and stood before his master . And Elisha said to him , Whence [ comest thou ] , Gehazi ? And he said , Thy servant went no whither .
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	26	And he said to him , Did not my heart go , when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee ? Is it a time to receive money , and to receive garments , and oliveyards , and vineyards , and sheep , and oxen , and bondmen , and bondwomen ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	5	27	But the leprosy of Naaman shall fasten upon thee , and upon thy seed for ever . And he went out from his presence leprous , as snow .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	2	Let us go , we pray thee , to the Jordan , and take thence every man a beam , and let us make us a place there , where we may dwell . And he said , Go .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	6	And the man of God said , Where did it fall ? And he shewed him the place . And he cut down a stick , and cast it in thither , and made the iron to swim .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	3	And one said , Consent , I pray thee , to go with thy servants . And he said , I will go .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	4	And he went with them . And they came to the Jordan and cut down the trees .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	5	And it came to pass as one was felling a beam , that the iron fell into the water ; and he cried and said , Alas , master , and it was borrowed !
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	7	And he said , Take [ it ] up to thee . And he put out his hand and took it .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	8	And the king of Syria warred against Israel ; and he took counsel with his servants , saying , In such and such a place [ shall be ] my camp .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	9	And the man of God sent to the king of Israel , saying , Beware that thou pass not such a place , for thither the Syrians are come down .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	10	And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of , and he was on his guard there . [ That took place ] not once , nor twice .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	11	And the heart of the king of Syria was troubled because of this thing ; and he called his servants , and said to them , Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	12	And one of his servants said , None , my lord , O king ; but Elisha , the prophet that is in Israel , tells the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	13	And he said , Go and see where he is , and I will send and fetch him . And it was told him saying , Behold , he is in Dothan .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	14	And he sent thither horses and chariots , and a great host , and they came by night and surrounded the city .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	15	And when the attendant of the man of God rose early and went forth , behold , an army surrounded the city , with horses and chariots . And his servant said to him , Alas , my master ! how shall we do ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	16	And he said , Fear not , for they that are with us are more than they that are with them .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	17	And Elisha prayed and said , Jehovah , I pray thee , open his eyes that he may see . And Jehovah opened the eyes of the young man , and he saw ; and , behold , the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	18	And they came down to him ; and Elisha prayed to Jehovah and said , Smite this nation , I pray thee , with blindness . And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	19	And Elisha said to them , This is not the way , neither is this the city : follow me , and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek . And he led them to Samaria .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	20	And it came to pass when they entered into Samaria , that Elisha said , Jehovah , open the eyes of these [ men ] that they may see . And Jehovah opened their eyes , and they saw , and behold , they were in the midst of Samaria .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	21	And the king of Israel said to Elisha , when he saw them , My father , shall I smite ? shall I smite [ them ] ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	22	And he said , Thou shalt not smite [ them ] : wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow ? Set bread and water before them , that they may eat and drink , and go to their master .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	23	And he prepared a great repast for them , and they ate and drank ; and he sent them away , and they went to their master . And the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	24	And it came to pass after this that Ben-Hadad king of Syria gathered all his army , and went up and besieged Samaria .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	25	And there was a great famine in Samaria ; and behold , they besieged it , until an ass 's head was worth eighty silver-pieces , and the fourth part of a cab of dove 's dung five silver-pieces .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	26	And it came to pass as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall , there cried a woman to him saying , Help , my lord O king !
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	27	And he said , If Jehovah do not help thee , whence should I help thee ? Out of the threshing-floor , or out of the winepress ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	28	And the king said to her , What aileth thee ? And she said , This woman said to me , Give thy son , that we may eat him to-day , and we will eat my son to-morrow .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	29	And we boiled my son , and ate him : and I said to her on the next day , Give thy son , that we may eat him ; and she has hidden her son .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	30	And it came to pass when the king heard the words of the woman , that he rent his garments ; and he was passing by upon the wall , and the people looked , and behold , he had sackcloth within upon his flesh .
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	31	And he said , God do so , and more also to me , if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall remain on him this day !
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	32	And Elisha sat in his house , and the elders sat with him . And [ the king ] sent a man before him . Before the messenger came to him , he himself said to the elders , Do ye see how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head ? See , when the messenger comes ; shut the door , and keep him off with the door : is not the sound of his master 's feet behind him ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	6	33	And while he yet talked with them , behold , the messenger came down to him . And [ the king ] said , Behold , this evil is of Jehovah : why should I wait for Jehovah any longer ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	2	And the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said , Behold , if Jehovah should make windows in the heavens , would this thing be ? And he said , Behold , thou shalt see it with thine eyes , but shalt not eat thereof .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	7	And they rose up and fled in the dusk , and left their tents , and their horses , and their asses , the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	3	And there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate , and they said one to another , Why do we abide here until we die ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	4	If we say , Let us enter into the city , the famine is in the city , and we shall die there ; and if we abide here , we shall die . And now come , let us fall away to the camp of the Syrians : if they save us alive , we shall live ; and if they put us to death , we shall but die .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	5	And they rose up in the dusk to go to the camp of the Syrians ; and they came to the extremity of the camp of the Syrians ; and behold , there was no man there .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	6	For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots , and a noise of horses , a noise of a great host ; and they said one to another , Behold , the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites , and the kings of the Egyptians , to come upon us .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	8	And those lepers came to the extremity of the camp ; and they went into one tent , and ate and drank , and carried thence silver and gold , and garments , and went and hid it ; and they came again , and entered into another tent , and carried thence , and went and hid [ it ] .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	9	And they said one to another , We are not doing right ; this day is a day of good tidings , and we hold our peace : if we tarry till the morning light , the iniquity will find us out ; and now come , let us go and tell the king 's household .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	10	And they came and called to the porters of the city , and told them saying , We came to the camp of the Syrians , and behold , there was no one there , no sound of man , but the horses tied , and the asses tied , and the tents as they were .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	11	And the porters cried [ it ] and told [ it ] to the king 's house within .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	12	And the king rose up in the night and said to his servants , Let me tell you what the Syrians have done to us . They know that we are hungry , and they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field , saying , When they come out of the city , we shall catch them alive , and get into the city .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	13	And one of his servants answered and said , Let some one take , I pray thee , five of the horses that remain , which are left in the city ( behold , they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it : behold , they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that have perished ) , and let us send and see .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	14	And they took two chariots with their horses ; and the king sent after the army of the Syrians , saying , Go and see .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	15	And they went after them to the Jordan ; and behold , all the way was full of garments and materials , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste . And the messengers returned and told the king .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	16	And the people went out and plundered the camp of the Syrians ; and the measure of fine flour was at a shekel , and two measures of barley at a shekel , according to the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	17	And the king had appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate ; and the people trampled upon him in the gate , and he died , according to what the man of God had said , —what he had said when the king came down to him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	18	And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king saying , Two measures of barley shall be at a shekel , and the measure of fine flour at a shekel , to-morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	19	And the captain answered the man of God and said , Behold , if Jehovah should make windows in the heavens , would such a thing be ? And he said , Behold , thou shalt see it with thine eyes , but shalt not eat thereof .
DARBY	2%20Kings	7	20	And so it happened to him ; and the people trampled upon him in the gate , and he died .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	2	And the woman rose up , and did according to the saying of the man of God , and went , she and her household , and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	8	And the king said to Hazael , Take a present in thy hand , and go , meet the man of God , and inquire of Jehovah by him , saying , Shall I recover from this disease ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	3	And it came to pass at the seven years ' end , that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines ; and she went forth to cry to the king for her house and for her land .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	4	And the king was talking with Gehazi , the servant of the man of God , saying , Tell me , I pray thee , all the great things that Elisha has done .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	5	And it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life , that behold , the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land . And Gehazi said , My lord , O king , this is the woman , and this is her son , whom Elisha restored to life .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	6	And the king asked the woman , and she told him . And the king appointed a certain chamberlain , saying , Restore all that was hers , and all the revenue of the land since the day that she left the country even until now .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	7	And Elisha came to Damascus ; and Ben-Hadad the king of Syria was sick ; and it was told him saying , The man of God is come hither .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	9	And Hazael went to meet him , and took with him a present , even of every good thing of Damascus , forty camels ' burden ; and he came and stood before him , and said , Thy son Ben-Hadad king of Syria has sent me to thee , saying , Shall I recover from this disease ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	10	And Elisha said to him , Go , say to him , Thou wilt certainly recover . But Jehovah has shewn me that he shall certainly die .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	11	And he settled his countenance stedfastly , until he was ashamed ; and the man of God wept .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	12	And Hazael said , Why does my lord weep ? And he said , Because I know the evil that thou wilt do to the children of Israel : their strongholds wilt thou set on fire , and their young men wilt thou kill with the sword , and wilt dash in pieces their children , and rip up their women with child .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	13	And Hazael said , But what , is thy servant a dog , that he should do this great thing ? And Elisha said , Jehovah has shewn me that thou wilt be king over Syria .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	14	And he departed from Elisha , and came to his master , who said to him , What did Elisha say to thee ? And he said , He told me [ that ] thou wouldest certainly recover .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	15	And it came to pass the next day , that he took the coverlet and dipped [ it ] in water , and spread it over his face , so that he died ; and Hazael reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	16	And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab , king of Israel , Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah , Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat , king of Judah , began to reign .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	17	He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	18	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab , for the daughter of Ahab was his wife ; and he did evil in the sight of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	19	But Jehovah would not destroy Judah , for David his servant 's sake , as he had promised him to give him always a lamp for his sons .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	20	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah , and they set a king over themselves .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	21	And Joram went over to Zair , and all the chariots with him ; and he rose up by night , and smote the Edomites who had surrounded him , and the captains of the chariots ; and the people fled into their tents .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	22	But the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day . Then Libnah revolted at the same time .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	23	And the rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	24	And Joram slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David ; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	25	In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab , king of Israel , Ahaziah the son of Jehoram , king of Judah , began to reign .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	26	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Athaliah , the daughter of Omri king of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	27	And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab , and did evil in the sight of Jehovah , like the house of Ahab ; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	28	And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael the king of Syria at Ramoth-Gilead ; and the Syrians wounded Joram .
DARBY	2%20Kings	8	29	And king Joram returned to be healed in Jizreel of the wounds that the Syrians had given him at Ramah , when he fought with Hazael king of Syria . And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram , king of Judah , went down to see Joram the son of Ahab at Jizreel , for he was sick .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	2	And when thou art come thither , look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat , son of Nimshi , and go in , and make him rise up from among his brethren , and bring him to an inner chamber ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	9	And I will make the house of Ahab as the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and as the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	3	then take the vial of oil , and pour it on his head and say , Thus saith Jehovah : I have anointed thee king over Israel ; and open the door , and flee , and tarry not .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	4	And the young man , the young prophet , went to Ramoth-Gilead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	5	And when he came , behold , the captains of the host were sitting . And he said , I have an errand to thee , captain . And Jehu said , To which of all of us ? And he said , To thee , captain .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	6	And he rose up and went into the house ; and he poured the oil on his head , and said to him , Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel : I have anointed thee king over the people of Jehovah , over Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	7	And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master ; and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of Jehovah at the hand of Jezebel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	8	And the whole house of Ahab shall perish , and I will cut off from Ahab every male , and him that is shut up and left in Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	10	And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the plot of Jizreel , and none shall bury her . And he opened the door and fled .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	11	And Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord . And one said to him , Is all well ? why came this madman to thee ? And he said to them , Ye know the man , and his mind .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	12	And they said , It is false ! tell us now . And he said , Thus and thus spoke he to me saying , Thus saith Jehovah : I have anointed thee king over Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	13	Then they hasted and took every man his garment , and put it under him on the very stairs , and blew with trumpets , and said , Jehu is king !
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	14	And Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat , son of Nimshi , conspired against Joram . ( Now Joram kept Ramoth-Gilead , he and all Israel , because of Hazael king of Syria ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	15	and king Joram had returned to be healed in Jizreel of the wounds that the Syrians had given him , when he fought against Hazael king of Syria . ) And Jehu said , If it be your will , let not a fugitive escape out of the city to go to tell [ it ] in Jizreel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	16	And Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jizreel ; for Joram lay there . And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	17	And the watchman stood on the tower in Jizreel , and saw Jehu 's company as he came , and said , I see a company . And Joram said , Take a horseman , and send to meet them , and let him say , Is it peace ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	18	So there went one on horseback to meet him ; and he said , Thus saith the king : Is it peace ? And Jehu said , What hast thou to do with peace ? turn thee behind me . And the watchman told saying , The messenger came to them , and he does not return .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	19	And he sent out a second on horseback ; and he came to them and said , Thus saith the king : Is it peace ? And Jehu said , What hast thou to do with peace ? turn thee behind me .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	20	And the watchman told saying , He came to them , and does not return . And the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi ; for he drives furiously .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	21	Then Joram said , Make ready ! And they made ready his chariot . And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out , each in his chariot ; and they went out to meet Jehu , and met him in the plot of Naboth the Jizreelite .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	22	And it came to pass when Joram saw Jehu , that he said , Is it peace , Jehu ? And he said , What peace , so long as the fornications of thy mother Jezebel and her sorceries are so many ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	23	Then Joram turned his hand , and fled , and said to Ahaziah , Treachery , Ahaziah !
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	24	And Jehu took his bow in his hand , and smote Jehoram between his arms , and the arrow went out through his heart ; and he sank down in his chariot .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	25	And he said to Bidkar his captain , Take him up [ and ] cast him in the plot of the field of Naboth the Jizreelite . For remember how , when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father , that Jehovah laid this burden upon him :
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	26	Certainly I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth , and the blood of his sons , saith Jehovah ; and I will requite thee in this plot , saith Jehovah . And now , take [ and ] cast him into the plot , according to the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	27	When Ahaziah king of Judah saw [ that ] , he fled by the way of the garden-house . And Jehu followed after him , and said , Smite him also in his chariot . It was on the ascent of Gur , which is by Jibleam . And he fled to Megiddo , and died there .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	28	And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem , and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	29	( And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab had Ahaziah begun to reign over Judah . )
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	30	And Jehu came to Jizreel ; and Jezebel heard of it , and she put paint to her eyes , and decked her head , and looked out at the window .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	31	And when Jehu came in at the gate , she said , Is it peace , Zimri , murderer of his master ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	32	And he lifted up his face to the window , and said , Who is on my side ? who ? And two or three chamberlains looked out to him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	33	And he said , Throw her down ! And they threw her down ; and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall , and on the horses ; and he trampled on her .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	34	And he came in , and ate and drank ; and he said , Go , look , I pray you , after this cursed [ woman ] , and bury her ; for she is a king 's daughter .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	35	And they went to bury her ; but they found no more of her than the skull , and the feet , and the palms of the hands .
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	36	And they came back and told him . And he said , This is the word of Jehovah , which he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite saying , In the plot of Jizreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	9	37	and the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the open field in the plot of Jizreel , so that they shall not say , This is Jezebel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	2	And now , when this letter comes to you , seeing your master 's sons are with you , and there are with you chariots , and horses , and a fortified city , and armour ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	10	Know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of Jehovah , which Jehovah spoke concerning the house of Ahab ; for Jehovah has done that which he said through his servant Elijah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	3	look out the best and worthiest of your master 's sons , and set him on his father 's throne , and fight for your master 's house .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	4	And they were exceedingly afraid , and said , Behold , the two kings stood not before him ; and how shall we stand ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	5	And he that was over the house , and he that was over the city , and the elders , and the guardians sent to Jehu , saying , We are thy servants , and will do all that thou shalt bid us ; we will not make any one king ; do what is good in thy sight .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	6	And he wrote a letter the second time to them saying , If ye are mine , and will hearken to my voice , take the heads of the men your master 's sons , and come to me to Jizreel to-morrow at this time . Now the king 's sons , seventy persons , were with the great men of the city , who brought them up .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	7	And it came to pass when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and slaughtered seventy persons , and put their heads in baskets , and sent them to him to Jizreel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	8	And a messenger came and told him saying , They have brought the heads of the king 's sons . And he said , Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	9	And it came to pass in the morning that he went out ; and he stood , and said to all the people , Ye are righteous ! behold , I conspired against my master and killed him ; but who smote all these ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	11	And Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jizreel , and all his great men , and his acquaintances , and his priests , until he left him none remaining .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	12	And he rose up and departed , and came to Samaria . And as he was at the shepherds ' meeting-place on the way ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	13	Jehu found the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah , and said , Who are ye ? And they said , We are the brethren of Ahaziah ; and have come down to salute the children of the king , and the children of the queen .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	14	And he said , Take them alive ! And they took them alive , and slew them at the well of the meeting-place , forty-two men ; and he left not one of them remaining .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	15	And he departed thence , and found Jehonadab the son of Rechab [ coming ] to meet him ; and he greeted him , and said to him , Is thy heart right , as my heart is with thy heart ? And Jehonadab said , It is.—If it be , give [ me ] thy hand.—And he gave [ him ] his hand ; and [ Jehu ] took him up to him into the chariot ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	16	and said , Come with me , and see my zeal for Jehovah . So they made him ride in his chariot .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	17	And he came to Samaria , and smote all that remained to Ahab in Samaria , until he had destroyed him , according to the word of Jehovah which he spoke to Elijah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	18	And Jehu gathered all the people together , and said to them , Ahab served Baal a little : Jehu will serve him much .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	19	And now call me all the prophets of Baal , all his servants , and all his priests : let none be wanting ; for I have a great sacrifice [ to do ] to Baal ; whoever shall be wanting shall not live . But Jehu did it in subtilty , in order that he might bring destruction upon the servants of Baal .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	20	And Jehu said , Hallow a solemn assembly for Baal . And they proclaimed [ it ] .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	21	And Jehu sent into all Israel ; and all the servants of Baal came , so that there was not a man left that came not : and they entered into the house of Baal ; and the house of Baal was full from one end to the other .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	22	And he said to him that was over the wardrobe , Bring forth vestments for all the servants of Baal . And he brought them forth vestments .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	23	And Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Rechab entered into the house of Baal , and said to the servants of Baal , Search , and see that there be here with you none of the servants of Jehovah , but the servants of Baal only .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	24	And they entered in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings . Now Jehu appointed eighty men without , and said , He that allows any of the men to escape that I have brought into your hands , his life shall be for the life of him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	25	And it came to pass as soon as they had ended offering up the burnt-offering , that Jehu said to the couriers and to the captains , Go in , slay them ; let none come forth . And they smote them with the edge of the sword ; and the couriers and the captains cast [ them ] there . And they went to the city of the house of Baal ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	26	and brought forth the columns out of the house of Baal , and burned them ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	27	and they broke down the column of Baal , and broke down the house of Baal , and made it a draught-house to this day .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	28	Thus Jehu extirpated Baal out of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	29	Only , the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin , from them Jehu departed not : [ from ] the golden calves that were in Bethel , and that were in Dan .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	30	And Jehovah said to Jehu , Because thou hast executed well that which is right in my sight , [ and ] hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart , thy children of the fourth [ generation ] shall sit on the throne of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	31	But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Jehovah the God of Israel with all his heart ; he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam , who made Israel to sin .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	32	In those days Jehovah began to cut Israel short ; and Hazael smote them in all the borders of Israel ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	33	from the Jordan eastward , all the land of Gilead , the Gadites , and the Reubenites , and the Manassites , from Aroer , which is by the river Arnon , both Gilead and Bashan .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	34	And the rest of the acts of Jehu , and all that he did , and all his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	35	And Jehu slept with his fathers , and they buried him in Samaria : and Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	10	36	Now the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	2	But Jehosheba , the daughter of king Joram , the sister of Ahaziah , took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the king 's sons that were slain , [ and hid ] him and his nurse in the bedchamber ; and they hid him from Athaliah , so that he was not slain .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	11	And the couriers stood by the king round about , every man with his weapons in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , toward the altar and the house .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	3	And he was with her hid in the house of Jehovah six years . And Athaliah reigned over the land .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	4	And in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains of the hundreds , of the bodyguard and the couriers , and brought them to him into the house of Jehovah , and made a covenant with them , and took an oath of them in the house of Jehovah , and shewed them the king 's son .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	5	And he commanded them saying , This is the thing which ye shall do : a third part of you , that come in on the sabbath , shall be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	6	and a third part shall be at the gate of Sur ; and a third part at the gate behind the couriers ; and ye shall keep the watch of the house for a defence .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	7	And the two parts of you , all those that go forth on the sabbath , even they shall keep the watch of the house of Jehovah about the king .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	8	And ye shall encompass the king round about , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and he that comes within the ranks shall be put to death ; and ye shall be with the king when he goes out and when he comes in .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	9	And the captains of the hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded ; and they took every man his men , those that were to come in on the sabbath , with them that were to go forth on the sabbath , and they came to Jehoiada the priest .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	10	And the priest gave to the captains of the hundreds king David 's spears and shields which were in the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	12	And he brought forth the king 's son , and put the crown upon him , and [ gave him ] the testimony ; and they made him king , and anointed him ; and they clapped their hands , and said , Long live the king !
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	13	And Athaliah heard the noise of the couriers [ and ] of the people ; and she came to the people into the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	14	And she looked , and behold , the king stood on the dais , according to the custom , and the princes and the trumpeters were by the king ; and all the people of the land rejoiced , and blew with trumpets . And Athaliah rent her garments and cried , Conspiracy ! Conspiracy !
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	15	And Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds that were set over the host , and said to them , Lead her forth without the ranks ; and whosoever follows her , slay with the sword ; for the priest said , Let her not be put to death in the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	16	And they made way for her , and she went by the way by which the horses entered the king 's house , and there was she put to death .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	17	And Jehoiada made a covenant between Jehovah and the king and the people , that they should be the people of Jehovah ; and between the king and the people .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	18	Then all the people of the land went into the house of Baal , and broke it down : his altars and his images they broke in pieces completely , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars . And the priest appointed officers over the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	19	And he took the captains of the hundreds , and the bodyguard , and the couriers , and all the people of the land ; and they brought down the king from the house of Jehovah , and came by the way through the gate of the couriers into the king 's house . And he sat upon the throne of the kings .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	20	And all the people of the land rejoiced , and the city was quiet ; and they had slain Athaliah with the sword [ beside ] the king 's house .
DARBY	2%20Kings	11	21	Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign .
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	2	And Jehoash did what was right in the sight of Jehovah , all the days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	12	and to masons , and hewers of stone , and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the breaches of the house of Jehovah , and for all that had to be laid out on the house for repairs .
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	3	Only , the high places were not removed : the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places .
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	4	And Jehoash said to the priests , All the money of the hallowed things that is brought into the house of Jehovah , the money of every one that passes [ the account ] , the money at which every man is valued , [ and ] all the money that comes into any man 's heart to bring into the house of Jehovah ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	5	let the priests take it , every man of his acquaintance ; and let them repair the breaches of the house , wherever any breach is found .
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	6	And it was [ so that ] in the twenty-third year of king Jehoash , the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house .
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	7	Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest , and the priests , and said to them , Why have ye not repaired the breaches of the house ? And now receive no money of your acquaintances , but give it for the breaches of the house .
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	8	And the priests consented to receive no money of the people , and that they should only repair the breaches of the house .
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	9	And Jehoiada the priest took a chest , and bored a hole in the lid , and set it beside the altar , on the right side as one comes into the house of Jehovah ; and the priests that kept the door put into it all the money brought into the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	10	And it came to pass when they saw that there was much money in the chest , that the king 's scribe and the high priest came up , and they tied up and counted the money that was found in the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	11	And they gave the money , weighed out into the hands of them that did the work , who were appointed over the house of Jehovah ; and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders that wrought upon the house of Jehovah ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	13	However there were not made for the house of Jehovah basons of silver , knives , bowls , trumpets , nor any utensil of gold or utensil of silver , of the money that was brought [ into ] the house of Jehovah ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	14	but they gave that to the workmen , and repaired the house of Jehovah with it .
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	15	And they did not reckon with the men into whose hand they gave the money to be bestowed on workmen ; for they dealt faithfully .
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	16	The money of trespass-offerings , and the money of sin-offerings , was not brought into the house of Jehovah : it was for the priests .
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	17	Then Hazael king of Syria went up , and fought against Gath , and took it . And Hazael set his face to go up against Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	18	And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah , his fathers , kings of Judah , had dedicated , and his own hallowed things , and all the gold found in the treasures of the house of Jehovah and in the king 's house , and sent it to Hazael king of Syria ; and he went away from Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	19	And the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	20	And his servants rose up and made a conspiracy , and smote Joash in the house of Millo , at the descent of Silla .
DARBY	2%20Kings	12	21	And Jozachar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer , his servants , smote him and he died ; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David . And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	2	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah , and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin ; he departed not from them .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	13	And Joash slept with his fathers , and Jeroboam sat upon his throne ; and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	3	And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria , and into the hand of Ben-Hadad the son of Hazael , all those days .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	4	( And Jehoahaz besought Jehovah , and Jehovah hearkened to him ; for he saw the oppression of Israel , because the king of Syria oppressed them .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	5	And Jehovah gave Israel a saviour , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians ; and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as before .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	6	Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam , who made Israel to sin : they walked therein ; and there remained also the Asherah in Samaria . )
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	7	For he had left of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen , and ten chariots , and ten thousand footmen ; for the king of Syria had destroyed them , and had made them like the dust by threshing .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	8	And the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz , and all that he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	9	And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in Samaria ; and Joash his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	10	In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria , for sixteen years .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	11	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah ; he departed not from any of the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin : he walked therein .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	12	And the rest of the acts of Joash , and all that he did , and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	14	And Elisha fell sick of his sickness in which he died . And Joash the king of Israel came down to him , and wept over his face , and said , My father , my father ! the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof !
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	15	And Elisha said to him , Take bow and arrows . And he took a bow and arrows .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	16	And he said to the king of Israel , Put thy hand upon the bow . And he put his hand [ upon it ] ; and Elisha put his hands upon the king 's hands ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	17	and said , Open the window eastward . And he opened [ it ] . And Elisha said , Shoot . And he shot . And he said , An arrow of Jehovah 's deliverance , even an arrow of deliverance from the Syrians ; and thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek , till thou hast consumed [ them ] .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	18	And he said , Take the arrows . And he took [ them ] . And he said to the king of Israel , Smite upon the ground . And he smote thrice , and stayed .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	19	And the man of God was wroth with him , and said , Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times ; then wouldest thou have smitten the Syrians till thou hadst consumed [ them ] ; whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	20	And Elisha died , and they buried him . And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	21	And it came to pass as they were burying a man , that behold , they saw the band , and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha ; and the man went [ down ] , and touched the bones of Elisha , and he revived , and stood upon his feet .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	22	And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	23	And Jehovah was gracious to them , and had compassion on them , and had respect to them , because of his covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ; and he would not destroy them , neither did he cast them from his presence up to that time .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	24	And Hazael king of Syria died , and Ben-Hadad his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	13	25	And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Ben-Hadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father in the war . Three times did Joash beat him , and recovered the cities of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	2	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	14	And he took all the gold and the silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of Jehovah , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and hostages , and returned to Samaria .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	3	And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah , yet not like David his father : he did according to all that Joash his father had done .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	4	Only , the high places were not removed : the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	5	And it came to pass when the kingdom was established in his hand , that he slew his servants who had smitten the king his father .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	6	But the children of those that smote [ him ] he did not put to death ; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses , wherein Jehovah commanded saying , The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers ; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	7	He smote of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand , and took Sela in the war , and called the name of it Joktheel to this day .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz , son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , Come , let us look one another in the face .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	9	And Jehoash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah , saying , The thorn-bush that is in Lebanon sent to the cedar that is in Lebanon , saying , Give thy daughter to my son as wife ; and there passed by the wild beast that is in Lebanon , and trode down the thorn-bush .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	10	Thou hast indeed smitten Edom , and thy heart has lifted thee up : boast thyself , and abide at home ; for why shouldest thou contend with misfortune , that thou shouldest fall , thou , and Judah with thee ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	11	But Amaziah would not hear . And Jehoash king of Israel went up ; and they looked one another in the face , he and Amaziah king of Judah , at Beth-shemesh , which is in Judah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	12	And Judah was routed before Israel ; and they fled every man to his tent .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	13	And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Jehoash son of Ahaziah , at Beth-shemesh , and came to Jerusalem , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner-gate , four hundred cubits .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	15	And the rest of the acts of Jehoash , what he did , and his might , and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	16	And Jehoash slept with his fathers , and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel ; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	17	And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz , king of Israel , fifteen years .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	18	And the rest of the acts of Amaziah , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	19	And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem ; and he fled to Lachish ; and they sent after him to Lachish , and slew him there .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	20	And they brought him on horses , and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers , in the city of David .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	21	And all the people of Judah took Azariah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king instead of his father Amaziah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	22	It was he that built Elath , and restored it to Judah , after the king slept with his fathers .

DARBY	2%20Kings	14	24	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah : he departed not from any of the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	25	He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath as far as the sea of the plain , according to the word of Jehovah the God of Israel , which he had spoken through his servant Jonah the prophet , the son of Amittai , who was of Gath-Hepher .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	26	For Jehovah saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter ; and that there was not any shut up , nor any left , nor any helper for Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	27	And Jehovah had not said that he would blot out the name of Israel from under the heavens ; and he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash .
DARBY	2%20Kings	14	28	And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam , and all that he did , and his might , how he warred , and how he recovered for Israel that [ which had belonged ] to Judah in Damascus and in Hamath , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?

DARBY	2%20Kings	15	2	He was sixteen years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	15	And the rest of the acts of Shallum , and his conspiracy which he made , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	3	And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah , according to all that his father Amaziah had done .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	4	Only , the high places were not removed : the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	5	And Jehovah smote the king , so that he was a leper to the day of his death , and dwelt in a separate house . And Jotham the king 's son was over the house , judging the people of the land .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	6	And the rest of the acts of Azariah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?

DARBY	2%20Kings	15	16	Then Menahem smote Tiphsah , and all that were therein , and its territory from Tirzah , because they did not open [ to him ] ; and he smote [ it ] : all the women in it that were with child he ripped up .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	17	In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah , Menahem the son of Gadi began to reign over Israel , for ten years , in Samaria .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	18	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah : he departed not , all his days , from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	19	Pul the king of Assyria came against the land ; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver , that his hand might be with him to establish the kingdom in his hand .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	20	And Menahem exacted the money of Israel , of all those who were wealthy , of each man fifty shekels of silver , to give to the king of Assyria . And the king of Assyria turned back , and stayed not there in the land .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	21	And the rest of the acts of Menahem , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	22	And Menahem slept with his fathers ; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	23	In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah , Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria , for two years .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	24	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	25	And Pekah the son of Remaliah , his captain , conspired against him , and smote him in Samaria , in the fortress of the king 's house , with Argob and Arieh , and with him fifty men of the Gileadites ; and he slew him , and reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	26	And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah , and all that he did , behold , they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel .

DARBY	2%20Kings	15	33	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Jerusha , the daughter of Zadok .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	34	And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah : he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	35	Only , the high places were not removed : the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places . It was he who built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	36	And the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	37	In those days Jehovah began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah the son of Remaliah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	15	38	And Jotham slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father ; and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	2	Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . And he did not what was right in the sight of Jehovah his God , like David his father ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	16	And Urijah the priest did according to all that king Ahaz had commanded .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	3	but walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and even caused his son to pass through the fire , according to the abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from before the children of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	4	And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	5	Then Rezin the king of Syria , and Pekah son of Remaliah , the king of Israel , came up to Jerusalem to battle ; and they besieged Ahaz , but were unable to conquer him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	6	At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria , and drove the Jews from Elath ; and the Syrians came to Elath , and dwelt there to this day .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	7	And Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria , saying , I am thy servant and thy son : come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , who have risen up against me .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	8	And Ahaz took the silver and the gold that was found in the house of Jehovah , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it [ as ] a present to the king of Assyria .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	9	And the king of Assyria hearkened to him ; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus , and took it , and carried it captive to Kir , and put Rezin to death .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	10	And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria ; and he saw the altar that was at Damascus , and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the form of the altar , and the pattern of it , according to all its workmanship .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	11	And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus ; thus Urijah the priest made [ it ] , against king Ahaz came from Damascus .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	12	And when the king came from Damascus , the king saw the altar ; and the king approached to the altar , and offered upon it .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	13	And he burned his burnt-offering and his oblation , and poured out his drink-offering , and sprinkled the blood of his peace-offering upon the altar .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	14	And the brazen altar which was before Jehovah , he brought forward from the forefront of the house , from between [ his ] altar and the house of Jehovah , and put it by the side of [ his ] altar on the north .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	15	And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest saying , Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt-offering , and the evening oblation , and the king 's burnt-offering , and his oblation , and the burnt-offering of all the people of the land , and their oblation , and their drink-offerings ; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt-offerings , and all the blood of the sacrifices ; and the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire [ by ] .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	17	And king Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases , and removed the lavers from off them ; and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it , and put it upon a stone pavement .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	18	And the covered way of the sabbath that they had built in the house , and the king 's entry outside , he turned from the house of Jehovah on account of the king of Assyria .
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	19	And the rest of the acts of Ahaz , what he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	16	20	And Ahaz slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David ; and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	2	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah , but not as the kings of Israel that had been before him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	17	and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used divination and enchantments , and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of Jehovah , to provoke him to anger .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	3	Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria , and Hoshea became his servant , and tendered him presents .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	4	But the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea ; for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt , and sent up no present to the king of Assyria as [ he had done ] from year to year . And the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	5	And the king of Assyria overran the whole land , and went up against Samaria , and besieged it three years .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	6	In the ninth year of Hoshea , the king of Assyria took Samaria , and carried Israel away into Assyria , and placed them in Halah and by the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	7	And so it was , because the children of Israel had sinned against Jehovah their God , who had brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	8	and they walked in the statutes of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they had made .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	9	And the children of Israel did secretly against Jehovah their God things that were not right ; and they built them high places in all their cities , from the watchmen 's tower to the fortified city .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	10	And they set them up columns and Asherahs on every high hill and under every green tree ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	11	and there they burned incense on all the high places , as did the nations that Jehovah had carried away from before them , and they wrought wicked things to provoke Jehovah to anger ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	12	and they served idols , as to which Jehovah had said to them , Ye shall not do this thing .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	13	And Jehovah testified against Israel and against Judah , by all the prophets , all the seers , saying , Turn from your evil ways , and keep my commandments , my statutes , according to all the law which I commanded your fathers , and which I sent to you through my servants the prophets .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	14	But they would not hear , and hardened their necks , like to the neck of their fathers , who did not believe in Jehovah their God .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	15	And they rejected his statutes , and his covenant which he had made with their fathers , and his testimonies which he had testified unto them ; and they followed vanity and became vain , and [ went ] after the nations that were round about them , concerning whom Jehovah had charged them that they should not do like them .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	16	And they forsook all the commandments of Jehovah their God , and made them molten images , two calves , and made an Asherah , and worshipped all the host of the heavens , and served Baal ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	18	Therefore Jehovah was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there remained but the tribe of Judah only .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	19	Also Judah kept not the commandments of Jehovah their God , but walked in the statutes of Israel which they had made .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	20	And Jehovah rejected all the seed of Israel ; and afflicted them , and delivered them into the hand of spoilers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	21	For Israel had rent [ the kingdom ] from the house of David ; and they had made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king ; and Jeroboam violently turned Israel from following Jehovah , and made them sin a great sin .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	22	And the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did ; they did not depart from them :
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	23	until Jehovah had removed Israel out of his sight , as he had said through all his servants the prophets ; and Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria , unto this day .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	24	And the king of Assyria brought [ people ] from Babylon , and from Cuthah , and from Avva , and from Hamath , and from Sepharvaim , and made them dwell in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel ; and they possessed Samaria , and dwelt in its cities .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	25	And so it was , at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they feared not Jehovah ; and Jehovah sent lions among them , which killed [ some ] of them .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	26	And they spoke to the king of Assyria saying , The nations that thou hast removed and made to dwell in the cities of Samaria know not the manner of the god of the land ; therefore he has sent lions among them , and behold , they slay them , because they know not the manner of the god of the land .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	27	And the king of Assyria commanded saying , Carry thither one of the priests whom ye have brought away from thence ; and let them go and abide there , and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	28	Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and abode in Bethel , and taught them how they should fear Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	29	And every nation made gods of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places that the Samaritans had made , every nation in their cities in which they dwelt .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	30	And the people of Babylon made Succoth-benoth , and the people of Cuth made Nergal , and the people of Hamath made Ashima ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	31	and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak , and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	32	So they feared Jehovah , and made to themselves from all classes of them priests of the high places , who offered [ sacrifices ] for them in the houses of the high places .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	33	They feared Jehovah , and served their own gods after the manner of the nations , whence they had been carried away .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	34	To this day they do after their former customs : they fear not Jehovah , neither do they after their statutes or after their ordinances , nor after the law and commandment that Jehovah commanded the sons of Jacob , whom he named Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	35	And Jehovah had made a covenant with them , and charged them saying , Ye shall not fear other gods , nor bow down yourselves to them , nor serve them , nor sacrifice to them ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	36	but Jehovah alone , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched-out arm , him shall ye fear , and him shall ye worship , and to him shall ye do sacrifice .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	37	And the statutes and the ordinances and the law , and the commandment which he wrote for you , ye shall observe to do for evermore ; and ye shall not fear other gods .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	38	And ye shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you , neither shall ye fear other gods ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	39	but ye shall fear Jehovah your God , and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	40	And they did not hearken , but did after their former customs .
DARBY	2%20Kings	17	41	And these nations feared Jehovah , and served their graven images , both their children and their children 's children : as did their fathers , so do they , unto this day .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	2	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Abi , daughter of Zechariah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	18	And they called to the king . Then came forth to them Eliakim the son of Hilkijah , who was over the household , and Shebnah the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph , the chronicler .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	3	And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah , according to all that David his father had done .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	4	He removed the high places , and broke the columns , and cut down the Asherahs , and broke in pieces the serpent of brass that Moses had made ; for to those days the children of Israel burned incense to it : and he called it Nehushtan .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	5	He trusted in Jehovah the God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah , nor [ among any ] that were before him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	6	And he clave to Jehovah , and did not turn aside from following him , but kept his commandments , which Jehovah commanded Moses .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	7	And Jehovah was with him ; he prospered whithersoever he went forth . And he rebelled against the king of Assyria , and served him not .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	8	He smote the Philistines unto Gazah and its borders , from the watchmen 's tower to the fortified city .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	9	And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah , which was the seventh year of Hoshea the son of Elah , king of Israel , [ that ] Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and besieged it .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	10	And at the end of three years they took it ; in the sixth year of Hezekiah , that is , the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel , Samaria was taken .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	11	And the king of Assyria carried away Israel to Assyria , and settled them in Halah and by the Habor , the river of Gozan , and in the cities of the Medes ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	12	because they hearkened not to the voice of Jehovah their God , but transgressed his covenant , all that Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded ; and they would not hear nor do it .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	13	And in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah , and took them .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	14	And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish , saying , I have sinned ; retire from me : I will bear what thou layest upon me . And the king of Assyria laid upon Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	15	And Hezekiah gave all the silver that was found in the house of Jehovah , and in the treasures of the king 's house .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	16	At that time Hezekiah stripped the doors of the temple of Jehovah , and the posts that Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid , and gave them to the king of Assyria .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	17	And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rab-shakeh from Lachish , with a strong force , against king Hezekiah , to Jerusalem . And they went up and came to Jerusalem . And when they were come up , they came and stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool , which is on the highway of the fuller 's field .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	19	And Rab-shakeh said to them , Say now to Hezekiah , Thus says the great king , the king of Assyria : What confidence is this wherein thou trustest ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	20	Thou sayest—but it is a word of the lips—There is counsel and strength for war . Now on whom dost thou rely , that thou hast revolted against me ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	21	Now behold , thou reliest upon the staff of that broken reed , upon Egypt , on which if a man lean , it goes into his hand and pierces it : so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that rely upon him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	22	And if ye say to me , We rely upon Jehovah our God : is it not he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has removed , saying to Judah and Jerusalem , Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	23	And now , engage , I pray thee , with my master the king of Assyria , and I will give thee two thousand horses , if thou canst set the riders upon them .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	24	How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants ? And thou reliest upon Egypt for chariots and for horsemen !
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	25	Am I now come up without Jehovah against this place to destroy it ? Jehovah said to me , Go up against this land and destroy it .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	26	And Eliakim the son of Hilkijah , and Shebnah and Joah said to Rab-shakeh , Speak , we pray thee , to thy servants in Syriac , for we understand it , and talk not with us in the Jewish [ language ] in the ears of the people that are on the wall .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	27	And Rab-shakeh said to them , Is it to thy master and to thee that my master sent me to speak these words ? Is it not to the men that sit on the wall , that they may eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	28	And Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish [ language ] , and spoke and said , Hear the word of the great king , the king of Assyria !
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	29	Thus says the king : Let not Hezekiah deceive you ; for he will not be able to deliver you out of the [ king 's ] hand .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	30	Neither let Hezekiah make you rely upon Jehovah , saying , Jehovah will certainly deliver us , and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	31	Hearken not to Hezekiah ; for thus says the king of Assyria : Make peace with me , and come out to me ; and eat every one of his vine and every one of his fig-tree , and drink every one the waters of his own cistern ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	32	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land of corn and wine , a land of bread and vineyards , a land of olive-trees and of honey , that ye may live and not die ; and hearken not to Hezekiah , when he persuades you , saying , Jehovah will deliver us .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	33	Have any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	34	Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad ? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivvah ? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	35	Which are they among all the gods of the countries , who have delivered their country out of my hand , that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	36	But the people were silent and answered him not a word ; for the king 's command was , saying , Answer him not .
DARBY	2%20Kings	18	37	And Eliakim the son of Hilkijah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph , the chronicler , came to Hezekiah with their garments rent , and told him the words of Rab-shakeh .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	2	And he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	19	And now , Jehovah our God , I beseech thee , save us out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou , Jehovah , art God , thou only .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	3	And they said to him , Thus says Hezekiah : This day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of reviling ; for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	4	It may be Jehovah thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh , whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God ; and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God has heard . Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that is left .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	5	And the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	6	And Isaiah said to them , Thus shall ye say to your master : Thus saith Jehovah : Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard , wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	7	Behold , I will put a spirit into him , and he shall hear tidings , and shall return to his own land ; and I will make him to fall by the sword in his own land .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	8	And Rab-shakeh returned , and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah ; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	9	And he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , Behold , he has come forth to make war with thee . And he sent messengers again to Hezekiah , saying ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	10	Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah saying : Let not thy God , upon whom thou reliest , deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	11	Behold , thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all countries , destroying them utterly ; and shalt thou be delivered ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	12	Have the gods of the nations which my fathers have destroyed delivered them : Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden that were in Thelassar ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	13	Where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arpad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivvah ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	14	And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it ; and Hezekiah went up into the house of Jehovah , and spread it before Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	15	And Hezekiah prayed before Jehovah and said , Jehovah , God of Israel , who sittest [ between ] the cherubim , thou , the Same , thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth : thou hast made the heavens and the earth .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	16	Incline thine ear , Jehovah , and hear ; open , Jehovah , thine eyes , and see ; and hear the words of Sennacherib , who hath sent him to reproach the living God .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	17	Of a truth , Jehovah , the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	18	and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone ; therefore have they destroyed them .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	20	And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah , saying , Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel : That which thou hast prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	21	This is the word that Jehovah has spoken against him : The virgin-daughter of Zion despiseth thee , laugheth thee to scorn ; The daughter of Jerusalem shaketh her head at thee .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	22	Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted the voice ? Against the Holy one of Israel hast thou lifted up thine eyes on high .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	23	By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord , and hast said , With the multitude of my chariots have I come up To the height of the mountain , to the recesses of Lebanon , And I will cut down its tall cedars , the choice of its cypresses ; And I will enter into its furthest lodging-place , [ into ] the forest of its fruitful field .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	24	I have digged , and have drunk strange waters , And with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the streams of Matsor .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	25	Hast thou not heard long ago that I have done it ? And that from ancient days I formed it ? Now have I brought it to pass , that thou shouldest lay waste fortified cities [ into ] ruinous heaps .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	26	And their inhabitants were powerless , They were dismayed and put to shame ; They were [ as ] the growing grass , and [ as ] the green herb , [ As ] the grass on the housetops , and grain blighted before it be grown up .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	27	But I know thine abode , and thy going out , and thy coming in , And thy raging against me .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	28	Because thy raging against me and thine arrogance is come up into mine ears , I will put my ring in thy nose , and my bridle in thy lips , And I will make thee go back by the way by which thou camest .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	29	And this [ shall be ] the sign unto thee : They shall eat this year such as groweth of itself , And in the second year that which springeth of the same ; But in the third year sow ye and reap , And plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	30	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah Shall again take root downward , and bear fruit upward ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	31	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , And out of mount Zion they that escape : The zeal of Jehovah [ of hosts ] shall do this .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	32	Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria : He shall not come into this city , Nor shoot an arrow there , Nor come before it with shield , Nor cast a bank against it .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	33	By the way that he came , by the same shall he return , And shall not come into this city , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	34	And I will defend this city , to save it , For mine own sake , and for my servant David 's sake .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	35	And it came to pass that night , that an angel of Jehovah went forth , and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand . And when they arose early in the morning , behold , they were all dead bodies .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	36	And Sennacherib king of Assyria departed , and went and returned , and abode at Nineveh .
DARBY	2%20Kings	19	37	And it came to pass , as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer [ his sons ] smote him with the sword ; and they escaped into the land of Ararat . And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	2	And he turned his face to the wall , and prayed to Jehovah saying ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	20	And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah , and all his might , and how he made the pool and the aqueduct , and brought the water into the city , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	3	Ah ! Jehovah , remember , I beseech thee , how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done what is good in thy sight . And Hezekiah wept much .
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	4	And it came to pass before Isaiah had gone out into the middle city that the word of Jehovah came to him saying ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	5	Return , and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people , Thus saith Jehovah , the God of David thy father : I have heard thy prayer , I have seen thy tears ; behold , I will heal thee : on the third day thou shalt go up to the house of Jehovah ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	6	and I will add to thy days fifteen years ; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria , and I will defend this city for mine own sake , and for my servant David 's sake .
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	7	And Isaiah said , Take a cake of figs . And they took and laid it on the boil , and he recovered .
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	8	And Hezekiah said to Isaiah , What [ shall be ] the sign that Jehovah will heal me , and that I shall go up into the house of Jehovah the third day ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	9	And Isaiah said , This [ shall be ] the sign to thee from Jehovah , that Jehovah will do the thing that he hath spoken : shall the shadow go forward ten degrees , or go back ten degrees ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	10	And Hezekiah said , It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees : no , but let the shadow return backward ten degrees .
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	11	And Isaiah the prophet cried to Jehovah , and he brought the shadow back on the degrees by which it had gone down on the dial of Ahaz , ten degrees backward .
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	12	At that time Berodach-Baladan , the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent a letter and a present to Hezekiah , for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick .
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	13	And Hezekiah hearkened to them , and shewed them all his treasure-house , the silver and the gold , and the spices and the fine oil , and all the house of his armour , and all that was found among his treasures : there was nothing in his house , nor in all his dominion , that Hezekiah did not shew them .
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	14	Then came the prophet Isaiah to king Hezekiah and said to him , What said these men ? and from whence came they to thee ? And Hezekiah said , They came from a far country , from Babylon .
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	15	And he said , What have they seen in thy house ? And Hezekiah said , All that is in my house have they seen : there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewn them .
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	16	And Isaiah said to Hezekiah , Hear the word of Jehovah :
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	17	Behold , days come that all that is in thy house , and what thy fathers have laid up until this day , shall be carried to Babylon ; nothing shall be left , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	18	And of thy sons that shall issue from thee , whom thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be chamberlains in the palace of the king of Babylon .
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	19	And Hezekiah said to Isaiah , Good is the word of Jehovah which thou hast spoken . And he said , Is it not so ? if only there shall be peace and truth in my days !
DARBY	2%20Kings	20	21	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers ; and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	2	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah , like the abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from before the children of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	21	and he walked in all the way that his father had walked in , and served the idols that his father had served , and worshipped them ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	3	And he built again the high places that Hezekiah his father had destroyed ; and he reared up altars to Baal and made an Asherah , as did Ahab king of Israel ; and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served them .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	4	And he built altars in the house of Jehovah , of which Jehovah had said , In Jerusalem will I put my name .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	5	And he built altars to all the host of heaven in both courts of the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	6	And he caused his son to pass through the fire , and used magic and divination , and appointed necromancers and soothsayers : he wrought evil beyond measure in the sight of Jehovah , to provoke him to anger .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	7	And he set the graven image of the Asherah that he had made , in the house of which Jehovah had said to David and to Solomon his son , In this house , and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel , will I put my name for ever ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	8	neither will I any more cause the foot of Israel to wander away from the land that I gave their fathers ; if they will only take heed to do according to all that I have commanded them , and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	9	But they would not hearken , and Manasseh led them astray to do more evil than the nations that Jehovah had destroyed from before the children of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	10	And Jehovah spoke by his servants the prophets saying ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	11	Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations , and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did , who were before him , and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	12	therefore thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel : Behold , I will bring evil upon Jerusalem and Judah , that whosoever heareth of it , both his ears shall tingle .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	13	And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria , and the plummet of the house of Ahab , and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipeth a pan , wiping it and turning it upside down .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	14	And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance , and deliver them into the hand of their enemies ; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	15	because they have done evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt even to this day .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	16	And Manasseh shed very much innocent blood , till he had filled Jerusalem [ with it ] from one end to another ; beside his sin with which he made Judah to sin , in doing evil in the sight of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	17	And the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and all that he did , and his sin which he sinned , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	18	And Manasseh slept with his fathers , and was buried in the garden of his own house , in the garden of Uzza ; and Amon his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	19	Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Meshullemeth , daughter of Haruz of Jotbah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	20	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah , as Manasseh his father had done ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	22	and he forsook Jehovah the God of his fathers , and walked not in the way of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	23	And the servants of Amon conspired against him , and slew the king in his own house .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	24	But the people of the land smote all them that had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	25	And the rest of the acts of Amon , what he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	21	26	And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza ; and Josiah his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	2	And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand nor to the left .
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	22	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Jedidah , daughter of Adaiah of Bozcath .
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	3	And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , [ that ] the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , son of Meshullam , the scribe , to the house of Jehovah , saying ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	4	Go up to Hilkijah the high priest , that he may sum up the money which is brought into the house of Jehovah , which the doorkeepers have gathered of the people ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	5	and let them give it into the hand of them that do the work , that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah ; and let them give it to those that do the work in the house of Jehovah , to repair the breaches of the house ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	6	to the carpenters and the builders and the masons , and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house .
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	7	But no reckoning was made with them of the money that was given into their hand , because they dealt faithfully .
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	8	And Hilkijah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe , I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah . And Hilkijah gave the book to Shaphan , and he read it .
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	9	And Shaphan the scribe came to the king , and brought the king word again and said , Thy servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work , that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	10	And Shaphan the scribe informed the king saying , Hilkijah the priest has given me a book . And Shaphan read it before the king .
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	11	And it came to pass when the king heard the words of the book of the law , that he rent his garments .
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	12	And the king commanded Hilkijah the priest , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Achbor the son of Micaiah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah a servant of the king , saying ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	13	Go , inquire of Jehovah for me , and for the people , and for all Judah , concerning the words of this book which is found ; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is kindled against us , because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this book , to do according to all that is written [ there ] for us .
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	14	And Hilkijah the priest , and Ahikam , and Achbor , and Shaphan , and Asaiah , went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah , son of Harhas , keeper of the wardrobe : now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter [ of the town ] ; and they spoke with her .
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	15	And she said to them , Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel : Tell the man that sent you to me ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	16	Thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof , all the words of the book that the king of Judah hath read .
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	17	Because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands , therefore my fury is kindled against this place , and shall not be quenched .
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	18	But to the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of Jehovah , thus shall ye say to him : Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel touching the words which thou hast heard :
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	19	Because thy heart was tender , and thou didst humble thyself before Jehovah , when thou heardest what I spoke against this place and against the inhabitants thereof , that they should become a desolation and a curse , and didst rend thy garments and weep before me , I also have heard [ thee ] , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	22	20	Therefore , behold , I will gather thee unto thy fathers , and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace ; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil that I will bring upon this place . And they brought the king word again .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	2	And the king went up into the house of Jehovah , and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him , and the priests and the prophets , and all the people , both small and great ; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	23	but in the eighteenth year of king Josiah was this passover holden to Jehovah in Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	3	And the king stood on the dais , and made a covenant before Jehovah , to walk after Jehovah , and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all [ his ] heart , and with all [ his ] soul , to establish the words of this covenant that are written in this book . And all the people stood to the covenant .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	4	And the king commanded Hilkijah the high priest , and the priests of the second order , and the doorkeepers , to bring forth out of the temple of Jehovah all the vessels that had been made for Baal , and for the Asherah , and for all the host of the heavens ; and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron , and carried the ashes of them to Bethel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	5	And he abolished the idolatrous priests , whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense on the high places in the cities of Judah , and the environs of Jerusalem ; and them that burned incense to Baal , to the sun , and to the moon , and to the constellations , and to all the host of heaven .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	6	And he brought out the Asherah from the house of Jehovah , outside Jerusalem , to the torrent of Kidron , and burned it at the torrent of Kidron , and stamped it small to powder , and cast the powder upon the graves of the children of the people .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	7	And he broke down the houses of the sodomites , which were in the house of Jehovah , where the women wove tents for the Asherah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	8	And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah , and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense , from Geba even to Beer-sheba ; and he broke down the high places of the gates , those at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city , [ and ] those on the left hand of any [ going in ] at the gate of the city .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	9	Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of Jehovah in Jerusalem , but they ate of the unleavened bread among their brethren .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	10	And he defiled Topheth , which is in the valley of the sons of Hinnom , that no man might cause his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	11	And he abolished the horses that the kings of Judah had appointed to the sun at the entrance of the house of Jehovah , by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain , which was in the suburbs , and burned the chariots of the sun , with fire .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	12	And the king broke down the altars that were on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz , which the kings of Judah had made , and the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of Jehovah , and he shattered them , [ removing them ] from thence , and cast the powder of them into the torrent of Kidron .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	13	And the high places that were before Jerusalem , which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption , which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians , and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites , and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon , did the king defile .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	14	And he broke in pieces the columns , and cut down the Asherahs , and filled their place with the bones of men .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	15	Moreover the altar that was at Bethel , the high place that Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who caused Israel to sin , had made , both that altar and the high place he broke down ; and burned the high place , stamped it small to powder , and burned the Asherah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	16	And Josiah turned himself , and saw the sepulchres that were there on the mount ; and he sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres , and burned [ them ] upon the altar , and defiled it , according to the word of Jehovah , that the man of God had proclaimed , who proclaimed these things .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	17	Then he said , What tombstone is that which I see ? And the men of the city told him , It is the sepulchre of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which thou hast done against the altar of Bethel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	18	And he said , Let him alone ; let no man move his bones . And they saved his bones , with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	19	And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria , which the kings of Israel had made to provoke [ Jehovah ] to anger , Josiah removed , and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	20	And he sacrificed upon the altars all the priests of the high places that were there , and burned men 's bones upon them . And he returned to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	21	And the king commanded all the people saying , Hold the passover to Jehovah your God , as it is written in this book of the covenant .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	22	For there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Judah ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	24	Moreover the necromancers and the soothsayers , and the teraphim and the idols , and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem , Josiah took away , that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkijah the priest had found in the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	25	And before him there had been no king like him that turned to Jehovah with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might , according to all the law of Moses ; neither after him arose there his like .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	26	But Jehovah turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath , wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah , because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	27	And Jehovah said , I will remove Judah also out of my sight , as I have removed Israel , and will reject this city Jerusalem which I have chosen , and the house of which I said , My name shall be there .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	28	And the rest of the acts of Josiah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	29	In his days Pharaoh-Nechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates ; and king Josiah went against him ; but [ Nechoh ] slew him at Megiddo , when he had seen him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	30	And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo , and brought him to Jerusalem , and buried him in his own sepulchre . And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah , and anointed him , and made him king in his father 's stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	31	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Hamutal , daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	32	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah , according to all that his fathers had done .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	33	And Pharaoh-Nechoh had him bound at Riblah in the land of Hamath , that he might not reign in Jerusalem ; and laid a tribute upon the land of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	34	And Pharaoh-Nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king instead of Josiah his father , and changed his name to Jehoiakim . And he took Jehoahaz ; and he came to Egypt , and died there .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	35	And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh ; but he laid a proportional tax on the land to give the money according to the command of Pharaoh : he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land , of every one according to his estimation , to give it to Pharaoh-Nechoh .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	36	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Zebuddah , daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	23	37	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah , according to all that his fathers had done .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	2	And Jehovah sent against him the bands of the Chaldeans , and the bands of the Syrians , and the bands of the Moabites , and the bands of the children of Ammon , and sent them against Judah to destroy it , according to the word of Jehovah , which he spoke through his servants the prophets .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	24	In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up , and Jehoiakim was his servant three years ; then he turned and rebelled against him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	3	Verily , at the commandment of Jehovah it came to pass against Judah , that they should be removed out of his sight , for the sins of Manasseh , according to all that he had done ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	4	and also [ because of ] the innocent blood that he had shed ; for he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood , and Jehovah would not pardon .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	5	And the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	6	And Jehoiakim slept with his fathers , and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	7	And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land , for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt , from the torrent of Egypt to the river Euphrates .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Nehushta , daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	9	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah , according to all that his father had done .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	10	At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem , and the city was besieged .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	11	And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city , while his servants were besieging it .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	12	And Jehoiachin king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his princes , and his chamberlains ; and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	13	And he brought out thence all the treasures of the house of Jehovah , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold that Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of Jehovah , as Jehovah had said .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	14	And he carried away all Jerusalem , and all the princes , and all the mighty men of valour , ten thousand captives , and all the craftsmen and smiths : none remained but the poorest sort of the people of the land .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	15	And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon , and the king 's mother , and the king 's wives , and his chamberlains , and the mighty of the land , he led into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	16	and all the men of valour , seven thousand , and the craftsmen and smiths a thousand , all strong men apt for war , and the king of Babylon brought them captive to Babylon .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	17	And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his uncle king in his stead , and changed his name to Zedekiah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	18	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Hamutal , daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	19	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
DARBY	2%20Kings	24	20	For , because the anger of Jehovah was against Jerusalem and against Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence , Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	2	And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	25	And it came to pass in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , the son of Elishama , of the royal seed , came , and ten men with him , and smote Gedaliah , that he died , and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	3	On the ninth of the [ fourth ] month the famine prevailed in the city , and there was no bread for the people of the land .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	4	And the city was broken into ; and all the men of war [ fled ] by night , by the way of the gate between the two walls , which [ leads ] to the king 's garden ( now the Chaldeans were by the city round about ) ; and they went the way toward the plain .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	5	And the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook him in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	6	And they took the king , and brought him up to the king of Babylon unto Riblah ; and they pronounced judgment upon him ,
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	7	and slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him with chains of brass , and carried him to Babylon .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	8	And in the fifth month , on the seventh of the month , which was in the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , Nebuzar-adan , captain of the body-guard , servant of the king of Babylon , came unto Jerusalem ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	9	and he burned the house of Jehovah , and the king 's house , and all the houses of Jerusalem ; and every great [ man 's ] house he burned with fire .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	10	And all the army of the Chaldeans that were with the captain of the body-guard broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	11	And Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard carried away captive the rest of the people that were left in the city , and the deserters that had deserted to the king of Babylon , and the rest of the multitude .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	12	But the captain of the body-guard left of the poor of the land for vinedressers and husbandmen .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	13	And the brazen pillars that were in the house of Jehovah , and the bases , and the brazen sea that was in the house of Jehovah , the Chaldeans broke in pieces , and carried the brass thereof to Babylon .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	14	The cauldrons also and the shovels and the knives and the cups , and all the vessels of copper wherewith they ministered , they took away .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	15	And the censers and the bowls , that which was of gold in gold , and that which was of silver in silver , the captain of the body-guard took away .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	16	The two pillars , the one sea , and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah : for the brass of all these vessels there was no weight .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	17	The height of one pillar was eighteen cubits , and the capital upon it was brass , and the height of the capital three cubits ; and the network and the pomegranates , upon the capital round about , all of brass : and similarly for the second pillar with the network .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	18	And the captain of the body-guard took Seraiah the high priest , and Zephaniah the second priest , and the three doorkeepers .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	19	And out of the city he took a chamberlain that was set over the men of war , and five men of them that were in the king 's presence , who were found in the city , and the scribe of the captain of the host , who enrolled the people of the land ; and sixty men of the people of the land that were found in the city .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	20	And Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	21	and the king of Babylon smote them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his land .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	22	And [ as for ] the people that remained in the land of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left behind , over them he appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the son of Shaphan .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	23	And all the captains of the forces , they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah , and they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , namely , Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan the son of Kareah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite , and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite , they and their men .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	24	And Gedaliah swore unto them and to their men , and said to them , Fear not to be servants of the Chaldeans : dwell in the land , and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	26	And all the people , both small and great , and the captains of the forces , arose and came to Egypt ; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	27	And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah , in the twelfth month , on the twenty-seventh of the month , [ that ] Evil-Merodach king of Babylon , in the year that he began to reign , lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	28	and he spoke kindly to him , and set his seat above the seat of the kings that were with him in Babylon .
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	29	And he changed his prison garments ; and he ate bread before him continually all the days of his life ;
DARBY	2%20Kings	25	30	and his allowance was a continual allowance given him by the king , every day a portion , all the days of his life .

DARBY	1%20Chronicles	11	19	And he said , My God forbid it me , that I should do this thing ! should I drink the blood of these men [ who went ] at the risk of their lives ? for at the risk of their lives they brought it . Therefore he would not drink it . These things did the three mighty men .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	11	20	And Abishai the brother of Joab , he was the chief of three ; and he brandished his spear against three hundred and slew them ; and he had a name among the three .

DARBY	1%20Chronicles	11	23	He also smote the Egyptian , a man of stature , five cubits high : and in the Egyptian 's hand was a spear like a weaver 's beam ; and he went down to him with a staff , and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian 's hand , and slew him with his own spear .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	11	24	These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and he had a name among the three mighty men .

DARBY	1%20Chronicles	13	3	and let us bring again the ark of our God to us ; for we inquired not of it in the days of Saul .

DARBY	1%20Chronicles	13	9	And when they came to the threshing-floor of Chidon , Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark ; for the oxen had stumbled .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	13	10	And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzza , and he smote him , because he had put forth his hand to the ark ; and there he died before God .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	13	11	And David was indignant ; for Jehovah had made a breach upon Uzza ; and he called that place Perez-Uzza to this day .

DARBY	1%20Chronicles	14	9	And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	14	10	And David inquired of God saying , Shall I go up against the Philistines , and wilt thou give them into my hand ? And Jehovah said to him , Go up ; and I will give them into thy hand .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	14	11	And they came up to Baal-perazim , and David smote them there ; and David said , God has broken in upon mine enemies by my hand , as the breaking forth of waters . Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim .

DARBY	1%20Chronicles	15	15	And the children of the Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves upon them , as Moses had commanded according to the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	15	2	Then David said , None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites , for them has Jehovah chosen to carry the ark of God , and to serve him for ever .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	15	3	And David assembled all Israel to Jerusalem , to bring up the ark of Jehovah to its place that he had prepared for it .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	15	4	And David gathered the sons of Aaron and the Levites :

DARBY	1%20Chronicles	15	12	and he said to them , Ye are the chief fathers of the Levites ; hallow yourselves , ye and your brethren , that ye may bring up the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel to [ the place that ] I have prepared for it .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	15	13	For because ye did [ it ] not at the first , Jehovah our God made a breach upon us , for that we sought him not after the due order .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	15	14	So the priests and the Levites hallowed themselves to bring up the ark of Jehovah the God of Israel .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	15	16	And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren , the singers , with instruments of music , lutes , and harps , and cymbals , that they should sound aloud , lifting up the voice with joy .

DARBY	1%20Chronicles	15	25	And David , and the elders of Israel , and the captains over thousands , went to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	15	26	And it came to pass , when God helped the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of Jehovah , that they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	15	27	And David was clothed with a robe of byssus , and all the Levites that bore the ark , and the singers , and Chenaniah chief of the music of the singers ; and David had upon him a linen ephod .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	15	28	And all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah with shouting , and with sound of the trumpet , and with clarions , and with cymbals , playing aloud with lutes and harps .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	15	29	And it came to pass as the ark of the covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looked through a window , and saw king David dancing and playing ; and she despised him in her heart .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	1	Chronicles
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	16	Which he made with Abraham , And of his oath unto Isaac ;
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	2	And when David had ended offering up the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings , he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	3	And he dealt to every one of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a loaf of bread and a measure [ of wine ] and a raisin-cake .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	4	And he appointed certain of the Levites to do the service before the ark of Jehovah , and to celebrate , and to thank and praise Jehovah the God of Israel :
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	5	Asaph the chief , and second to him Zechariah , Jeiel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Mattithiah , and Eliab , and Benaiah and Obed-Edom , and Jeiel , with instruments of lutes and with harps ; and Asaph sounding with cymbals ;
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	6	and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually , before the ark of the covenant of God .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	7	Then on that day David delivered first [ this psalm ] to give thanks to Jehovah through Asaph and his brethren .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	8	Give thanks unto Jehovah , call upon his name ; Make known his acts among the peoples .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	9	Sing unto him , sing psalms unto him ; Meditate upon all his wondrous works .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	10	Glory in his holy name : Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	11	Seek Jehovah and his strength , Seek his face continually ;
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	12	Remember his wondrous works which he hath done ; His miracles , and the judgments of his mouth :
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	13	Ye seed of Israel his servant , Ye sons of Jacob , his chosen ones .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	14	He , Jehovah , is our God ; His judgments are in all the earth .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	15	Be ye ever mindful of his covenant , The word which he commanded to a thousand generations , —
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	17	And he confirmed it unto Jacob for a statute , Unto Israel for an everlasting covenant ,
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	18	Saying , Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan , The lot of your inheritance ;
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	19	When ye were a few men in number , Of small account , and strangers in it .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	20	And they went from nation to nation , And from one kingdom to another people .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	21	He suffered no man to oppress them , And reproved kings for their sakes ,
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	22	[ Saying , ] Touch not mine anointed ones , And do my prophets no harm .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	23	Sing unto Jehovah , all the earth ; Publish his salvation from day to day .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	24	Declare his glory among the nations , His wondrous works among all peoples .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	25	For Jehovah is great , and exceedingly to be praised ; And he is terrible above all gods .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	26	For all the gods of the peoples are idols ; But Jehovah made the heavens .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	27	Majesty and splendour are before him ; Strength and gladness in his place .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	28	Give unto Jehovah , ye families of peoples , Give unto Jehovah glory and strength !
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	29	Give unto Jehovah the glory of his name ! Bring an oblation , and come before him : Worship Jehovah in holy splendour .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	30	Tremble before him , all the earth : The world also is established , it shall not be moved .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	31	Let the heavens rejoice , and let the earth be glad ; And let them say among the nations , Jehovah reigneth !
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	32	Let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof ; Let the field exult , and all that is therein .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	33	Then shall the trees of the forest sing out at the presence of Jehovah , For he cometh to judge the earth .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	34	Give thanks unto Jehovah , for he is good ; For his loving-kindness [ endureth ] for ever .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	35	And say , Save us , O God of our salvation , And gather us , and deliver us from the nations , To give thanks unto thy holy name , To triumph in thy praise .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	36	Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel , from eternity and to eternity ! And all the people said , Amen ! and praised Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	37	And he left there , before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah , Asaph and his brethren , to do the service before the ark continually , as every day 's duty required ;

DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	39	And Zadok the priest , and his brethren the priests , before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was at Gibeon ,
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	40	to offer up burnt-offerings to Jehovah on the altar of burnt-offering continually , morning and evening , and according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah , which he commanded Israel ;
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	41	and with them Heman and Jeduthun , and the rest that were chosen , who were expressed by name , to give thanks to Jehovah , because his loving-kindness [ endureth ] for ever ;
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	42	and with them , [ with ] Heman and Jeduthun , trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud ; and the musical instruments of God . And the sons of Jeduthun were at the gate .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	16	43	And all the people departed every one to his house ; and David returned to bless his household .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	1	Chronicles
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	17	And this hath been a small thing in thy sight , O God ; and thou hast spoken of thy servant 's house for a great while to come , and hast regarded me according to the rank of a man of high degree , Jehovah Elohim .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	2	And Nathan said to David , Do all that is in thy heart ; for God is with thee .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	3	And it came to pass that night that the word of God came to Nathan saying ,
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	4	Go and say to David my servant , Thus saith Jehovah : Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in ;
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	5	for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day ; but I have been from tent to tent , and from [ one ] tabernacle [ to another ] .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	6	In all my going about with all Israel , did I speak a word to any of the judges of Israel , whom I commanded to feed my people , saying , Why build ye me not a house of cedars ?
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	7	And now , thus shalt thou say unto my servant David , Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : I took thee from the pasture-grounds , from following the sheep , to be prince over my people Israel ;
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	8	and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest , and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee , and have made thee a name , like unto the name of the great men that are on the earth .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	9	And I will appoint a place for my people Israel , and will plant them , that they may dwell in a place of their own , and be disturbed no more ; neither shall the sons of wickedness waste them any more , as formerly ,
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	10	and since the days that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel . And I will subdue all thine enemies ; and I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	11	And it shall come to pass , when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go [ to be ] with thy fathers , that I will set up thy seed after thee , which shall be of thy sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	12	It is he who shall build me a house , and I will establish his throne for ever .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	13	I will be his father , and he shall be my son ; and I will not take away my mercy from him , as I took it from him that was before thee ;
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	14	and I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever ; and his throne shall be established for ever .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	15	According to all these words , and according to all this vision , so did Nathan speak to David .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	16	And king David went in and sat before Jehovah , and said , Who am I , Jehovah Elohim , and what is my house , that thou hast brought me hitherto ?
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	18	What can David [ say ] more to thee for the glory of thy servant ? thou indeed knowest thy servant .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	19	Jehovah , for thy servant 's sake , and according to thine own heart , hast thou done all this greatness , to make known all these great things .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	20	Jehovah , there is none like thee , neither is there any God beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	21	And who is like thy people Israel , the one nation in the earth that God went to redeem to be a people to himself , to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness , by driving out nations from before thy people , which thou hast redeemed out of Egypt ?
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	22	And thy people Israel hast thou made thine own people for ever ; and thou , Jehovah , art become their God .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	23	And now , Jehovah , let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever , and do as thou hast said .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	24	Let it even be established , and let thy name be magnified for ever , saying , Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel , is God to Israel ; and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	25	For thou , my God , hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house ; therefore hath thy servant found [ in his heart ] to pray before thee .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	26	And now , Jehovah , thou art that God , and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant ;
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	17	27	and now , let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may be before thee for ever ; for thou , Jehovah , hast blessed [ it ] , and it shall be blessed for ever .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	18	1	Chronicles

DARBY	1%20Chronicles	18	8	And from Tibhath , and from Chun , cities of Hadarezer , David took very much brass , of which Solomon made the brazen sea , and the pillars , and the vessels of brass .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	18	9	And Tou king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the forces of Hadarezer king of Zobah ;
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	18	10	and he sent Hadoram his son to king David to inquire of his welfare , and to congratulate him , because he had fought against Hadarezer and smitten him ; for Hadarezer was continually at war with Tou ; [ he sent ] also all manner of vessels of gold and silver and bronze .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	18	11	Them also king David dedicated to Jehovah , with the silver and the gold that he had brought from all the nations : from the Edomites , and from the Moabites , and from the children of Ammon , and from the Philistines , and from the Amalekites .

DARBY	1%20Chronicles	18	14	And David reigned over all Israel , and executed judgment and justice to all his people .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	18	15	And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host ; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was chronicler ;

DARBY	1%20Chronicles	18	17	and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites ; and the sons of David were the first at the king 's hand .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	1	Chronicles
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	19	And the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were routed before Israel , and they made peace with David , and became his servants . And the Syrians would no more help the children of Ammon .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	2	And David said , I will shew kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash , because his father shewed kindness to me . And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father . And David 's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun , to comfort him .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	3	And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun , Is it , in thine eyes , to honour thy father that David has sent comforters to thee ? Is it not to search and overthrow , and to spy out the land that his servants are come to thee ?
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	4	And Hanun took David 's servants , and had them shaved , and their raiment cut off in the midst , as far as the hip , and sent them away .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	5	And [ certain ] went and told David concerning the men ; and he sent to meet them , for the men were greatly ashamed . And the king said , Abide at Jericho until your beards be grown , and then return .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	6	And the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David ; and Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia , and from the Syrians of Maacah , and from Zobah .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	7	And they hired thirty-two thousand chariots , and the king of Maacah and his people ; and they came and encamped before Medeba . And the children of Ammon gathered together from their cities , and came to battle .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	8	And David heard [ of it ] , and he sent Joab , and all the host , the mighty men .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	9	And the children of Ammon came out , and put the battle in array at the entrance of the city ; and the kings that had come were by themselves on the field .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	10	And Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind ; and he chose out of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians ;
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	11	and the rest of the people he gave into the hand of Abishai his brother , and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	12	And he said , If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me ; and if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee , then I will help thee .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	13	Be strong , and let us shew ourselves valiant for our people , and for the cities of our God ; and Jehovah will do what is good in his sight .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	14	And Joab and the people that were with him drew near in front of the Syrians to the battle ; and they fled before him .

DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	17	And it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel , and passed over the Jordan , and came upon them , and set [ the battle ] in array against them . And David put the battle in array against the Syrians , and they fought with him .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	19	18	And the Syrians fled from before Israel ; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand [ in ] chariots , and forty thousand footmen , and slew Shophach the captain of the host .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	20	1	Chronicles
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	20	20	And it came to pass at the time of the return of the year , at the time when kings go forth , that Joab led forth the power of the army , and laid waste the land of the children of Ammon , and came and besieged Rabbah . But David abode at Jerusalem . And Joab smote Rabbah , and overthrew it .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	20	2	And David took the crown of their king from off his head , and found it to weigh a talent of gold , and there were precious stones in it ; and it was [ set ] upon David 's head : and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	20	3	And he brought out the people that were in it , and cut them with the saw , and with harrows of iron , and with saws . And so David did to all the cities of the children of Ammon . And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem .

DARBY	1%20Chronicles	20	5	And there was again a battle with the Philistines ; and Elhanan the son of Jair smote Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite ; now the shaft of his spear was like a weaver 's beam .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	20	6	And there was again a battle , at Gath ; and there was a man [ there ] of great stature , whose fingers [ and toes ] were four and twenty , six [ on each hand ] , and six [ on each foot ] ; and he also was born to Rapha .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	20	7	And he defied Israel ; but Jonathan the son of Shimea David 's brother smote him .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	20	8	These were born to Rapha in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	1	Chronicles
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	21	And David came to Ornan , and Ornan looked and saw David , and went out of the threshing-floor , and bowed himself to David with [ his ] face to the ground .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	2	And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people , Go , number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan ; and bring the number of them to me , that I may know it .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	3	And Joab said , Jehovah add to his people , how many soever they be , a hundredfold : are they not all , my lord O king , my lord 's servants ? why does my lord require this thing ? why should he become a trespass to Israel ?
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	4	But the king 's word prevailed against Joab ; and Joab departed , and went through all Israel , and came [ again ] to Jerusalem .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	5	And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David . And all they of Israel were eleven hundred thousand men that drew sword ; and of Judah , four hundred and seventy thousand men that drew sword .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	6	But Levi and Benjamin he did not count among them ; for the king 's word was abominable to Joab .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	7	And God was displeased on account of this thing , and he smote Israel .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	8	And David said to God , I have sinned greatly , in that I have done this thing ; and now , I beseech thee , put away the iniquity of thy servant ; for I have done very foolishly .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	9	And Jehovah spoke to Gad , David 's seer , saying ,
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	10	Go and speak to David saying , Thus saith Jehovah : I offer thee three [ things ] ; choose one of them , that I may do it unto thee .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	11	And Gad came to David , and said to him , Thus saith Jehovah :
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	12	Choose thee , either three years of famine , or three months to be destroyed before thine adversaries while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee , or three days the sword of Jehovah and the pestilence in the land , and the angel of Jehovah destroying through all the borders of Israel . And now consider what word I shall bring again to him that sent me .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	13	And David said to Gad , I am in a great strait : let me fall , I pray thee , into the hand of Jehovah , for his mercies are very great ; but let me not fall into the hand of man .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	14	And Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel ; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	15	And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it ; and as he was destroying , Jehovah beheld , and he repented him of the evil , and said to the angel that destroyed , It is enough ; withdraw now thine hand . And the angel of Jehovah stood by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	16	And David lifted up his eyes , and saw the angel of Jehovah stand between the earth and the heavens , and his sword drawn in his hand , stretched out over Jerusalem . And David and the elders , clothed in sackcloth , fell on their faces .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	17	And David said to God , Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered ? It is I that have sinned and done evil ; but these sheep , what have they done ? Let thy hand , I pray thee , Jehovah my God , be on me and on my father 's house ; but not on thy people , that they should be smitten .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	18	And the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David , that David should go up and rear an altar to Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	19	And David went up at the saying of Gad , which he had spoken in the name of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	20	And Ornan turned back and saw the angel ; and his four sons with him hid themselves . Now Ornan was threshing wheat .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	22	And David said to Ornan , Grant me the place of the threshing-floor , that I may build an altar in it to Jehovah : grant it to me for the full money , that the plague may be stayed from the people .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	23	And Ornan said to David , Take it to thee , and let my lord the king do that which is good in his sight : see , I give the oxen for the burnt-offering , and the threshing-sledges for wood , and the wheat for the oblation ; I give it all .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	24	And king David said to Ornan , No ; but I will in any case buy [ them ] for the full money ; for I will not take that which is thine for Jehovah , to offer up a burnt-offering without cost .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	25	And David gave to Ornan for the place in shekels of gold the weight of six hundred [ shekels ] .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	26	And David built there an altar to Jehovah , and offered up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings , and called upon Jehovah ; and he answered him from the heavens by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	27	And Jehovah spoke to the angel ; and he put up his sword again into its sheath .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	28	At that time when David saw that Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite , then he sacrificed there .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	29	And the tabernacle of Jehovah , which Moses had made in the wilderness , and the altar of burnt-offering , were at that time in the high place at Gibeon .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	21	30	But David could not go before it to inquire of God ; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	1	Chronicles
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	22	And David said , This is the house of Jehovah Elohim , and this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	2	And David commanded to collect the strangers that were in the land of Israel ; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	3	And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates , and for the joists , and brass in abundance without weight ;
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	4	and cedar-trees innumerable ; for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar-wood in abundance to David .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	5	For David said , Solomon my son is young and tender , and the house that is to be built for Jehovah must be exceeding great in fame and in beauty in all lands : I will therefore make preparation for it . And David prepared abundantly before his death .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	6	And he called for Solomon his son , and charged him to build a house for Jehovah the God of Israel .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	7	And David said to Solomon , As for me , my son , I was minded to build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	8	But the word of Jehovah came to me saying , Thou hast shed blood abundantly , and hast made great wars : thou shalt not build a house unto my name , for thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	9	Behold , a son shall be born to thee , who shall be a man of rest ; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about ; for his name shall be Solomon , and in his days I will give peace and quietness unto Israel .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	10	He shall build a house unto my name ; and he shall be my son , and I will be his father ; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	11	Now , my son , Jehovah be with thee , that thou mayest prosper , and build the house of Jehovah thy God , as he has said of thee .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	12	Only , Jehovah give thee wisdom and understanding , and place thee over Israel , and to keep the law of Jehovah thy God .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	13	Then shalt thou prosper , if thou takest heed to perform the statutes and ordinances which Jehovah commanded Moses for Israel : be strong and courageous ; fear not , neither be dismayed .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	14	And behold , in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah a hundred thousand talents of gold , and a thousand thousand talents of silver ; and of brass and iron without weight , for it is in abundance ; and timber and stone have I prepared ; and thou shalt add to it .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	15	And there are workmen with thee in abundance , hewers and workers of stone and timber , and all manner of skilful men for every kind of work .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	16	Of the gold , the silver , and the brass , and the iron , there is no number . Arise and be doing and Jehovah be with thee .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	17	And David commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son , [ saying , ]
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	18	Is not Jehovah your God with you ? and has he [ not ] given you rest on every side ? for he has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand ; and the land is subdued before Jehovah , and before his people .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	22	19	Now set your heart and your soul to seek Jehovah your God ; and arise and build the sanctuary of Jehovah Elohim , to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah , and the vessels of the sanctuary of God into the house that is to be built unto the name of Jehovah .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	1	Chronicles
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	23	The sons of Mushi : Mahli , and Eder , and Jeremoth , three .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	2	And he gathered together all the princes of Israel , with the priests and the Levites .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	3	And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward ; and their number , by their polls , man by man , was thirty-eight thousand .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	4	Of these , twenty-four thousand were to preside over the work of the house of Jehovah ; and six thousand were officers and judges ;
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	5	and four thousand were doorkeepers ; and four thousand praised Jehovah with the instruments which I made , [ said David , ] to praise [ therewith ] .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	6	And David divided them into courses according to the sons of Levi : Gershon , Kohath , and Merari .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	7	Of the Gershonites : Laadan and Shimei .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	8	The sons of Laadan : the head was Jehiel , and Zetham , and Joel , three .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	9	The sons of Shimei : Shelomith , and Haziel , and Haran , three . These were the chief fathers of Laadan .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	10	And the sons of Shimei : Jahath , Ziza , and Jeush , and Beriah . These were the four sons of Shimei .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	11	And Jahath was the head , and Ziza the second ; and Jeush and Beriah had not many sons : as father 's house , therefore , they were reckoned as one .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	12	The sons of Kohath : Amram , Jizhar , Hebron , and Uzziel , four .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	13	The sons of Amram : Aaron and Moses . And Aaron was separated , that he should be hallowed as most holy , he and his sons for ever , to offer before Jehovah , to do service to him , and to bless in his name for ever .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	14	—And as to Moses the man of God , his sons were named of the tribe of Levi .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	15	The sons of Moses : Gershom and Eliezer .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	16	The sons of Gershom : Shebuel the head .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	17	And the sons of Eliezer : Rehabiah the head ; and Eliezer had no other sons , but the sons of Rehabiah were very many .

DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	21	The sons of Merari : Mahli and Mushi . The sons of Mahli : Eleazar and Kish .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	22	And Eleazar died , and had no sons , but daughters ; and their brethren the sons of Kish took them .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	24	These were the sons of Levi according to their fathers ' houses , the chief fathers , as they were reckoned , by number of names by their polls , who did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah , from twenty years old and upward .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	25	For David said , Jehovah the God of Israel has given rest to his people , and he will dwell in Jerusalem for ever ;
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	26	and the Levites also have no more to carry the tabernacle , nor any of its vessels for its service .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	27	For by the last words of David was this [ done ] , —the numbering of the sons of Levi from twenty years old and upward .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	28	For their place was by the side of the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah , over the courts , and over the chambers , and over the purifying of all holy things , and [ for ] the work of the service of the house of God ;
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	23	29	and for the loaves to be set in rows , and for the fine flour for the oblation , and for the unleavened cakes , and for [ what is baked in ] the pan , and for that which is saturated [ with oil ] , and for all measure of capacity and size ;

DARBY	1%20Chronicles	29	17	And I know , my God , that thou triest the heart , and hast pleasure in uprightness . In the uprightness of my heart have I willingly offered all these things ; and now have I seen with joy thy people , which are present here , offer willingly to thee .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	29	18	Jehovah , God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Israel , our fathers , keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people , and direct their hearts to thee !
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	29	19	And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep thy commandments , thy testimonies , and thy statutes , and to do all , and to build the palace , for which I have made provision .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	29	20	And David said to all the congregation , Bless now Jehovah your God . And all the congregation blessed Jehovah the God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads , and did homage to Jehovah and the king .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	29	21	And they sacrificed sacrifices to Jehovah , and offered up burnt-offerings to Jehovah , on the morrow after that day : a thousand bullocks , a thousand rams , a thousand lambs , with their drink-offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	29	22	And they ate and drank before Jehovah on that day with great joy . And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time , and anointed him to Jehovah to be prince , and Zadok to be priest .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	29	23	And Solomon sat on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father , and prospered ; and all Israel obeyed him .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	29	24	And all the princes , and the mighty men , and all the sons likewise of king David , submitted themselves to Solomon the king .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	29	25	And Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel , and bestowed upon him royal majesty such as had not been on any king before him in Israel .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	29	26	Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	29	27	And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years : he reigned seven years in Hebron , and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	29	28	And he died in a good old age , full of days , riches , and honour ; and Solomon his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	1%20Chronicles	29	30	with all his reign and his might , and the times that passed over him , and over Israel , and over all the kingdoms of the countries .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	2	And Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to all the princes of all Israel , the chief fathers ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	1	And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom , and Jehovah his God was with him and magnified him exceedingly .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	3	and Solomon , and all the congregation with him , went to the high place at Gibeon ; for there was God 's tent of meeting which Moses the servant of Jehovah had made in the wilderness .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	4	But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim to the [ place ] that David had prepared for it ; for he had spread a tent for it at Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	5	And the brazen altar that Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , had made , was there before the tabernacle of Jehovah ; and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	6	And Solomon offered there upon the brazen altar before Jehovah which was at the tent of meeting ; and he offered up a thousand burnt-offerings upon it .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	7	In that night God appeared to Solomon , and said to him , Ask what I shall give thee .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	8	And Solomon said to God , Thou hast shewn unto David my father great loving-kindness , and hast made me king in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	9	Now , Jehovah Elohim , let thy word unto David my father be firm ; for thou hast made me king over a people numerous as the dust of the earth .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	10	Give me now wisdom and knowledge , that I may go out and come in before this people ; for who can judge this thy great people ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	11	And God said to Solomon , Because this was in thy heart , and thou hast not asked riches , wealth , or honour , nor the life of them that hate thee , neither yet hast asked long life ; but hast asked for thyself wisdom and knowledge , that thou mayest judge my people , over whom I have made thee king :
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	12	wisdom and knowledge are granted unto thee ; and I will give thee riches and wealth and honour , such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee , neither shall any after thee have the like .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	13	Then Solomon came back [ from ] the high place at Gibeon to Jerusalem , from before the tent of meeting , and reigned over Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	14	And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen ; and he had a thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen ; and he placed them in the chariot-cities , and with the king at Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	15	And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem as stones , and cedars made he as the sycamores that are in the lowland for abundance .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	16	And the exportation of horses that Solomon had was from Egypt : a caravan of the king 's merchants fetched a drove [ of horses ] , at a price .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	1	17	And they fetched up and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred [ shekels ] of silver , and a horse for a hundred and fifty ; and so they brought [ them ] by their means , for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	2	And Solomon numbered seventy thousand men to bear burdens , and eighty thousand stone-masons in the mountain , and three thousand six hundred to superintend them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	3	And Solomon sent to Huram king of Tyre , saying , As thou didst deal with David my father , and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell therein [ so do for me ] .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	4	Behold , I build a house unto the name of Jehovah my God to dedicate it to him , to burn before him sweet incense , and for the continual arrangement [ of the shewbread ] , and for the morning and evening burnt-offerings [ and ] on the sabbaths and on the new moons , and on the set feasts of Jehovah our God . This is [ an ordinance ] for ever to Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	5	And the house that I will build is great ; for great is our God above all gods .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	6	But who is able to build him a house , seeing the heavens and the heaven of heavens can not contain him ? And who am I that I should build him a house , except to burn sacrifice before him ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	7	And now send me a man skilful to work in gold , and in silver , and in bronze , and in iron , and in purple and crimson and blue , and experienced in carving , besides the skilful men that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem , whom David my father provided .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	8	Send me also cedar-trees , cypress-trees , and sandal-wood trees , out of Lebanon ; for I know that thy servants are experienced in cutting timber in Lebanon ; and behold , my servants shall be with thy servants ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	9	even to prepare me timber in abundance : for the house that I build shall be great and wonderful .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	10	And behold , I will give to thy servants the hewers that fell timber , twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat , and twenty thousand measures of barley , and twenty thousand baths of wine , and twenty thousand baths of oil .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	11	And Huram king of Tyre answered in writing , which he sent to Solomon , Because Jehovah loved his people , he made thee king over them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	12	And Huram said , Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel , that made the heavens and the earth , who has given to David the king a wise son , endued with prudence and understanding , who will build a house for Jehovah and a house for his kingdom .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	13	And now , I send a skilful man , endued with understanding , Huram Abi ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	14	the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan , and whose father was a man of Tyre , experienced in working in gold , and in silver , in bronze , in iron , in stone , and in timber , in purple , in blue , and in byssus , and in crimson , and for doing any manner of engraving , and for inventing every device which shall be put to him , besides thy skilful men , and the skilful men of my lord David thy father .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	15	And now the wheat and the barley , the oil and the wine , which my lord hath spoken of , let him send unto his servants .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	16	And we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as thou shalt need ; and we will bring it to thee [ in ] floats by sea to Joppa , and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	17	And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel , after the account that David his father had taken of them , and there were found a hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	2	18	And he set seventy thousand of them to be bearers of burdens , and eighty thousand to be stone-masons in the mountains , and three thousand six hundred overseers to set the people to work .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	3	2	And he began to build on the second of the second month , in the fourth year of his reign .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	3	3	And this was Solomon 's foundation for the construction of the house of God . The length by cubits after the first measure was sixty cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	3	4	And the porch which was in front was twenty cubits in length , in front of the house broadways , and the height was a hundred and twenty ; and he overlaid it within with pure gold .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	3	5	And the greater house he boarded with cypress-wood , which he overlaid with fine gold , and set on it palm-trees and chains .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	3	6	And he overlaid the house with precious stones for beauty ; and the gold was gold of Parvaim .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	3	7	And he covered the house , the beams , the threshold , and its walls , and its doors with gold , and engraved cherubim on the walls .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	3	8	And he made the house of the most holy place , the length of which was according to the breadth of the house , twenty cubits , and its breadth twenty cubits ; and he covered it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	3	9	And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold . And he covered the upper chambers with gold .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	3	10	And in the house of the most holy place he made two cherubim of image work , and they overlaid them with gold .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	3	11	And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long : one wing of five cubits touched the wall of the house ; and the other wing of five cubits touched the wing of the other cherub .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	3	12	And the wing of the other cherub of five cubits touched the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cubits joining the wing of the other cherub .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	3	13	The wings of these cherubim spread forth were twenty cubits ; and they stood on their feet , and their faces were toward the house .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	3	14	And he made the veil of blue , and purple , and crimson , and byssus , and made cherubim upon it .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	3	15	And before the house he made two pillars thirty-five cubits long ; and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	3	16	And he made chains [ as ] in the oracle , and he put them on the top of the pillars ; and he made a hundred pomegranates , and put them on the chains .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	3	17	And he set up the pillars in front of the temple , one on the right hand and the other on the left ; and he called the name of that on the right Jachin , and the name of that on the left Boaz .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	2	And he made the sea , molten , ten cubits from brim to brim , round all about ; and its height was five cubits ; and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it round about .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	4	It stood upon twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east ; and the sea was above upon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	3	And under it was the similitude of oxen , encompassing it round about , ten in a cubit enclosing the sea round about , two rows of oxen , cast when it was cast .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	5	And its thickness was a hand-breadth , and its brim like the work of the brim of a cup , with lily-blossoms ; in capacity it held three thousand baths .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	6	And he made ten lavers , and put five on the right and five on the left , to wash in them : they rinsed in them what they prepared for the burnt-offering ; and the sea was for the priests to wash in .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	7	And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance respecting them , and set them in the temple , five on the right hand and five on the left .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	8	And he made ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right hand and five on the left . And he made a hundred golden bowls .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	9	And he made the court of the priests , and the great court , and doors for the court , and overlaid the doors thereof with bronze .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	10	And he set the sea on the right side eastward , over against the south .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	11	And Huram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls . So Huram ended doing the work that he made for king Solomon in the house of God :
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	12	two pillars , and the globes and the capitals on the top of the pillars , two ; and the two networks , to cover the two globes of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	13	and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks , two rows of pomegranates for one network , to cover the two globes of the capitals which were upon the pillars .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	14	And he made the bases , and he made the lavers on the bases ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	15	one sea , and the twelve oxen under it .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	16	And the pots , and the shovels , and the forks , and all their instruments did Huram Abiv make king Solomon for the house of Jehovah , of bright brass .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	17	In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them , in the clay-ground between Succoth and Zeredathah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	18	And Solomon made all these vessels in great number ; for the weight of the brass was not ascertained .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	19	And Solomon made all the vessels that were [ in ] the house of God : the golden altar ; and the tables whereon was the shewbread ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	20	and the candlesticks with their lamps to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle , of pure gold ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	21	and the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs , of gold ( it was perfect gold ) ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	4	22	and the knives , and the bowls , and the cups , and the censers , of pure gold ; and the entrance of the house , the inner folding-doors thereof for the most holy place , and the doors of the house , of the temple , of gold .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	5	2	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel , and all the heads of the tribes , the princes of the fathers of the children of Israel , to Jerusalem , to bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah out of the city of David , which is Zion .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	5	5	And they brought up the ark , and the tent of meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the tent : the priests , the Levites , brought them up .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	5	3	And all the men of Israel assembled themselves to the king at the feast , that of the seventh month .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	5	4	And all the elders of Israel came ; and the Levites took up the ark .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	5	6	And king Solomon , and all the assembly of Israel , that were assembled to him before the ark , sacrificed sheep and oxen which could not be counted nor numbered for multitude .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	5	7	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place , into the oracle of the house , into the most holy place , under the wings of the cherubim ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	5	8	and the cherubim stretched forth [ their ] wings over the place of the ark , and the cherubim covered the ark and its staves above .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	5	9	And the staves were long , so that the ends of the staves were seen outside the ark before the oracle ; but they were not seen without . And there they are to this day .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	5	10	There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put there at Horeb , when Jehovah made [ a covenant ] with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	5	11	And it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place ( for all the priests that were present were hallowed without observing the courses ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	5	12	and the Levites the singers , all they of Asaph , of Heman , of Jeduthun , with their sons and their brethren , clad in byssus , with cymbals and lutes and harps , stood at the east end of the altar , and with them a hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets ) ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	5	13	—it came to pass when the trumpeters and singers were as one , to make one voice to be heard in praising and thanking Jehovah ; and when they lifted up their voice with trumpets , and cymbals , and instruments of music , and praised Jehovah : For he is good , for his loving-kindness [ endureth ] for ever ; that then the house , the house of Jehovah , was filled with a cloud ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	5	14	and the priests could not stand to do their service because of the cloud ; for the glory of Jehovah had filled the house of God .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	2	But I have built a house of habitation for thee , even a settled place for thee to abide in for ever .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	6	but I have chosen Jerusalem , that my name might be there ; and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	3	And the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation of Israel ; and the whole congregation of Israel stood .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	4	And he said : Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel , who spoke with his mouth unto David my father , and hath with his hands fulfilled it , saying ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	5	Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build a house in , that my name might be there ; neither chose I any man to be prince over my people Israel :
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	7	And it was in the heart of David my father to build a house unto the name of Jehovah the God of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	8	But Jehovah said to David my father , Whereas it was in thy heart to build a house unto my name , thou didst well that it was in thy heart ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	9	nevertheless thou shalt not build the house ; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins , he shall build the house unto my name .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	10	And Jehovah has performed his word which he spoke ; and I am risen up in the room of David my father , and sit on the throne of Israel , as Jehovah promised , and I have built the house unto the name of Jehovah the God of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	11	And in it have I put the ark , wherein is the covenant of Jehovah , which he made with the children of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	12	And he stood before the altar of Jehovah in the presence of the whole congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	13	For Solomon had made a platform of bronze , five cubits long , and five cubits broad , and three cubits high , and had set it in the midst of the court ; and upon it he stood , and he kneeled down on his knees before the whole congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward the heavens ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	14	and said , Jehovah , God of Israel ! there is no God like thee , in the heavens or on the earth , who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	15	who hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou didst promise him ; thou spokest with thy mouth , and hast fulfilled [ it ] with thy hand as at this day .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	16	And now , Jehovah , God of Israel , keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him saying , There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel , if only thy sons take heed to their way to walk in my law , as thou hast walked before me .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	17	And now , Jehovah , God of Israel , let thy word be verified which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	18	But will God indeed dwell with man on the earth ? behold , the heavens and the heaven of heavens can not contain thee ; how much less this house which I have built !
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	19	Yet have respect unto the prayer of thy servant , and to his supplication , Jehovah , my God , to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	20	that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night , upon the place in which thou hast said thou wouldest put thy name : to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	21	And hearken unto the supplications of thy servant , and of thy people Israel , which they shall pray toward this place , and hear thou from thy dwelling-place , from the heavens , and when thou hearest , forgive .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	22	If a man have sinned against his neighbour , and an oath be laid upon him to adjure him , and the oath come before thine altar in this house ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	23	then hear thou from the heavens , and do , and judge thy servants , requiting the wicked , to bring his way upon his own head ; and justifying the righteous , giving him according to his righteousness .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	24	And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy , because they have sinned against thee , and shall turn again and confess thy name , and pray , and make supplication before thee in this house ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	25	then hear thou from the heavens , and forgive the sin of thy people Israel , and bring them again unto the land that thou gavest to them and to their fathers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	26	When the heavens are shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against thee ; if they pray toward this place , and confess thy name , and turn from their sin , because thou hast afflicted them ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	27	then hear thou in the heavens , and forgive the sin of thy servants , and of thy people Israel , when thou teachest them the good way wherein they should walk ; and give rain upon thy land , which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	28	If there be famine in the land , if there be pestilence , if there be blight or mildew , locust or caterpillar ; if their enemies besiege them in the land of their gates ; whatever plague or whatever sickness there be :
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	29	what prayer , what supplication soever be made by any man , or by all thy people Israel , when they shall know every man his own plague , and his own grief , and shall spread forth his hands toward this house ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	30	then hear thou from the heavens , the settled place of thy dwelling , and forgive , and render unto every man according to all his ways , whose heart thou knowest ( for thou , thou only , knowest the hearts of the children of men ) ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	31	that they may fear thee , to walk in thy ways , all the days that they live upon the land which thou gavest unto our fathers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	32	And as to the stranger also , who is not of thy people Israel , but cometh out of a far country for thy great name 's sake , and thy mighty hand and thy stretched-out arm ; when they shall come and pray toward this house ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	33	then hear thou from the heavens , the settled place of thy dwelling , and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for ; in order that all peoples of the earth may know thy name , and may fear thee as do thy people Israel , and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	34	If thy people go out to battle against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them , and they pray unto thee toward this city that thou hast chosen , and the house that I have built unto thy name ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	35	then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication , and maintain their right .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	36	If they have sinned against thee ( for there is no man that sinneth not ) , and thou be angry with them , and give them up to the enemy , and they have carried them away captives unto a land far off or near ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	37	and if they shall take it to heart in the land whither they were carried captive , and repent , and make supplication unto thee in the land of their captivity , saying , We have sinned , we have done iniquity and have dealt perversely ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	38	and if they return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity , whither they have carried them captives , and pray toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers , and the city that thou hast chosen , and the house that I have built unto thy name ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	39	then hear thou from the heavens , from the settled place of thy dwelling , their prayer and their supplications , and maintain their right , and forgive thy people their sin against thee .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	40	Now , my God , I beseech thee , let thine eyes be open and let thine ears be attentive unto the prayer [ that is made ] in this place .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	41	And now , arise , Jehovah Elohim , into thy resting-place , thou and the ark of thy strength : let thy priests , Jehovah Elohim , be clothed with salvation , and let thy saints rejoice in [ thy ] goodness .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	6	42	Jehovah Elohim , turn not away the face of thine anointed : remember mercies to David thy servant .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	2	And the priests could not enter into the house of Jehovah , because the glory of Jehovah filled Jehovah 's house .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	7	And Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of Jehovah ; for there he offered the burnt-offerings , and the fat of the peace-offerings , because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt-offerings and the oblations and the fat .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	3	And all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down , and the glory of Jehovah upon the house , and bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement , and worshipped and thanked Jehovah : For he is good , for his loving-kindness [ endureth ] for ever .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	4	And the king and all the people offered sacrifices before Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	5	And king Solomon sacrificed a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand oxen , and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep . So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	6	And the priests stood in their charges , and the Levites with Jehovah 's instruments of music , which David the king had made to praise Jehovah , for his loving-kindness [ endureth ] for ever , when David praised by their means ; and the priests sounded the trumpets opposite to them , and all Israel stood .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	8	And at that time Solomon held the feast seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great congregation , from the entrance of Hamath unto the torrent of Egypt .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	9	And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly ; for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days , and the feast seven days .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	10	And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents , joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Jehovah had done to David and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	11	And Solomon completed the house of Jehovah , and the king 's house ; and all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of Jehovah , and in his own house , he did prosperously .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	12	Then Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night , and said to him : I have heard thy prayer , and I have chosen for myself this place for a house of sacrifice .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	13	If I shut up the heavens that there be no rain , or if I command the locust to devour the land , or if I send pestilence among my people ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	14	and my people , who are called by my name , humble themselves , and pray , and seek my face , and turn from their wicked ways ; then will I hear from the heavens , and forgive their sin , and heal their land .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	15	Now mine eyes shall be open , and mine ears attentive to the prayer [ made ] in this place ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	16	for I have now chosen and hallowed this house , that my name may be there for ever ; and mine eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	17	And [ as for ] thee , if thou wilt walk before me , as David thy father walked , to do according to all that I have commanded thee , and wilt keep my statutes and mine ordinances ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	18	then will I establish the throne of thy kingdom , according as I have covenanted with David thy father , saying , There shall not fail thee a man to rule over Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	19	But if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I have set before you , and go and serve other gods and worship them ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	20	then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have hallowed to my name , will I cast out of my sight , and will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	21	And this house , which is high , shall be an astonishment to every one that passes by it ; so that he shall say , Why has Jehovah done thus to this land and to this house ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	7	22	And they shall say , Because they forsook Jehovah the God of their fathers , who brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , and have attached themselves to other gods , and have worshipped them and served them ; therefore he has brought upon them all this evil .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	2	that the cities which Huram had given to Solomon , Solomon built them and caused the children of Israel to dwell there .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	8	their children that were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel had not destroyed , upon them did Solomon impose tribute-service until this day .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	3	And Solomon went to Hamath-Zobah , and overcame it .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	4	And he built Tadmor , in the wilderness , and all the store-cities , which he built in Hamath .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	5	And he built upper Beth-Horon and lower Beth-Horon , fortified cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	6	and Baalath , and all the store-cities that Solomon had , and all the cities for chariots , and the cities for the horsemen , and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem , and on Lebanon , and in all the land of his dominion .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	7	All the people that were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , who were not of Israel ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	9	But of the children of Israel , of them did Solomon make no bondmen for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his captains , and captains of his chariots and his horsemen .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	10	And these were the chief of king Solomon 's superintendents , two hundred and fifty , that ruled over the people .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	11	And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David to the house which he had built for her ; for he said , My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel , because the [ places ] are holy to which the ark of Jehovah has come .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	12	Then Solomon offered up burnt-offerings to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah , which he had built before the porch ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	13	even as the duty of every day required , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the sabbaths , and on the new moons , and at the set feasts , three times in the year , —at the feast of unleavened bread , and at the feast of weeks , and at the feast of tabernacles .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	14	And he appointed , according to the ordinance of David his father , the divisions of the priests for their service , and the Levites for their charges , to praise and serve before the priests , as the duty of every day required ; and the doorkeepers by their divisions at every gate : for such was the commandment of David the man of God ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	15	and they did not depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and the Levites concerning any matter , nor concerning the treasures .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	16	And all the work of Solomon was prepared , to the day of the foundation of the house of Jehovah and to its completion . [ So ] the house of Jehovah was finished .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	17	Then went Solomon to Ezion-geber , and to Eloth , on the seashore in the land of Edom .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	8	18	And Huram sent him by his servants ships , and servants that had knowledge of the sea ; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir , and fetched thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	2	And Solomon explained to her all she spoke of , and there was not a thing hidden from Solomon that he did not explain to her .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	9	And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold , and spices in very great abundance , and precious stones ; neither was there any such spice as that which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	3	And when the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon , and the house that he had built ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	4	and the food of his table , and the deportment of his servants , and the order of service of his attendants and their apparel , and his cupbearers and their apparel , and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Jehovah , there was no more spirit in her .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	5	And she said to the king , It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thine affairs and of thy wisdom ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	6	but I gave no credit to their words , until I came and mine eyes had seen ; and behold , the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me : thou exceedest the report that I heard .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	7	Happy are thy men , and happy are these thy servants , who stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom !
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	8	Blessed be Jehovah thy God , who delighted in thee , to set thee on his throne , to be king to Jehovah thy God ! Because thy God loved Israel , to establish them for ever , therefore did he make thee king over them , to do judgment and justice .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	10	( And the servants also of Huram , and the servants of Solomon , who brought gold from Ophir , brought sandal-wood and precious stones .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	11	And the king made of the sandal-wood stairs for the house of Jehovah , and for the king 's house , and harps and lutes for the singers . And there were none such seen before in the land of Judah . )
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	12	And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire , whatever she asked , besides what she had brought to the king . And she turned and went to her own land , she and her servants .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	13	And the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	14	besides [ what ] dealers and merchants brought , and [ what ] all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought of gold and silver to Solomon .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	15	And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold , —he applied six hundred [ shekels ] of beaten gold to one target ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	16	and three hundred shields of beaten gold , —he applied three hundred [ shekels ] of gold to one shield ; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	17	And the king made a great throne of ivory , and overlaid it with pure gold ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	18	and the throne had six steps , with a footstool of gold fastened to the throne ; and there were arms on each side at the place of the seat , and two lions stood beside the arms ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	19	and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps : there was not the like made in any kingdom .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	20	And all king Solomon 's drinking vessels were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of precious gold : silver was not of the least account in the days of Solomon .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	21	For the king 's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram : once in three years came the ships of Tarshish , bringing gold and silver , ivory , and apes , and peacocks .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	22	And king Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	23	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	24	And they brought every man his present , vessels of silver and vessels of gold , and clothing , armour , and spices , horses and mules , a rate year by year .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	25	And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen ; and he placed them in the chariot-cities , and with the king at Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	26	And he ruled over all the kings from the river as far as the land of the Philistines , and up to the border of Egypt .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	27	And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones , and cedars made he as the sycamores that are in the lowland for abundance .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	28	And they brought to Solomon horses out of Egypt , and out of all lands .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	29	And the rest of the acts of Solomon first and last , are they not written in the words of Nathan the prophet , and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite , and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	30	And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	9	31	And Solomon slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David his father ; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	2	And it came to pass when Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard it ( now he was in Egypt , whither he had fled from the presence of king Solomon ) that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	10	And the young men that had grown up with him spoke to him saying , Thus shalt thou say to the people who have spoken to thee saying , Thy father made our yoke heavy , and lighten thou it for us , —thus shalt thou say to them : My little [ finger ] is thicker than my father 's loins ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	3	And they sent and called him ; and Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam saying ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	4	Thy father made our yoke grievous ; and now lighten the grievous servitude of thy father , and his heavy yoke that he put upon us , and we will serve thee .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	5	And he said to them , Come again to me after three days . And the people departed .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	6	And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , How do ye advise to return answer to this people ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	7	And they spoke to him saying , If thou be kind to this people , and please them , and speak good words to them , they will be thy servants for ever .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	8	But he forsook the advice of the old men which they had given him , and consulted with the young men , who had grown up with him , that stood before him .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	9	And he said to them , What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me saying , Lighten the yoke which thy father put upon us ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	11	and whereas my father laid a heavy yoke upon you , * I * will add to your yoke : my father chastised you with whips , but * I * [ will chastise you ] with scorpions .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	12	And Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day , as the king had appointed saying , Come again to me on the third day .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	13	And the king answered them roughly ; and king Rehoboam forsook the advice of the old men ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	14	and spoke to them according to the advice of the young men , saying , My father made your yoke heavy , but * I * will add to it ; my father chastised you with whips , but * I * [ will chastise you ] with scorpions .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	15	So the king hearkened not to the people ; for it was brought about by God , that Jehovah might give effect to his word , which he spoke through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	16	And all Israel saw that the king hearkened not to them ; and the people answered the king saying , What portion have we in David ? and [ we have ] no inheritance in the son of Jesse : every man to your tents , O Israel . Now see to thine own house , David ! And all Israel went to their tents .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	17	But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	18	And king Rehoboam sent Hadoram , who was over the levy ; but the children of Israel stoned him with stones , that he died . And king Rehoboam hastened to mount his chariot , to flee to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	10	19	And Israel rebelled against the house of David , unto this day .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	2	But the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah the man of God , saying ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	11	And he fortified the strongholds , and put captains in them , and stores of victuals , and of oil and wine ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	3	Speak unto Rehoboam , the son of Solomon , king of Judah , and unto all Israel in Judah and Benjamin , saying ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	4	Thus saith Jehovah : Go not up , nor fight with your brethren ; return every man to his house ; for this thing is from me . And they hearkened to the words of Jehovah , and returned from going against Jeroboam .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	5	And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem , and built cities for defence in Judah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	6	And he built Bethlehem , and Etam , and Tekoa ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	7	and Beth-zur , and Soco , and Adullam ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	8	and Gath , and Mareshah , and Ziph ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	9	and Adoraim , and Lachish , and Azekah ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	10	and Zorah , and Ajalon , and Hebron , which are in Judah and in Benjamin , fortified cities .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	12	and in every several city , targets and spears , and made them exceedingly strong . And Judah and Benjamin were his .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	13	And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their districts ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	14	for the Levites left their suburbs and their possessions , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from exercising the priesthood to Jehovah ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	15	and he ordained for himself priests for the high places , and for the he-goats and for the calves that he had made .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	16	—And after them , those out of all the tribes of Israel that set their heart to seek Jehovah the God of Israel came to Jerusalem , to sacrifice to Jehovah the God of their fathers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	17	And they strengthened the kingdom of Judah , and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong three years ; for during three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	18	And Rehoboam took Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David as wife , [ and of ] Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	19	And she bore him children : Jeush , and Shemariah , and Zaham .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	20	And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom ; and she bore him Abijah , and Attai , and Ziza , and Shelomith .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	21	And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines ; for he had taken eighteen wives and sixty concubines , and he begot twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	22	And Rehoboam established Abijah the son of Maachah at the head , to be ruler among his brethren ; for [ he thought ] to make him king .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	11	23	And he dealt wisely , and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin , to all the fortified cities ; and he gave them food in abundance . And he desired [ for them ] a multitude of wives .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	12	2	And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam , because they had transgressed against Jehovah , that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	12	12	And when he humbled himself , the anger of Jehovah turned away from him , that he would not destroy him altogether ; and also in Judah there were good things .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	12	3	with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen ; and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt : Libyans , Sukkites , and Ethiopians .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	12	4	And he took the fortified cities that belonged to Judah , and came to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	12	5	And Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and [ to ] the princes of Judah that had gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak , and said to them , Thus saith Jehovah : Ye have forsaken me , and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	12	6	And the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves ; and they said , Jehovah is righteous .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	12	7	And when Jehovah saw that they humbled themselves , the word of Jehovah came to Shemaiah , saying , They have humbled themselves : I will not destroy them , but I will grant them a little deliverance ; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	12	8	Nevertheless they shall be his servants ; that they may know my service , and the service of the kingdoms of the countries .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	12	9	And Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he took away all ; and he took away the shields of gold that Solomon had made .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	12	10	And king Rehoboam made in their stead shields of bronze , and committed them to the hands of the chief of the couriers who kept the entrance of the king 's house .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	12	11	And it was so , that as often as the king entered into the house of Jehovah , the couriers came and fetched them , and brought them again into the chamber of the couriers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	12	13	And king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem , and reigned ; for Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign , and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city that Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel , to put his name there : and his mother 's name was Naamah an Ammonitess .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	12	14	And he did evil , for he applied not his heart to seek Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	12	15	And the acts of Rehoboam , first and last , are they not written in the words of Shemaiah the prophet , and of Iddo the seer , in the genealogical registers ? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	12	16	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David . And Abijah his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Michaiah , the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah . And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	13	But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them ; and they were before Judah , and the ambush behind them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	3	And Abijah began the war with an army of men of war , four hundred thousand chosen men ; and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men , mighty men of valour .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	4	And Abijah stood up on the top of mount Zemaraim , which is in mount Ephraim , and said , Hear me , Jeroboam , and all Israel !
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	5	Ought ye not to know that Jehovah the God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever , to him and to his sons [ by ] a covenant of salt ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	6	But Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , rose up and rebelled against his lord .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	7	And vain men , sons of Belial , gathered to him and strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon , and Rehoboam was young and faint-hearted , and did not shew himself strong against them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	8	And now ye think to shew yourselves strong against the kingdom of Jehovah in the hand of the sons of David ; and ye are a great multitude , and ye have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made you for gods .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	9	Have ye not cast out the priests of Jehovah , the sons of Aaron , and the Levites , and made you priests as the peoples of the lands ? whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams , he becomes a priest of what is not God .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	10	But as for us , Jehovah is our God , and we have not forsaken him ; and the priests that serve Jehovah are the sons of Aaron , and the Levites are at their work :
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	11	and they burn to Jehovah every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense ; the loaves also are set in order upon the pure table ; and the candlestick of gold with its lamps to burn every evening : for * we * keep the charge of Jehovah our God ; but * ye * have forsaken him .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	12	And behold , we have God with us at our head , and his priests , and the loud-sounding trumpets to sound an alarm against you . Children of Israel , do not fight with Jehovah the God of your fathers ; for ye shall not prosper .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	14	And Judah looked back , and behold , they had the battle in front and behind ; and they cried to Jehovah , and the priests sounded with the trumpets .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	15	And the men of Judah gave a shout ; and as the men of Judah shouted , it came to pass that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	16	And the children of Israel fled before Judah ; and God delivered them into their hand .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	17	And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter ; and there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	18	And the children of Israel were humbled at that time , and the children of Judah were strengthened , because they relied upon Jehovah the God of their fathers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	19	And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam , and took cities from him : Bethel with its dependent villages , and Jeshanah with its dependent villages , and Ephron with its dependent villages .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	20	And Jeroboam did not recover strength again in the days of Abijah ; and Jehovah smote him , and he died .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	21	But Abijah strengthened himself , and took fourteen wives , and begot twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	13	22	And the rest of the acts of Abijah , and his ways and his sayings , are written in the treatise of the prophet Iddo .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	14	2	And Asa did what was good and right in the sight of Jehovah his God ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	14	14	And they smote all the cities round about Gerar , for the terror of Jehovah came upon them ; and they spoiled all the cities , for there was very much spoil in them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	14	3	and he took away the altars of the strange [ gods ] and the high places , and broke the columns , and cut down the Asherahs ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	14	4	and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers , and to practise the law and the commandment .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	14	5	And he removed out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images ; and the kingdom was quiet before him .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	14	6	And he built fortified cities in Judah , for the land had rest , and he had no war in those years ; because Jehovah had given him rest .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	14	7	And he said to Judah , Let us build these cities , and surround them with walls and towers , gates and bars , while the land is yet before us ; for we have sought Jehovah our God ; we have sought him , and he has given us rest on every side . And they built and prospered .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	14	8	And Asa had an army that bore targets and spears : out of Judah three hundred thousand ; and out of Benjamin , that bore shields and drew the bow , two hundred and eighty thousand : all these , mighty men of valour .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	14	9	And Zerah the Ethiopian came out against him with a host of a thousand thousand , and three hundred chariots , and he came to Mareshah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	14	10	And Asa went out against him , and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah near Mareshah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	14	11	And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God , and said , Jehovah , it maketh no difference to thee to help , whether there be much or no power : help us , O Jehovah our God , for we rely on thee , and in thy name have we come against this multitude . Jehovah , thou art our God ; let not man prevail against thee .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	14	12	And Jehovah smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah ; and the Ethiopians fled .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	14	13	And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them to Gerar ; and the Ethiopians were overthrown , that none of them was left alive ; for they were crushed before Jehovah and before his army . And they carried away very much spoil .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	14	15	They smote also the tents of cattle , and carried away sheep and camels in abundance , and returned to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	2	And he went out to meet Asa , and said to him , Hear ye me , Asa , and all Judah and Benjamin : Jehovah is with you while ye are with him ; and if ye seek him he will be found of you , but if ye forsake him he will forsake you .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	15	And all Judah rejoiced at the oath ; for they took the oath with all their heart , and sought him with their whole desire ; and he was found of them . And Jehovah gave them rest round about .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	3	Now for a long while Israel [ was ] without the true God , and without a teaching priest , and without law ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	4	but in their trouble they turned to Jehovah the God of Israel , and sought him , and he was found of them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	5	And in those times there [ was ] no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in , but great disturbances were amongst all the inhabitants of the countries .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	6	And nation was broken against nation , and city against city ; for God disturbed them with all manner of distress .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	7	But as for you , be firm and let not your hands be weak ; for there is a reward for your deeds .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	8	And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet , he took courage , and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin , and out of the cities that he had taken from mount Ephraim , and renewed the altar of Jehovah , that was before the porch of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	9	And he assembled all Judah and Benjamin , and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh , and out of Simeon ; for they fell away to him out of Israel in abundance , when they saw that Jehovah his God was with him .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	10	And they assembled themselves at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	11	And they sacrificed to Jehovah in that day , of the spoil that they had brought , seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	12	And they entered into a covenant to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers , with all their heart , and with all their soul ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	13	and that whoever would not seek Jehovah the God of Israel should be put to death , whether small or great , whether man or woman .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	14	And they swore to Jehovah with a loud voice , and with shouting , and with trumpets , and with cornets .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	16	And also Maachah , the mother of Asa the king , he removed from being queen , because she had made an idol for the Asherah ; and Asa cut down her idol , and stamped it , and burned it in the valley Kidron .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	17	But the high places were not removed from Israel ; only , Asa 's heart was perfect all his days .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	18	And he brought into the house of God the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which he himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	15	19	And there was no war until the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Asa .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	16	2	And Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Jehovah and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria , who dwelt at Damascus , saying ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	16	16	In the thirty-sixth year of the reign of Asa , Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah , and built Ramah , in order to let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	16	3	There is a league between me and thee , and between my father and thy father : behold , I send thee silver and gold ; go , break thy league with Baasha king of Israel , that he may depart from me .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	16	4	And Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa , and sent the captains of his forces against the cities of Israel ; and they smote Ijon and Dan and Abelmaim , and all the store-magazines of the cities of Naphtali .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	16	5	And it came to pass when Baasha heard of it , that he left off building Ramah , and let his work cease .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	16	6	And king Asa took all Judah ; and they carried away the stones and the timber from Ramah , with which Baasha had been building , and he built with them Geba and Mizpah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	16	7	And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah , and said unto him , Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria , and hast not relied on Jehovah thy God , therefore has the army of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	16	8	Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge army , with very many chariots and horsemen ? but when thou didst rely on Jehovah , he delivered them into thy hand .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	16	9	For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro through the whole earth , to shew himself strong in the behalf of those whose heart is perfect toward him . Herein thou hast done foolishly ; for from henceforth thou shalt have wars .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	16	10	And Asa was wroth with the seer , and put him in the prison ; for he was enraged with him because of this . And Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	16	11	And behold the acts of Asa , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	16	12	And Asa in the thirty-ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet , until his disease was extremely great ; yet in his disease he did not seek Jehovah , but the physicians .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	16	13	And Asa slept with his fathers , and died in the one-and-fortieth year of his reign .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	16	14	And they buried him in his own sepulchre , which he had excavated for himself in the city of David , and laid him in a bed filled with spices , a mixture of divers kinds prepared by the perfumer 's art ; and they made a very great burning for him .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	2	And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah , and set garrisons in the land of Judah , and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had taken .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	17	And of Benjamin : Eliada , a mighty man of valour , and with him two hundred thousand , armed with bow and shield ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	3	And Jehovah was with Jehoshaphat , for he walked in the first ways of his father David , and sought not unto the Baals ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	4	but he sought the God of his father , and walked in his commandments , and not after the doings of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	5	And Jehovah established the kingdom in his hand ; and all Judah gave gifts to Jehoshaphat ; and he had riches and honour in abundance .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	6	And he took courage in the ways of Jehovah ; moreover , he removed the high places and Asherahs out of Judah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	7	And in the third year of his reign he sent his princes , Ben-hail , and Obadiah , and Zechariah , and Nethaneel , and Micah , to teach in the cities of Judah ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	8	and with them the Levites : Shemaiah , and Nethaniah , and Zebadiah , and Asahel , and Shemiramoth , and Jonathan , and Adonijah , and Tobijah , and Tob-Adonijah , Levites ; and with them Elishama and Jehoram , the priests .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	9	And they taught in Judah , and had the book of the law of Jehovah with them ; and they went about through all the cities of Judah , and taught among the people .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	10	And the terror of Jehovah was upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about Judah , and they made no war against Jehoshaphat .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	11	And some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and tribute-silver . The Arabians also brought him flocks , seven thousand seven hundred rams , and seven thousand seven hundred he-goats .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	12	And Jehoshaphat waxed exceeding great ; and he built in Judah castles and store-cities .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	13	And he had much business in the cities of Judah ; and men of war , strong and valiant , in Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	14	And these are the numbers of them according to their fathers ' houses . Of Judah the captains of thousands : Adnah the captain , and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valour ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	15	and next to him was Johanan the captain , and with him two hundred and eighty thousand ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	16	and next to him , Amasiah the son of Zichri , who willingly offered himself to Jehovah ; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	18	and next to him was Jehozabad , and with him a hundred and eighty thousand ready prepared for war .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	17	19	These were they that waited on the king , besides those that the king had put in the fortified cities throughout Judah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	2	And after [ certain ] years he went down to Ahab , to Samaria . And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance , and for the people that were with him , and urged him to go up against Ramoth-Gilead .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	18	And he said , Hear ye therefore the word of Jehovah : I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne , and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	3	And Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah , Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-Gilead ? And he said to him , I am as thou , and my people as thy people ; and [ I will be ] with thee in the war .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	4	And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel , Inquire , I pray thee , this day of the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	5	And the king of Israel assembled the prophets , four hundred men , and said to them , Shall we go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle , or shall I forbear ? And they said , Go up , and God will give it into the king 's hand .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	6	But Jehoshaphat said , Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides , that we might inquire of him ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	7	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah ; but I hate him , for he prophesies no good concerning me , but always evil : [ it is ] Micah the son of Imlah . And Jehoshaphat said , Let not the king say so .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	8	Then the king of Israel called a chamberlain , and said , Fetch quickly Micah the son of Imlah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	9	And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah , having put on their robes , sat each on his throne ; and they sat in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	10	And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron , and he said , Thus saith Jehovah : With these shalt thou push the Syrians , until thou have exterminated them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	11	And all the prophets prophesied so , saying , Go up to Ramoth-Gilead , and prosper ; for Jehovah will give it into the king 's hand .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	12	And the messenger that went to call Micah spoke to him saying , Behold , the words of the prophets [ declare ] good to the king with one assent : let thy word therefore , I pray thee , be like one of theirs , and declare good .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	13	And Micah said , As Jehovah liveth , even what my God shall say , that will I declare .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	14	And he came to the king . And the king said to him , Micah , shall we go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle , or shall I forbear ? And he said , Go ye up , and prosper ; and they will be given into your hands .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	15	And the king said to him , How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but truth in the name of Jehovah ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	16	And he said , I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains , as sheep that have no shepherd . And Jehovah said , These have no master : let them return every man to his house in peace .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	17	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , Did I not tell thee that he prophesies no good concerning me , but evil ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	19	and Jehovah said , Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead ? And one spoke saying after this manner , and another saying after that manner .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	20	And there came forth a spirit , and stood before Jehovah and said , I will entice him . And Jehovah said unto him , Wherewith ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	21	And he said , I will go forth , and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets . And he said , Thou shalt entice [ him ] , and also succeed : go forth , and do so .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	22	And now , behold , Jehovah has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets ; and Jehovah has spoken evil concerning thee .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	23	Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near , and smote Micah upon the cheek , and said , Which way now went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak to thee ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	24	And Micah said , Behold , thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go from chamber to chamber to hide thyself .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	25	And the king of Israel said , Take ye Micah , and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city , and to Joash the king 's son ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	26	and ye shall say , Thus says the king : Put this [ man ] in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I return in peace .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	27	And Micah said , If thou return at all in peace , Jehovah has not spoken by me . And he said , Hearken , O peoples , all of you !
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	28	And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-Gilead .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	29	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , I will disguise myself , and will enter into the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . And the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went into the battle .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	30	And the king of Syria commanded the captains of his chariots saying , Fight neither with small nor great , but with the king of Israel only .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	31	And it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , That is the king of Israel ; and they surrounded him to fight ; and Jehoshaphat cried out , and Jehovah helped him ; and God diverted them from him .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	32	And it came to pass that when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel , they turned back from pursuing him .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	33	And a man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of Israel between the fastenings and the corslet . And he said to the charioteer , Turn thy hand and drive me out of the camp ; for I am wounded .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	18	34	And the battle increased that day ; and the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even ; and about the time of the going down of the sun he died .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	19	2	And Jehu the son of Hanani , the seer , went out to meet him , and said to king Jehoshaphat , Shouldest thou help the ungodly , and love them that hate Jehovah ? Therefore is wrath upon thee from Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	19	19	And Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	19	3	Nevertheless there are good things found in thee ; for thou hast put away the Asherahs out of the land , and hast directed thy heart to seek God .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	19	4	And Jehoshaphat dwelt in Jerusalem ; and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim , and brought them back to Jehovah the God of their fathers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	19	5	And he set judges in the land throughout the fortified cities of Judah , city by city .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	19	6	And he said to the judges , Take heed what ye do ; for ye judge not for man , but for Jehovah , who will be with you in the matter of judgment .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	19	7	And now , let the terror of Jehovah be upon you ; be careful what ye do , for there is no iniquity with Jehovah , nor respect of persons , nor taking of presents .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	19	8	—And moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set some of the Levites and priests , and of the chief fathers of Israel , for the judgment of Jehovah and for causes.—And they returned to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	19	9	And he charged them saying , Thus shall ye do in the fear of Jehovah faithfully and with a perfect heart .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	19	10	And what cause soever comes to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities , between blood and blood , between law and commandment , statutes and ordinances , ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against Jehovah , and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren : this do and ye shall not trespass .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	19	11	And behold , Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Jehovah , and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael , prince of the house of Judah , in all the king 's matters ; and ye have the Levites before you as officers . Be strong and do it , and Jehovah will be with the good .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	2	And they came and told Jehoshaphat saying , A great multitude is come against thee from beyond the sea , from Syria ; and behold , they are in Hazazon-tamar , which is Engedi .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	20	And they rose early in the morning , and went forth towards the wilderness of Tekoa ; and as they went forth , Jehoshaphat stood and said , Hear me , Judah , and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem ! Believe in Jehovah your God , and ye shall be established ; believe his prophets , and ye shall prosper !
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	3	And Jehoshaphat feared , and set himself to seek Jehovah , and proclaimed a fast throughout Judah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	4	And Judah gathered themselves together to ask [ help ] of Jehovah : even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	5	And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem , in the house of Jehovah , before the new court ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	6	and he said , Jehovah , God of our fathers , art not thou God in the heavens , and rulest thou not over all the kingdoms of the nations ? And in thy hand there is power and might , and none can withstand thee .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	7	Hast not thou , our God , dispossessed the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel , and given it for ever to the seed of Abraham , thy friend ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	8	And they have dwelt therein , and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name , saying ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	9	If evil come upon us , sword , judgment , or pestilence , or famine , and we stand before this house and before thee—for thy name is in this house—and cry unto thee in our distress , then thou wilt hear and save .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	10	And now , behold , the children of Ammon and Moab , and those of mount Seir , amongst whom thou wouldest not let Israel go when they came out of the land of Egypt , ( for they turned from them , and destroyed them not , )
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	11	behold , they reward us , in coming to cast us out of thy possession , which thou hast given us to possess .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	12	Our God , wilt thou not judge them ? for we have no might in presence of this great company which cometh against us , neither know we what to do ; but our eyes are upon thee .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	13	And all Judah stood before Jehovah , with their little ones , their wives , and their sons .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	14	And upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah , the son of Benaiah , the son of Jeiel , the son of Mattaniah , a Levite of the sons of Asaph , upon him came the Spirit of Jehovah , in the midst of the congregation ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	15	and he said , Be attentive , all Judah , and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem , and thou king Jehoshaphat ! Thus saith Jehovah unto you : Fear not , nor be dismayed by reason of this great multitude ; for the battle is not yours , but God 's .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	16	To-morrow go down against them : behold , they come up by the ascent of Ziz ; and ye shall find them at the end of the valley , before the wilderness of Jeruel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	17	Ye shall not have to fight on this occasion : set yourselves , stand and see the salvation of Jehovah [ who is ] with you ! Judah and Jerusalem , fear not nor be dismayed ; to-morrow go out against them , and Jehovah will be with you .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	18	And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground ; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah , worshipping Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	19	And the Levites , of the sons of the Kohathites , and of the sons of the Korahites , stood up to praise Jehovah the God of Israel with an exceeding loud voice .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	21	And he consulted with the people , and appointed singers to Jehovah , and those that should praise in holy splendour , as they went forth before the armed men , and say , Give thanks to Jehovah ; for his loving-kindness [ endureth ] for ever !
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	22	And when they began the song of triumph and praise , Jehovah set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon , Moab , and mount Seir , who had come against Judah , and they were smitten .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	23	And the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir , to exterminate and destroy [ them ] ; and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , they helped to destroy one another .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	24	And Judah came on to the mountain-watch in the wilderness , and they looked toward the multitude ; and behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and none had escaped .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	25	And Jehoshaphat and his people came to plunder the spoil of them , and they found among them in abundance , both riches with the dead bodies , and precious things , and they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away ; and they were three days in plundering the spoil , it was so much .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	26	And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah , for there they blessed Jehovah ; therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Berachah , to this day .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	27	And they returned , all the men of Judah and Jerusalem , and Jehoshaphat at their head , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for Jehovah had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	28	And they came to Jerusalem with lutes and harps and trumpets , to the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	29	And the terror of God was on all the kingdoms of the lands , when they had heard that Jehovah fought against the enemies of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	30	And the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet ; and his God gave him rest round about .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	31	And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah : he was thirty-five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Azubah , daughter of Shilhi .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	32	And he walked in the way of Asa his father , and turned not aside from it , doing what was right in the sight of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	33	Only , the high places were not removed ; and as yet the people had not directed their hearts to the God of their fathers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	34	And the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , first and last , behold , they are written in the words of Jehu the son of Hanani , which are inserted in the book of the kings of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	35	And after this Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined himself with Ahaziah king of Israel , who did very wickedly .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	36	And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish ; and they made the ships in Ezion-geber .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	20	37	And Eliezer the son of Dodavah , of Mareshah , prophesied against Jehoshaphat , saying , Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah , Jehovah has broken thy works . And the ships were broken , and could not go to Tarshish .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	2	And he had brethren , the sons of Jehoshaphat : Azariah and Jehiel , and Zechariah , and Azariah , and Michael , and Shephatiah : all these were sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	21	And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David ; and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	3	And their father had given them great gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things , besides fortified cities in Judah ; but the kingdom he gave to Jehoram , for he was the firstborn .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	4	And Jehoram established himself over the kingdom of his father , and strengthened himself ; and he slew all his brethren with the sword , and [ certain ] also of the princes of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	5	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	6	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of Ahab , for the daughter of Ahab was his wife ; and he did evil in the sight of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	7	But Jehovah would not destroy the house of David , because of the covenant that he had made with David , and as he had promised to give to him always a lamp , and to his sons .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	8	In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah , and they set a king over themselves .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	9	And Jehoram went over with his captains , and all the chariots with him ; and he rose up by night , and smote the Edomites who had surrounded him , and the captains of the chariots .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	10	But the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day . Then Libnah revolted at the same time from under his hand , because he had forsaken Jehovah the God of his fathers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	11	Moreover he made high places on the mountains of Judah , and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication , and compelled Judah [ thereto ] .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	12	And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet saying , Thus saith Jehovah , the God of David thy father : Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father , nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	13	but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication , like the fornications of the house of Ahab , and also hast slain thy brethren , thy father 's house who were better than thyself :
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	14	behold , Jehovah will smite with a great stroke thy people , and thy children , and thy wives , and all thy substance ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	15	and thyself with sore sicknesses , with a disease of thy bowels , until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	16	And Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines , and of the Arabians , who [ are ] near the Ethiopians ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	17	and they came up into Judah , and broke into it , and carried away all the substance that was found in the king 's house , and his sons also , and his wives ; so that there was no son left him , except Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	18	And after all this , Jehovah smote him in his bowels with an incurable sickness .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	19	And it came to pass , from day to day , and at the time when the second year was drawing to a close , that his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness , and he died in cruel sufferings . And his people made no burning for him , like the burning of his fathers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	21	20	He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign , and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years , and departed without being regretted . And they buried him in the city of David , but not in the sepulchres of the kings .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	22	2	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Athaliah , daughter of Omri .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	22	22	And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead ; for the band of men that came in the camp with the Arabians had slain all the elder ones . And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	22	3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab ; for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	22	4	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah like the house of Ahab ; for they were his counsellors after the death of his father , to his destruction .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	22	5	He walked also after their counsel , and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab , king of Israel , to the war against Hazael the king of Syria at Ramoth-Gilead ; and the Syrians wounded Joram .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	22	6	And he returned to be healed in Jizreel because of the wounds that were given him at Ramah , when he fought with Hazael king of Syria . And Azariah the son of Jehoram , king of Judah , went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jizreel ; for he was sick .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	22	7	But his coming to Joram was from God the complete ruin of Ahaziah . And when he had come , he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi , whom Jehovah had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	22	8	And it came to pass when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab , that he found the princes of Judah , and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah , that attended upon Ahaziah , and he slew them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	22	9	And he sought Ahaziah ; and they caught him ( for he had hid himself in Samaria ) , and brought him to Jehu , and slew him ; and they buried him , for they said , He is a son of Jehoshaphat , who sought Jehovah with all his heart . And in the house of Ahaziah there was no one who was able to [ hold ] the kingdom .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	22	10	And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she rose up and exterminated all the royal seed of the house of Judah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	22	11	But Jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the king 's sons that were slain , and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber . So Jehoshabeath , the daughter of king Jehoram , the wife of Jehoiada the priest ( for she was the sister of Ahaziah ) , hid him from Athaliah , so that she did not slay him ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	22	12	and he was with them hid in the house of God six years . And Athaliah reigned over the land .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	2	And they went about in Judah and gathered together the Levites out of all the cities of Judah , and the chief fathers of Israel ; and they came to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	23	And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself , and took the captains of the hundreds , Azariah the son of Jeroham , and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan , and Azariah the son of Obed , and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat the son of Zichri , into covenant with him .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	3	And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God . And he said to them , Behold , the king 's son shall reign , as Jehovah has said of the sons of David .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	4	This is the thing which ye shall do : a third part of you that come in on the sabbath , of the priests and of the Levites , shall be keepers of the doors ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	5	and a third part shall be at the king 's house ; and a third part at the gate of the foundation ; and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	6	But let none come into the house of Jehovah except the priests and those of the Levites that do the service ; they shall go in , for they are holy ; but all the people shall keep the watch of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	7	And the Levites shall encompass the king round about , every man with his weapons in his hand ; and he that comes into the house shall be put to death ; and ye shall be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	8	And the Levites and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded ; and they took every man his men , those that were to come in on the sabbath , with them that were to go forth on the sabbath ; for Jehoiada the priest did not liberate the divisions .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	9	And Jehoiada the priest gave to the captains of the hundreds king David 's spears and shields and targets , which were in the house of God .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	10	And he set all the people , every man with his javelin in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , toward the altar and the house , by the king round about .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	11	And they brought forth the king 's son , and put the crown upon him , and [ gave him ] the testimony , and made him king . And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him , and said , Long live the king !
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	12	And Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king , and she came to the people into the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	13	And she looked , and behold , the king stood on his dais at the entrance , and the princes and the trumpets were by the king ; and all the people of the land rejoiced , and blew with trumpets ; and the singers [ were there ] with the instruments of music , and such as taught to sing praise . And Athaliah rent her garments , and said , Conspiracy ! Conspiracy !
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	14	And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of the hundreds that were set over the host , and said to them , Lead her forth without the ranks ; and whosoever follows her , let him be slain with the sword ; for the priest said , Ye shall not put her to death in the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	15	And they made way for her , and she went through the entrance of the horse-gate into the king 's house , and they put her to death there .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	16	And Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and all the people and the king , that they should be the people of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	17	And all the people went into the house of Baal , and broke it down ; and they broke his altars and his images in pieces , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	18	And Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of Jehovah under the hand of the priests , the Levites , whom David had set by classes over the house of Jehovah to offer up Jehovah 's burnt-offerings , as it is written in the law of Moses , —with rejoicing and with singing according to the directions of David .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	19	And he set the doorkeepers at the gates of the house of Jehovah , that no one unclean in anything should enter in .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	20	And he took the captains of the hundreds , and the nobles , and the governors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought down the king from the house of Jehovah ; and they came through the upper gate into the king 's house , and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	23	21	And all the people of the land rejoiced , and the city was quiet ; and they had slain Athaliah with the sword .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	2	And Joash did what was right in the sight of Jehovah all the days of Jehoiada the priest .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	24	Truly with a small company of men came the army of the Syrians , but Jehovah delivered a very great army into their hand , because they had forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers ; and they executed judgment upon Joash .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	3	And Jehoiada took for him two wives ; and he begot sons and daughters .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	4	And it came to pass after this , that Joash was minded to renew the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	5	And he gathered together the priests and the Levites , and said to them , Go out to the cities of Judah and collect of all Israel money for the repair of the house of your God from year to year , and ye shall hasten the matter . But the Levites hastened it not .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	6	And the king called for Jehoiada the chief , and said to him , Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the tribute of Moses the servant of Jehovah [ laid upon ] the congregation of Israel , for the tent of the testimony ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	7	For the wicked Athaliah [ and ] her sons had devastated the house of God ; and also all the hallowed things of the house of Jehovah had they employed for the Baals .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	8	And the king commanded , and they made a chest , and set it at the gate of the house of Jehovah without ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	9	and they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem , to bring to Jehovah the tribute of Moses the servant of God [ laid upon ] Israel in the wilderness .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	10	And all the princes and all the people rejoiced , and brought in and cast into the chest , until they had finished .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	11	And it came to pass at the time the chest was brought for the king 's control by the hand of the Levites , and when they saw that there was much money , the king 's scribe and high priest 's officer came , and they emptied the chest , and took it , and carried it to its place again . Thus they did day by day , and gathered money in abundance .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	12	And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of Jehovah , and they hired masons and carpenters to renew the house of Jehovah , and also such as wrought in iron and bronze , to repair the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	13	So the workmen wrought , and the work was perfected by them , and they set the house of God in its state , and strengthened it .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	14	And when they had finished , they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada ; and they made of it vessels for the house of Jehovah , utensils to minister , and with which to offer up , and cups , and utensils of gold and silver . And they offered up burnt-offerings in the house of Jehovah continually all the days of Jehoiada .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	15	And Jehoiada grew old and was full of days , and he died ; he was a hundred and thirty years old when he died .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	16	And they buried him in the city of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , both toward God and toward his house .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	17	And after the death of Jehoiada the princes of Judah came and made obeisance to the king ; then the king hearkened to them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	18	And they forsook the house of Jehovah the God of their fathers , and served the Asherahs and idols ; and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	19	And he sent prophets among them to bring them again to Jehovah , and they testified against them ; but they would not give ear .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	20	And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest ; and he stood up above the people and said unto them , Thus saith God : Wherefore do ye transgress the commandments of Jehovah ? And ye can not prosper ; for ye have forsaken Jehovah , and he hath forsaken you .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	21	And they conspired against him , and stoned him with stones at the command of the king in the court of the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	22	And king Joash remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him , but slew his son . And when he died , he said , Jehovah see and require [ it ] !
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	23	And it came to pass at the end of the year [ that ] the army of Syria came up against him ; and they entered into Judah and Jerusalem , and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people , and sent all the spoil of them to the king at Damascus .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	25	And when they had departed from him ( for they left him in great diseases ) , his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest , and slew him on his bed , and he died ; and they buried him in the city of David , but they did not bury him in the sepulchres of the kings .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	26	And these are they that conspired against him : Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess , and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	24	27	And as to his sons , and the greatness of the burdens [ laid ] upon him , and the building of the house of God , behold , they are written in the treatise of the book of the kings . And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	2	And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah , yet not with a perfect heart .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	25	And Amaziah the son of Joash , king of Judah , lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz , king of Israel , fifteen years .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	3	And it came to pass when the kingdom was established unto him , that he killed his servants who had smitten the king his father .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	4	But their children he did not put to death , but [ did ] according to that which is written in the law in the book of Moses , wherein Jehovah commanded saying , The fathers shall not die for the children , nor shall the children die for the fathers , but every man shall die for his own sin .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	5	And Amaziah gathered Judah together and arranged them according to the fathers ' houses , according to the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds , throughout Judah and Benjamin ; and he numbered them from twenty years old and upwards , and found them three hundred thousand choice men , able for military service , that could handle spear and target .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	6	He hired also a hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for a hundred talents of silver .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	7	But there came a man of God to him , saying , O king , let not the host of Israel go with thee ; for Jehovah is not with Israel , [ with ] all the children of Ephraim .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	8	But if thou wilt go , do [ it ] ; be strong for the battle : God will make thee fall before the enemy , for there is with God power to help and to cast down .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	9	And Amaziah said to the man of God , But what is to be done for the hundred talents which I have given to the troop of Israel ? And the man of God said , Jehovah is able to give thee much more than this .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	10	Then Amaziah separated them , —the troop that was come to him out of Ephraim , —to go home again . And their anger was greatly kindled against Judah , and they returned home in fierce anger .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	11	But Amaziah strengthened himself , and led forth his people , and went to the valley of salt , and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	12	And the children of Judah took ten thousand captive , alive , and brought them to the top of the cliff , and cast them down from the top of the cliff , so that they all were broken in pieces .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	13	But those of the troop that Amaziah had sent back , that they should not go with him to battle , fell upon the cities of Judah from Samaria as far as Beth-horon , and smote three thousand of them , and took much spoil .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	14	And it came to pass after Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites , that he brought the gods of the children of Seir , and set them up to be his gods , and bowed himself down before them , and burned incense to them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	15	And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Amaziah , and he sent to him a prophet , who said to him , Why dost thou seek after the gods of a people who have not delivered their own people out of thy hand ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	16	And it came to pass as he talked with him , that [ Amaziah ] said to him , Hast thou been made the king 's counsellor ? Forbear ; why shouldest thou be smitten ? Then the prophet forbore , and said , I know that God has determined to destroy thee , because thou hast done this , and hast not hearkened to my counsel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	17	And Amaziah king of Judah took counsel , and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz , the son of Jehu , king of Israel , saying , Come , let us look one another in the face .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	18	And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah , saying , The thorn-bush that is in Lebanon sent to the cedar that is in Lebanon , saying , Give thy daughter to my son as wife ; and there passed by the wild beast that is in Lebanon , and trode down the thorn-bush .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	19	Thou thinkest , Lo , thou hast smitten Edom ; and thy heart has lifted thee up to boast : abide now at home ; why shouldest thou contend with misfortune , that thou shouldest fall , thou and Judah with thee ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	20	But Amaziah would not hear ; for it was of God , that he might deliver them into [ the enemy 's ] hand , because they had sought after the gods of Edom .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	21	And Joash king of Israel went up ; and they looked one another in the face , he and Amaziah king of Judah , at Beth-shemesh , which is in Judah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	22	And Judah was routed before Israel ; and they fled every man to his tent .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	23	And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah , the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz , at Beth-shemesh , and brought him to Jerusalem , and he broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate , four hundred cubits .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	24	And he [ took ] all the gold and the silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom , and the treasures of the king 's house , and hostages , and returned to Samaria .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	26	And the rest of the acts of Amaziah , first and last , behold , are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	27	And from the time that Amaziah turned aside from following Jehovah , they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem ; and he fled to Lachish ; and they sent after him to Lachish , and slew him there .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	25	28	And they brought him on horses , and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	2	It was he that built Eloth , and restored it to Judah , after the king slept with his fathers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	26	And all the people of Judah took Uzziah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king instead of his father Amaziah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	3	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	4	And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah , according to all that his father Amaziah had done .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	5	And he sought God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding in the visions of God ; and in the days that he sought Jehovah , God made him to prosper .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	6	And he went forth and fought against the Philistines , and broke down the wall of Gath , and the wall of Jabneh , and the wall of Ashdod ; and built cities about Ashdod , and among the Philistines .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	7	And God helped him against the Philistines , and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-Baal , and the Maonites .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	8	And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah : and his name spread abroad to the entrance of Egypt ; for he became exceeding strong .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	9	And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the angle , and fortified them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	10	And he built towers in the desert and digged many cisterns ; for he had much cattle , both in the lowland and on the plateau , husbandmen [ also ] and vinedressers on the mountains and in Carmel ; for he loved husbandry .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	11	And Uzziah had an army of fighting men , that went out to war by bands , according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler , under the hand of Hananiah , one of the king 's captains .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	12	The whole number of the chief fathers of the mighty men of valour was two thousand six hundred .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	13	And under their hand was an army-host of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred , that made war with mighty power to help the king against the enemy .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	14	And Uzziah prepared for them , throughout the host , shields , and spears , and helmets , and coats of mail , and bows , and even slinging-stones .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	15	And he made in Jerusalem machines invented by skilful men , to be upon the towers and upon the bulwarks , wherewith to shoot arrows and great stones . And his name spread far abroad ; for he was marvellously helped , till he became strong .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	16	But when he became strong his heart was lifted up to [ his ] downfall ; and he transgressed against Jehovah his God , and went into the temple of Jehovah to burn incense upon the altar of incense .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	17	And Azariah the priest went in after him , and with him priests of Jehovah , eighty valiant men ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	18	and they withstood Uzziah the king , and said to him , It is not for thee , Uzziah , to burn incense to Jehovah , but for the priests the sons of Aaron , that are consecrated to burn incense . Go out of the sanctuary ; for thou hast transgressed ; neither shall it be for thine honour from Jehovah Elohim .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	19	And Uzziah was wroth ; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense ; and while he was wroth with the priests , the leprosy rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of Jehovah , beside the incense altar .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	20	And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him , and behold , he was leprous in his forehead , and they thrust him out from thence ; even he himself hasted to go out , because Jehovah had smitten him .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	21	And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death , and dwelt in a separate house , being a leper ; for he was cut off from the house of Jehovah . And Jotham his son was over the king 's house , judging the people of the land .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	22	And the rest of the acts of Uzziah , first and last , did the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz write .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	26	23	And Uzziah slept with his fathers ; and they buried him with his fathers in the burial-ground of the kings , for they said , He is a leper . And Jotham his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	27	2	And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah , according to all that his father Uzziah had done ; only he entered not into the temple of Jehovah . And the people still acted corruptly .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	27	27	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Jerushah , daughter of Zadok .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	27	3	It was he who built the upper gate of the house of Jehovah , and on the wall of Ophel he built much .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	27	4	And he built cities in the hill-country of Judah , and in the forests he built castles and towers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	27	5	And he fought against the king of the children of Ammon , and overcame them . And the children of Ammon gave him the same year a hundred talents of silver , and ten thousand measures of wheat , and ten thousand of barley . This the children of Ammon brought again to him also in the second year , and in the third .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	27	6	And Jotham became strong , for he prepared his ways before Jehovah his God .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	27	7	And the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all his wars , and his ways , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	27	8	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	27	9	And Jotham slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David ; and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	2	but walked in the ways of the kings of Israel , and even made molten images for the Baals ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	28	Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem . And he did not what was right in the sight of Jehovah , like David his father ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	3	and he burned incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burned his sons in the fire , according to the abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from before the children of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	4	And he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	5	Therefore Jehovah his God gave him into the hand of the king of Syria ; and they smote him , and carried away a great multitude of them captives , and brought them to Damascus . And he was also given into the hand of the king of Israel , who smote him with a great slaughter .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	6	And Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah a hundred and twenty thousand in one day , all valiant men , because they had forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	7	And Zichri , a mighty man of Ephraim , slew Maaseiah the king 's son , and Azrikam the governor of the house , and Elkanah the second to the king .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	8	And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand , women , sons , and daughters , and took away also much spoil from them , and brought the spoil to Samaria .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	9	But a prophet of Jehovah was there , whose name was Oded ; and he went out before the host that came to Samaria , and said unto them , Behold , because Jehovah the God of your fathers was wroth with Judah , he gave them into your hand , and ye have slain them in a rage that reaches up to heaven .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	10	And now ye think to subjugate the children of Judah and Jerusalem as your bondmen and bondwomen . Are there not with you , even with you , trespasses against Jehovah your God ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	11	And now hear me , and send back the captives again , whom ye have taken captive of your brethren ; for the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	12	And certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim , Azariah the son of Johanan , Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth , and Hezekiah the son of Shallum , and Amasa the son of Hadlai , stood up against them that came from the war ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	13	and said to them , Ye shall not bring in the captives hither ; because , for our guilt before Jehovah , ye think to increase our sins and our trespasses : for our trespass is great , and fierce wrath is upon Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	14	Then the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	15	And the men that have been expressed by name rose up , and took the captives , and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them , and arrayed them , and shod them , and gave them to eat and to drink , and anointed them , and carried all the feeble of them on asses , and brought them to Jericho the city of palm-trees , to their brethren . And they returned to Samaria .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	16	At that time king Ahaz sent to the kings of Assyria to help him .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	17	And again the Edomites came and smote Judah , and carried away captives .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	18	And the Philistines invaded the cities of the lowland , and of the south of Judah , and took Beth-shemesh , and Ajalon , and Gederoth , and Socho and its dependent villages , and Timnah and its dependent villages , and Guimzo and its dependent villages ; and they dwelt there .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	19	For Jehovah humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel , for he had made Judah lawless , and transgressed much against Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	20	And Tilgath-Pilneser king of Assyria came to him , and troubled him , and did not support him .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	21	For Ahaz stripped the house of Jehovah , and the house of the king and of the princes , and gave to the king of Assyria ; but he was of no help to him .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	22	And in the time of his trouble he transgressed yet more against Jehovah , this king Ahaz .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	23	And he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus , which had smitten him ; and he said , Since the gods of the kings of Syria help them , I will sacrifice to them , that they may help me . But they were the ruin of him , and of all Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	24	And Ahaz gathered the vessels of the house of God , and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God , and closed the doors of the house of Jehovah , and he made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	25	And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods , and provoked to anger Jehovah the God of his fathers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	26	And the rest of his acts , and all his ways , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	28	27	And Ahaz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , in Jerusalem ; but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel . And Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	2	And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah , according to all that David his father had done .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	29	And when they had ended offering the burnt-offering , the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	3	He , in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of Jehovah , and repaired them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	4	And he brought in the priests and the Levites , and gathered them into the open place eastward ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	5	and he said to them , Hear me , ye Levites : hallow yourselves now , and hallow the house of Jehovah the God of your fathers , and carry forth the filthiness out of the sanctuary .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	6	For our fathers have transgressed , and done evil in the sight of Jehovah our God , and have forsaken him and turned away their faces from the habitation of Jehovah , and have turned their backs .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	7	Also they have shut up the doors of the porch , and put out the lamps , and have not burned incense nor offered up burnt-offerings in the sanctuary to the God of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	8	Therefore the wrath of Jehovah has been upon Judah and Jerusalem , and he has delivered them to vexation , to desolation , and to hissing , as ye see with your eyes .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	9	And behold , our fathers have fallen by the sword , and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	10	Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Jehovah the God of Israel , that his fierce anger may turn away from us .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	11	My sons , be not now negligent ; for Jehovah has chosen you to stand before him , to do service unto him , and to be his ministers and incense-burners .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	12	Then the Levites rose up , Mahath the son of Amasai , and Joel the son of Azariah , of the sons of the Kohathites ; and of the sons of Merari , Kish the son of Abdi , and Azariah the son of Jehalleleel ; and of the Gershonites , Joah the son of Zimmah , and Eden the son of Joah ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	13	and of the sons of Elizaphan , Shimri and Jeiel ; and of the sons of Asaph , Zechariah and Mattaniah ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	14	and of the sons of Heman , Jehiel and Shimei ; and of the sons of Jeduthun , Shemaiah and Uzziel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	15	And they gathered their brethren , and hallowed themselves , and came , according to the commandment of the king by the words of Jehovah , to cleanse the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	16	And the priests went into the inner part of the house of Jehovah to cleanse it , and carried forth all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Jehovah , into the court of the house of Jehovah . And the Levites took it to carry it forth into the brook Kidron .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	17	And they began on the first of the first month to hallow , and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of Jehovah ; and they hallowed the house of Jehovah eight days ; and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	18	And they went in to king Hezekiah , and said , We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah , and the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels , and the table of the [ bread ] to be set in rows , and all its vessels ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	19	and all the vessels that king Ahaz in his reign cast away in his transgression have we prepared and hallowed , and behold , they are before the altar of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	20	And Hezekiah the king arose early , and gathered the princes of the city , and went up to the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	21	And they brought seven bullocks , and seven rams , and seven lambs , and seven he-goats for a sin-offering for the kingdom , and for the sanctuary , and for Judah . And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer [ them ] upon the altar of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	22	And they slaughtered the bullocks , and the priests received the blood , and sprinkled it on the altar ; and they slaughtered the rams , and sprinkled the blood on the altar ; and they slaughtered the lambs , and sprinkled the blood on the altar .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	23	And they brought near the he-goats of the sin-offering before the king and the congregation ; and they laid their hands upon them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	24	And the priests slaughtered them , and they made purification for sin with their blood upon the altar , to make an atonement for all Israel ; because for all Israel , said the king , is the burnt-offering and the sin-offering .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	25	And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals , with lutes , and with harps , according to the commandment of David , and of Gad the king 's seer , and of Nathan the prophet ; for the commandment was of Jehovah through his prophets .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	26	And the Levites stood with the instruments of David , and the priests with the trumpets .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	27	And Hezekiah commanded to offer up the burnt-offering on the altar . And at the moment the burnt-offering began , the song of Jehovah began , and the trumpets , accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	28	And all the congregation worshipped , and the singers sang , and the trumpeters sounded , all [ the time ] until the burnt-offering was finished .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	30	And king Hezekiah and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise to Jehovah with the words of David , and of Asaph the seer . And they sang praises with gladness , and bowed their heads and worshipped .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	31	And Hezekiah answered and said , Now ye have consecrated yourselves to Jehovah , come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of the Lord . And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings ; and as many as were of a willing heart , burnt-offerings .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	32	And the number of the burnt-offerings , which the congregation brought , was seventy bullocks , a hundred rams , two hundred lambs : all these were for a burnt-offering to Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	33	And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	34	Only the priests were too few , and they could not flay all the burnt-offerings ; therefore their brethren the Levites helped them , until the work was ended , and until the priests had hallowed themselves ; for the Levites were more upright in heart to hallow themselves than the priests .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	35	And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance , with the fat of the peace-offerings , and with the drink-offerings for the burnt-offering . And the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	29	36	And Hezekiah rejoiced , and all the people , that God had prepared the people ; for the thing was done suddenly .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	2	And the king took counsel , and his princes , and the whole congregation in Jerusalem , to hold the passover in the second month .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	30	And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah , and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh , that they should come to the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem , to hold the passover to Jehovah the God of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	3	For they could not keep it at that time , because the priests had not hallowed themselves in sufficient number , neither had the people been gathered together to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	4	And the thing pleased the king and the whole congregation .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	5	So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan , that they should come to hold the passover to Jehovah the God of Israel , at Jerusalem ; because they had not held it for a long time as it was written .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	6	And the couriers went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout Israel and Judah , and according to the commandment of the king , saying , Ye children of Israel , return to Jehovah the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , and he will return to the remnant of you that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	7	And be not like your fathers and like your brethren , who transgressed against Jehovah the God of their fathers , so that he gave them up to desolation , as ye see .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	8	Now , harden not your necks , as your fathers ; yield yourselves to Jehovah , and come to his sanctuary , which he has sanctified for ever ; and serve Jehovah your God , that the fierceness of his anger may turn away from you .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	9	For if ye return to Jehovah , your brethren and your children shall find compassion with those that have carried them captive , so that they shall come again unto this land ; for Jehovah your God is gracious and merciful , and will not turn away his face from you , if ye return to him .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	10	And the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh , even to Zebulun ; but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	11	Nevertheless certain of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	12	The hand of God was also upon Judah to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes , by the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	13	And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to hold the feast of unleavened bread in the second month , a very great congregation .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	14	And they rose up and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem ; and they took away all the incense-altars , and cast them into the torrent Kidron .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	15	And they slaughtered the passover on the fourteenth of the second month ; and the priests and the Levites were ashamed , and hallowed themselves ; and they brought the burnt-offerings into the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	16	And they stood in their place after their custom , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprinkled the blood [ receiving it ] from the hand of the Levites .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	17	For there were many in the congregation that were not hallowed ; therefore the Levites had the charge of the slaughtering of the passover-lambs for every one not clean , to hallow them unto Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	18	For a multitude of the people , many of Ephraim and Manasseh , Issachar and Zebulun , had not cleansed themselves , and they ate the passover otherwise than it was written . But Hezekiah prayed for them saying , Jehovah , who is good , forgive every one
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	19	that has directed his heart to seek God , Jehovah the God of his fathers , although not according to the purification of the sanctuary .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	20	And Jehovah hearkened to Hezekiah , and healed the people .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	21	And the children of Israel , that were present at Jerusalem , held the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness ; and the Levites and the priests praised Jehovah day by day , with the instruments of praise to Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	22	And Hezekiah spoke consolingly to all the Levites that had understanding in the good knowledge of Jehovah ; and they ate the feast-offerings the seven days , sacrificing peace-offerings , and extolling Jehovah the God of their fathers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	23	And the whole congregation took counsel to observe other seven days ; and they observed the seven days with gladness .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	24	For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the congregation as heave-offering : a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep ; and a great number of priests hallowed themselves .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	25	And the whole congregation of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that dwelt in Judah , rejoiced .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	26	And there was great joy in Jerusalem ; for since the time of Solomon the son of David , king of Israel , there had not been the like in Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	30	27	And the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people ; and their voice was heard , and their prayer came up to his holy habitation , to the heavens .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	2	And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests , and the Levites after their divisions , every man according to his service , as well the priests as the Levites , for burnt-offerings and for peace-offerings , to serve and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the courts of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	31	And when all this was finished , all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah , and broke the columns , and hewed down the Asherahs , and demolished the high places and the altars in all Judah and Benjamin , in Ephraim also and Manasseh , until they had destroyed them all . And all the children of Israel returned every man to his possession , into their cities .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	3	And [ he ordered ] that the king 's portion [ should be taken ] from his substance for the burnt-offerings : for the morning and evening burnt-offerings , for the burnt-offerings of the sabbaths , and of the new moons , and of the set feasts , as it is written in the law of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	4	And he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites , that they might be encouraged in the law of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	5	And as soon as the commandment was published , the children of Israel gave in abundance the firstfruits of corn , new wine and oil and honey , and of all the increase of the field ; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of all [ things ] .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	6	And the children of Israel and of Judah , that dwelt in the cities of Judah , they also brought the tithe of oxen and sheep , and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated to Jehovah their God , and laid them by heaps .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	7	In the third month they began to lay the heaps , and finished them in the seventh month .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	8	And Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps , and they blessed Jehovah , and his people Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	9	And Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	10	And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok spoke to him and said , Since they began to bring the heave-offerings into the house of Jehovah , we have eaten and been satisfied and have left plenty ; for Jehovah has blessed his people ; and what is left is this great store .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	11	And Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of Jehovah ; and they prepared [ them ] ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	12	and brought in the heave-offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully ; and over these Cononiah the Levite was ruler , and Shimei his brother was second .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	13	And Jehiel , and Azaziah , and Nahath , and Asahel , and Jerimoth , and Jozabad , and Eliel , and Jismachiah , and Mahath , and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother , at the command of Hezekiah the king and Azariah the ruler of the house of God .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	14	And Kore the son of Jimnah the Levite , the doorkeeper toward the east , was over the voluntary-offerings of God , to distribute the heave-offerings of Jehovah , and the most holy things .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	15	And under him were Eden and Miniamin and Jeshua and Shemaiah , Amariah and Shecaniah , in the cities of the priests , in [ their ] set trust , to make distributions to their brethren by [ their ] divisions , to the great as to the small ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	16	besides those from three years old and upward who as males were entered in the genealogical register , —all that came into the house of Jehovah , as the duty of every day required , for their service in their charges , according to their divisions ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	17	—both to the priests enregistered according to their fathers ' houses , and to the Levites from twenty years old and upward , in their charges , by their divisions ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	18	and to all their little ones , their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , the whole congregation of those entered in the register ; for in their trust they hallowed themselves to be holy .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	19	And for the sons of Aaron the priests who were in the country , in the suburbs of their cities , there were , in every several city , men expressed by name , to give portions to all the males among the priests , and to all the Levites that were entered in the register .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	20	And thus did Hezekiah throughout Judah , and wrought what was good and right and true before Jehovah his God .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	31	21	And in every work that he undertook in the service of the house of God , and in the law , and in the commandments , to seek his God , he did it with all his heart and prospered .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	2	And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come , and that he was minded to fight against Jerusalem ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	32	And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his good deeds , behold , they are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	3	he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the fountains of waters that were outside the city ; and they helped him .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	4	And there was gathered together much people , and they stopped all the fountains , and the torrent that flows through the midst of the land , saying , Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	5	And he strengthened himself , and built up all the wall that was broken down , and raised it up to the towers , and [ built ] another wall outside , and fortified the Millo of the city of David , and made darts and shields in abundance .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	6	And he set captains of war over the people , and assembled them to him on the open place at the gate of the city , and spoke consolingly to them saying ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	7	Be strong and courageous , be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria , nor for all the multitude that is with him ; for there are more with us than with him :
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	8	with him is an arm of flesh , but with us is Jehovah our God to help us and to fight our battles . And the people depended upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	9	After this , Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem ( but he himself was before Lachish , and all his power with him ) , unto Hezekiah king of Judah , and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem , saying ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	10	Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria : On what do ye rely that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	11	Does not Hezekiah persuade you , to give yourselves over to die by famine and by thirst , saying , Jehovah our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	12	Has not the same Hezekiah removed his high places and his altars , and commanded Judah and Jerusalem saying , Ye shall worship before * one * altar , and burn incense upon it ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	13	Do ye not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the countries ? Were the gods of the nations of the countries in any wise able to deliver their country out of my hand ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	14	Who is there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers have utterly destroyed , that was able to deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	15	And now , let not Hezekiah deceive you , nor persuade you in this manner , neither yet believe him ; for no +god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand , nor out of the hand of my fathers : how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand ?
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	16	And his servants spoke yet more against Jehovah , the [ true ] God , and against his servant Hezekiah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	17	And he wrote a letter to rail at Jehovah the God of Israel , and to speak against him saying , As the gods of the nations of the countries have not delivered their people out of my hand , so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	18	And they cried with a loud voice in the Jewish [ language ] to the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall , to frighten them and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	19	And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth , the work of man 's hand .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	20	And because of this , king Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz prayed and cried to heaven .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	21	And Jehovah sent an angel , who cut off all the mighty men of valour , and the princes and the captains in the camp of the king of Assyria . And he returned with shame of face to his own land . And when he was come into the house of his god , they that came forth of his own bowels made him fall there with the sword .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	22	And Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria , and from the hand of all , and protected them on every side .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	23	And many brought gifts unto Jehovah to Jerusalem , and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah ; and he was thenceforth magnified in the sight of all the nations .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	24	In those days Hezekiah was sick unto death , and he prayed to Jehovah ; and he spoke to him and gave him a sign .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	25	But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit [ done ] to him , for his heart was lifted up ; and there was wrath upon him , and upon Judah and Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	26	And Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of Jehovah came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	27	And Hezekiah had very much riches and honour ; and he made himself treasuries for silver , and for gold , and for precious stones , and for spices , and for shields , and for all manner of pleasant vessels ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	28	storehouses also for the increase of corn and new wine and oil , and stalls for all manner of beasts , and [ he procured ] flocks for the stalls .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	29	And he provided for himself cities , and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance ; for God gave him very much substance .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	30	And he , Hezekiah , stopped the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon , and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David . And Hezekiah prospered in all his works .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	31	However in [ the matter of ] the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon , who sent to him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all [ that was ] in his heart .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	32	33	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the highest place of the sepulchres of the sons of David ; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death . And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	2	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah , like the abominations of the nations that Jehovah had dispossessed from before the children of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	33	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	3	And he built again the high places that Hezekiah his father had broken down ; and he reared up altars to the Baals , and made Asherahs , and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	4	And he built altars in the house of Jehovah , of which Jehovah had said , In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	5	And he built altars to all the host of heaven in both courts of the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	6	He also caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom ; and he used magic and divination and sorcery , and appointed necromancers and soothsayers : he wrought evil beyond measure in the sight of Jehovah , to provoke him to anger .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	7	And he set the graven image of the idol that he had made , in the house of God , of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son , In this house , and in Jerusalem , which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel , will I put my name for ever ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	8	neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land that I have appointed to your fathers ; if they will only take heed to do all that I commanded them through Moses , according to all the law and the statutes and the ordinances .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	9	And Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray , to do more evil than the nations that Jehovah had destroyed from before the children of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	10	And Jehovah spoke to Manasseh and to his people ; but they did not hearken .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	11	And Jehovah brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria , who took Manasseh with fetters , and bound him with chains of brass , and carried him to Babylon .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	12	And when he was in affliction , he besought Jehovah his God , and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	13	and prayed to him . And he was intreated of him and heard his supplication , and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom . Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah , he was God .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	14	And after this he built the outer wall of the city of David , on the west , toward Gihon , in the valley , even to the entrance of the fish-gate , and carried it round Ophel , and raised it up a very great height ; and he put captains of war in all the fortified cities of Judah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	15	And he removed the strange gods , and the idol out of the house of Jehovah , and all the altars that he had built on the mount of the house of Jehovah and in Jerusalem , and cast [ them ] out of the city .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	16	And he reinstated the altar of Jehovah , and sacrificed on it peace-offerings and thank-offerings , and commanded Judah to serve Jehovah the God of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	17	Nevertheless , the people sacrificed still on the high places , although to Jehovah their God only .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	18	And the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and his prayer to his God , and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel , behold , they [ are written ] in the acts of the kings of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	19	And his prayer , and [ how God ] was intreated of him , and all his sin and his unfaithfulness , and the places in which he built high places , and set up Asherahs and graven images , before he was humbled , behold , they are written among the words of Hozai .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	20	And Manasseh slept with his fathers , and they buried him in his own house ; and Amon his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	21	Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	22	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah , as Manasseh his father had done ; and Amon sacrificed to all the graven images that Manasseh his father had made , and served them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	23	And he did not humble himself before Jehovah , as Manasseh his father had humbled himself ; for he , Amon , multiplied trespass .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	24	And his servants conspired against him , and slew him in his own house .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	33	25	But the people of the land smote all them that had conspired against king Amon ; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	2	And he did what was right in the sight of Jehovah , and walked in the ways of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand nor to the left .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	34	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	3	And in the eighth year of his reign , while he was yet young , he began to seek after the God of David his father ; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places , and the Asherahs , and the graven images , and the molten images .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	4	And they broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence ; and the sun-pillars that were on high above them he cut down ; and the Asherahs and the graven images and the molten images he broke in pieces , and made dust [ of them ] and strewed it upon the graves of those that had sacrificed to them ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	5	and he burned the bones of the priests upon their altars , and purged Judah and Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	6	And [ so did he ] in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon , even to Naphtali , in their ruins round about ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	7	and he broke down the altars , and beat the Asherahs and the graven images into powder , and cut down all the sun-pillars throughout the land of Israel , and returned to Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	8	And in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he purged the land and the house , he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , and Maaseiah the governor of the city , and Joah the son of Joahaz the chronicler , to repair the house of Jehovah his God .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	9	And they came to Hilkijah the high priest , and they delivered [ to them ] the money that had been brought into the house of God , which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim , and of all the remnant of Israel , and of all Judah and Benjamin , and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	10	And they gave [ it ] into the hand of them that did the work , that had the oversight of the house of Jehovah ; and they gave it to the workmen who wrought in the house of Jehovah to reinstate and repair the house :
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	11	they gave [ it ] to the carpenters and the builders , to buy hewn stone , and timber for the joists , and to floor the houses that the kings of Judah had destroyed .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	12	And the men did the work faithfully . And over them were appointed Jahath and Obadiah , Levites , of the children of Merari , and Zechariah and Meshullam , of the children of the Kohathites , for the oversight ; and all these Levites were skilled in instruments of music .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	13	They were also over the bearers of burdens , and were overseers of all that worked in any manner of service . And of the Levites were the scribes , and officers , and doorkeepers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	14	And when they brought out the money that had been brought into the house of Jehovah , Hilkijah the priest found the book of the law of Jehovah by Moses .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	15	Then Hilkijah spoke and said to Shaphan the scribe , I have found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah . And Hilkijah gave the book to Shaphan .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	16	And Shaphan carried the book to the king . And moreover he brought the king word again saying , All that was committed to the hand of thy servants , they do ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	17	and they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Jehovah , and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers , and into the hand of the workmen .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	18	And Shaphan the scribe informed the king saying , Hilkijah the priest has given me a book . And Shaphan read out of it before the king .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	19	And it came to pass when the king heard the words of the law , that he rent his garments .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	20	And the king commanded Hilkijah , and Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Abdon the son of Micah , and Shaphan the scribe , and Asaiah a servant of the king , saying ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	21	Go , inquire of Jehovah for me , and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah , concerning the words of the book which is found ; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is poured out upon us , because our fathers have not kept the word of Jehovah , to do according to all that is written in this book .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	22	And Hilkijah and they that the king [ had appointed ] went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tokehath , son of Hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe : now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter [ of the town ] ; and they spoke with her to that effect .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	23	And she said to them , Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel : Tell the man that sent you to me ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	24	Thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	25	Because they have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my fury shall be poured out upon this place , and shall not be quenched .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	26	But to the king of Judah , who sent you to inquire of Jehovah , thus shall ye say to him : Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel touching the words which thou hast heard :
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	27	Because thy heart was tender , and thou didst humble thyself before God , when thou heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof , and humbledst thyself before me , and didst rend thy garments and weep before me , I also have heard [ thee ] , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	28	Behold , I will gather thee unto thy fathers , and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace ; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil that I will bring upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof . And they brought the king word again .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	29	And the king sent and gathered all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	30	And the king went up into the house of Jehovah , and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and the priests and the Levites , and all the people , great and small ; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	31	And the king stood in his place , and made a covenant before Jehovah , to walk after Jehovah , and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul , to perform the words of the covenant that are written in this book .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	32	And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand [ to it ] . And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God , the God of their fathers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	34	33	And Josiah removed all the abominations out of all the countries that belonged to the children of Israel , and made to serve all that were found in Israel , —to serve Jehovah their God : all his days they did not depart from following Jehovah , the God of their fathers .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	2	And he set the priests in their charges , and encouraged them to the service of the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	35	And Josiah held a passover to Jehovah in Jerusalem ; and they slaughtered the passover on the fourteenth of the first month .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	3	And he said to the Levites , that taught all Israel , [ and ] who were holy to Jehovah , Put the holy ark in the house that Solomon the son of David , king of Israel , built ; ye have not to carry it upon your shoulders . Serve now Jehovah your God , and his people Israel ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	4	and prepare yourselves by your fathers ' houses , in your divisions , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	5	and stand in the sanctuary for the classes of the fathers ' houses , for your brethren , the children of the people , and [ according ] to the divisions of the fathers ' houses of the Levites ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	6	and slaughter the passover , and hallow yourselves , and prepare it for your brethren , that they may do according to the word of Jehovah through Moses .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	7	And Josiah gave for the children of the people a heave-offering of the flocks , lambs and goats , all for the passover-offerings , for all that were present—to the number of thirty thousand , and three thousand bullocks : these were of the king 's substance .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	8	And his princes gave a voluntary heave-offering for the people , for the priests , and for the Levites : Hilkijah and Zechariah and Jehiel , rulers of the house of God , gave to the priests for the passover-offerings two thousand six hundred [ small cattle ] and three hundred oxen ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	9	and Conaniah , and Shemaiah and Nethaneel , his brethren , and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad , chief of the Levites , gave as heave-offering to the Levites for the passover-offerings five thousand [ small cattle ] and five hundred oxen .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	10	And the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Levites in their divisions , according to the king 's commandment .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	11	And they slaughtered the passover , and the priests sprinkled [ the blood ] from their hand , and the Levites flayed them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	12	And they set apart the burnt-offerings to give them to the classes of the fathers ' houses of the children of the people , to present them to Jehovah , as it is written in the book of Moses . And so [ did they ] with the oxen .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	13	And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance ; and the consecrated things they boiled in pots and in cauldrons and in pans , and divided them speedily among all the children of the people .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	14	And afterwards they made ready for themselves and for the priests ; because the priests , the sons of Aaron , [ were engaged ] in offering up the burnt-offerings and the fat until night ; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves , and for the priests , the sons of Aaron .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	15	And the singers , the sons of Asaph , were in their place , according to the commandment of David , and Asaph , and Heman , and Jeduthun the king 's seer ; and the doorkeepers were at every gate ; they had not to depart from their service , for their brethren the Levites prepared for them .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	16	And all the service of Jehovah was prepared the same day , to hold the passover , and to offer burnt-offerings on the altar of Jehovah according to the commandment of king Josiah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	17	And the children of Israel that were present held the passover at that time , and the feast of unleavened bread seven days .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	18	And there was no passover like to that holden in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet ; neither did all the kings of Israel hold such a passover as Josiah held , and the priests , and the Levites , and all Judah and Israel that were present , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	19	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover holden .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	20	After all this , when Josiah had arranged the house , Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Karkemish at the Euphrates ; and Josiah went out against him .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	21	And he sent messengers to him , saying , What have I to do with thee , thou king of Judah ? I come not against thee this day , but against the house with which I have war ; and God has told me to make haste : keep aloof from God who is with me , that he destroy thee not .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	22	But Josiah would not turn his face from him , but disguised himself , that he might fight against him ; and he hearkened not to the words of Necho from the mouth of God ; and he came to fight in the valley of Megiddo .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	23	And the archers shot at king Josiah ; and the king said to his servants , Have me away , for I am sore wounded .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	24	And his servants took him out from the chariot , and put him in the second chariot that he had , and brought him to Jerusalem . And he died , and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers . And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	25	And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah ; and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day ; and they made them an ordinance for Israel . And behold , they are written in the lamentations .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	26	And the rest of the acts of Josiah , and his good deeds , according to that which is written in the law of Jehovah ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	35	27	and his acts , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	2	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem .

DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	4	And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem , and changed his name to Jehoiakim . And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother , and carried him to Egypt .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	5	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem ; and he did evil in the sight of Jehovah his God .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	6	Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and bound him with chains of brass to carry him to Babylon .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	7	And Nebuchadnezzar carried [ part ] of the vessels of the house of Jehovah to Babylon , and put them in his temple at Babylon .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	8	And the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah . And Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	9	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem ; and he did evil in the sight of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	10	And at the turn of the year king Nebuchadnezzar sent and had him brought to Babylon , with the precious vessels of the house of Jehovah ; and he made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	11	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	12	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah his God ; he humbled not himself before the prophet Jeremiah speaking from the mouth of Jehovah .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	13	And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar , who had made him take oath by God ; and he stiffened his neck , and hardened his heart from returning to Jehovah the God of Israel .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	14	All the chiefs of the priests also , and the people , increased their transgressions , according to all the abominations of the nations ; and they defiled the house of Jehovah which he had hallowed in Jerusalem .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	15	And Jehovah the God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers , rising up early and sending ; because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling-place .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	16	But they mocked at the messengers of God , and despised his words , and scoffed at his prophets , until the fury of Jehovah rose against his people , and there was no remedy .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	17	And he brought up [ against ] them the king of the Chaldees , and slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary , and spared not young man nor maiden , old man nor him of hoary head : he gave [ them ] all into his hand .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	18	And all the vessels of the house of God , great and small , and the treasures of the house of Jehovah , and the treasures of the king and of his princes , he brought all to Babylon .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	19	And they burned the house of God , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem , and burned all the palaces thereof with fire , and all the precious vessels thereof were given up to destruction .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	20	And them that had escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon ; and they became servants to him and his sons , until the reign of the kingdom of Persia ;
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	21	to fulfil the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah , until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths . All the days of its desolation it kept sabbath , to fulfil seventy years .
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	22	And in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , that the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished , Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , and he made a proclamation throughout his kingdom , and also in writing , saying ,
DARBY	2%20Chronicles	36	23	Thus says Cyrus king of Persia : All the kingdoms of the earth has Jehovah the God of the heavens given to me , and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem , which is in Judah .

DARBY	Ezra	1	4	And whosoever remains in any place where he sojourns , let the men of his place help him with silver , and with gold , and with goods , and with beasts , besides the voluntary offering for the house of God which is at Jerusalem .
DARBY	Ezra	1	5	And the chief fathers of Judah and Benjamin rose up , and the priests , and the Levites , even all those whose spirit God had stirred , to go up to build the house of Jehovah which is at Jerusalem .
DARBY	Ezra	1	6	And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with articles of silver , with gold , with goods , and with beasts , and with precious things , besides all that was willingly offered .

DARBY	Ezra	3	6	From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer up burnt-offerings to Jehovah . But the foundation of the temple of Jehovah was not [ yet ] laid .
DARBY	Ezra	3	7	And they gave money to the masons and to the carpenters ; and meat and drink and oil to the Zidonians and to the Tyrians , to bring cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa , according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia .
DARBY	Ezra	3	8	And in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem , in the second month , began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites , and all they that had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem ; and they appointed the Levites , from twenty years old and upward , to superintend the work of the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezra	3	9	And Jeshua stood up , his sons and his brethren , Kadmiel and his sons , the sons of Judah , as one [ man ] , to superintend the workmen in the house of God ; [ also ] the sons of Henadad , their sons and their brethren , the Levites .
DARBY	Ezra	3	10	And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah , they set the priests in their apparel , with trumpets , and the Levites the sons of Asaph , with cymbals , to praise Jehovah according to the directions of David king of Israel .
DARBY	Ezra	3	11	And they sang alternately together in praising and giving thanks to Jehovah : For he is good , for his loving-kindness [ endureth ] for ever toward Israel . And all the people shouted with a great shout to the praise of Jehovah , because the foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid .
DARBY	Ezra	3	12	But many of the priests and Levites and chief fathers , the ancient men that had seen the first house , wept with a loud voice , [ when ] the foundation of this house was laid in their sight ; and many shouted aloud for joy .
DARBY	Ezra	3	13	And the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people ; for the people shouted with a great shout , and the noise was heard afar off .
DARBY	Ezra	4	4	And the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah , and troubled them in building ;
DARBY	Ezra	4	2	and they came to Zerubbabel and to the chief fathers , and said to them , We would build with you ; for we seek your God , as ye ; and we have sacrificed to him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria , who brought us up hither .
DARBY	Ezra	4	3	But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the chief fathers of Israel said to them , Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house to our God , but we alone will build to Jehovah the God of Israel , as king Cyrus , the king of Persia , has commanded us .
DARBY	Ezra	4	5	and they hired counsellors against them , to frustrate their purpose , all the days of Cyrus king of Persia , even until the reign of Darius king of Persia .
DARBY	Ezra	4	6	And in the reign of Ahasuerus , in the beginning of his reign , they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem .
DARBY	Ezra	4	7	And in the days of Artaxerxes , Bishlam , Mithredath , Tabeel , and the rest of his companions , wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia ; and the writing of the letter was written in Aramaic , and interpreted in Aramaic .
DARBY	Ezra	4	8	Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king after this sort :
DARBY	Ezra	4	9	Rehum the chancellor , and Shimshai the scribe , and the rest of their companions , the Dinaites , and the Apharsathchites , the Tarpelites , the Apharsites , the Archevites , the Babylonians , the Shushanchites , the Dehaites , the Elamites ,
DARBY	Ezra	4	10	and the rest of the peoples whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over and settled in the cities of Samaria , and the rest [ of the country ] on this side the river , and so forth .
DARBY	Ezra	4	11	This is the copy of the letter that they sent to him : To Artaxerxes the king : Thy servants the men on this side the river , and so forth .
DARBY	Ezra	4	12	Be it known to the king that the Jews who came up from thee unto us have come to Jerusalem ; they are building the rebellious and the bad city , and they complete the walls and join up the foundations .
DARBY	Ezra	4	13	Be it known therefore unto the king , that , if this city be built and the walls be completed , they will not pay tribute , tax , and toll , and in the end it will bring damage to the kings .
DARBY	Ezra	4	14	Now , since we eat the salt of the palace , and it is not right for us to see the king 's injury , therefore have we sent and informed the king ;
DARBY	Ezra	4	15	that search may be made in the book of the annals of thy fathers : so shalt thou find in the book of the annals and know that this city is a rebellious city , which has done damage to kings and provinces , and that they have raised sedition within the same of old time , for which cause this city was destroyed .
DARBY	Ezra	4	16	We inform the king that if this city be built and its walls be completed , by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river .
DARBY	Ezra	4	17	The king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor , and Shimshai the scribe , and the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria , and the other places beyond the river : Peace , and so forth .
DARBY	Ezra	4	18	The letter that ye sent to us has been read before me distinctly .
DARBY	Ezra	4	19	And I gave orders , and search has been made , and it has been found that this city of old time has made insurrection against the kings , and that rebellion and sedition have been raised therein .
DARBY	Ezra	4	20	And there have been mighty kings over Jerusalem , who have ruled over all beyond the river ; and tribute , tax , and toll were paid to them .
DARBY	Ezra	4	21	Now give order to make these men to cease , and that this city be not built , until the order shall be given from me ;
DARBY	Ezra	4	22	and take heed that ye fail not to do this : why should harm grow to the damage of the kings ?
DARBY	Ezra	4	23	As soon as the copy of king Artaxerxes ' letter was read before Rehum , and Shimshai the scribe , and their companions , they went up in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews , and made them cease by force and power .
DARBY	Ezra	4	24	Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem ; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia .
DARBY	Ezra	5	5	But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews , and they did not make them cease till the matter came to Darius ; and then they returned answer by letter concerning it .
DARBY	Ezra	5	2	Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem ; and with them were the prophets of God , who helped them .
DARBY	Ezra	5	3	At that time came to them Tatnai , governor on this side the river , and Shethar-boznai , and their companions , and said thus to them : Who gave you orders to build this house and to complete this wall ?
DARBY	Ezra	5	4	And they said to them after this manner : What are the names of the men that build this building ?
DARBY	Ezra	5	6	The copy of the letter that Tatnai , governor on this side the river , and Shethar-boznai , and his companions the Apharsachites , who were on this side the river , sent to Darius the king .
DARBY	Ezra	5	7	They sent a report to him in which was written thus : To Darius the king , all peace !
DARBY	Ezra	5	8	Be it known to the king that we went into the province of Judah , to the house of the great God , which is being built with great stones , and timber is laid in the walls , and this work is being carried on with diligence , and prospers in their hand .
DARBY	Ezra	5	9	Then asked we those elders : thus we said to them , Who gave you orders to build this house and to complete this wall ?
DARBY	Ezra	5	10	We asked their names also , to inform thee , that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them .
DARBY	Ezra	5	11	And thus they returned us answer , saying , We are the servants of the God of the heavens and the earth , and build the house that was built these many years ago ; and a great king of Israel built and completed it .
DARBY	Ezra	5	12	But after that our fathers had provoked the God of the heavens to wrath , he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , the Chaldean , and he destroyed this house , and carried the people away unto Babylon .
DARBY	Ezra	5	13	But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon , king Cyrus gave orders to build this house of God .
DARBY	Ezra	5	14	And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was at Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon , those did king Cyrus take out of the temple of Babylon , and they were delivered to one Sheshbazzar by name , whom he had appointed governor .
DARBY	Ezra	5	15	And he said to him , Take these vessels , go , carry them into the temple that is at Jerusalem , and let the house of God be built in its place .
DARBY	Ezra	5	16	Then came the same Sheshbazzar , [ and ] laid the foundation of the house of God which is at Jerusalem ; and since that time even until now has it been in building , and it is not completed .
DARBY	Ezra	5	17	And now , if it seem good to the king , let search be made in the king 's treasure-house , which is there at Babylon , whether it be so , that orders were given by king Cyrus to build this house of God at Jerusalem ; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter .
DARBY	Ezra	6	6	Therefore Tatnai , governor beyond the river , Shethar-boznai , and your companions the Apharsachites , who are beyond the river , be ye far from thence :
DARBY	Ezra	6	2	And there was found at Achmetha in the fortress that is in the province of Media a roll , and therein was a record thus written :
DARBY	Ezra	6	3	In the first year of king Cyrus , king Cyrus made a decree [ concerning ] the house of God at Jerusalem : Let the house be built for a place where they offer sacrifices , and let its foundations be solidly laid ; its height sixty cubits , its breadth sixty cubits ,
DARBY	Ezra	6	4	[ with ] three rows of great stones , and a row of new timber ; and let the expenses be given out of the king 's house :
DARBY	Ezra	6	5	and also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that is at Jerusalem and brought to Babylon , be restored and brought again to the temple that is at Jerusalem , in their place ; and thou shalt put [ them ] in the house of God .
DARBY	Ezra	6	7	let the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place .
DARBY	Ezra	6	8	Moreover , I give orders what ye shall do to these elders of the Jews , for the building of this house of God : that of the king 's goods , of the tribute beyond the river , expenses be diligently given to these men , that they be not hindered .
DARBY	Ezra	6	9	And that which they have need of , both young bullocks and rams and lambs , for the burnt-offerings to the God of the heavens , wheat , salt , wine , and oil , according to the appointment of the priests that are at Jerusalem , let it be given them day by day without fail ;
DARBY	Ezra	6	10	that they may present sweet odours to the God of the heavens , and pray for the life of the king and of his sons .
DARBY	Ezra	6	11	Also I have given order that whosoever shall alter this rescript , let timber be pulled down from his house , and being set up , let him be hanged thereon , and let his house be made a dunghill for this .
DARBY	Ezra	6	12	And the God that has caused his name to dwell there overthrow every king and people that shall put forth their hand to alter [ or ] to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem . I Darius have given [ this ] order ; let it be done diligently .
DARBY	Ezra	6	13	Then Tatnai , governor on this side the river , Shethar-boznai , and their companions , because of that which king Darius had sent , did so diligently .
DARBY	Ezra	6	14	And the elders of the Jews built ; and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo . And they built and completed [ it ] according to the commandment of the God of Israel , and according to the commandment of Cyrus , and Darius , and Artaxerxes king of Persia .
DARBY	Ezra	6	15	And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar , which was in the sixth year of the reign of king Darius .
DARBY	Ezra	6	16	And the children of Israel , the priests and the Levites , and the rest of the children of the captivity , kept the dedication of this house of God with joy ;
DARBY	Ezra	6	17	and they presented at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks , two hundred rams , four hundred lambs , and for a sin-offering for all Israel , twelve he-goats , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
DARBY	Ezra	6	18	And they set the priests in their classes , and the Levites in their divisions , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem : as it is written in the book of Moses .
DARBY	Ezra	6	19	And the children of the captivity held the passover upon the fourteenth of the first month .
DARBY	Ezra	6	20	For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves as one [ man ] : they were all pure ; and they killed the passover for all the children of the captivity , and for their brethren the priests , and for themselves .
DARBY	Ezra	6	21	And the children of Israel that were come back out of captivity , and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of the land , to seek Jehovah the God of Israel , did eat ;
DARBY	Ezra	6	22	and they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy ; for Jehovah had made them joyful , and turned the heart of the king of Assyria to them , to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God , the God of Israel .
DARBY	Ezra	7	7	( And there went up [ some ] of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Levites , and the singers , and the doorkeepers , and the Nethinim , to Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king . )
DARBY	Ezra	7	2	the son of Shallum , the son of Zadok , the son of Ahitub ,
DARBY	Ezra	7	3	the son of Amariah , the son of Azariah , the son of Meraioth ,
DARBY	Ezra	7	4	the son of Zerahiah , the son of Uzzi , the son of Bukki ,
DARBY	Ezra	7	5	the son of Abishua , the son of Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the chief priest ,
DARBY	Ezra	7	6	—this Ezra went up from Babylon ; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses , which Jehovah the God of Israel had given . And the king granted him all his request , according to the hand of Jehovah his God upon him .
DARBY	Ezra	7	8	And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month , which was in the seventh year of the king .
DARBY	Ezra	7	9	For upon the first of the first month the project of going up from Babylon was determined on , and on the first of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God upon him .
DARBY	Ezra	7	10	For Ezra had directed his heart to seek the law of Jehovah and to do it , and to teach in Israel the statutes and the ordinances .
DARBY	Ezra	7	11	And this is the copy of the letter that king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest , the scribe , a scribe of the words of the commandments of Jehovah , and of his statutes to Israel :
DARBY	Ezra	7	12	Artaxerxes , king of kings , to Ezra the priest , an accomplished scribe of the law of the God of the heavens , and so forth .
DARBY	Ezra	7	13	I have given orders that all they of the people of Israel , and of their priests and the Levites , in my realm , who are disposed to go to Jerusalem , go with thee .
DARBY	Ezra	7	14	Because thou art sent by the king , and by his seven counsellors , to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem , according to the law of thy God which is in thy hand ;
DARBY	Ezra	7	15	and to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counsellors have freely offered to the God of Israel , whose habitation is at Jerusalem ,
DARBY	Ezra	7	16	and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon , besides the voluntary offering of the people , and of the priests , who offer willingly for the house of their God which is at Jerusalem .
DARBY	Ezra	7	17	Therefore thou shalt buy diligently with this money bullocks , rams , lambs , with their oblations and their drink-offerings , and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is at Jerusalem .
DARBY	Ezra	7	18	And whatever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , that do according to the will of your God .
DARBY	Ezra	7	19	And the vessels that have been given thee for the service of the house of thy God , deliver before the God of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Ezra	7	20	And whatever more shall be needful for the house of thy God which thou shalt have occasion to bestow , bestow it out of the king 's treasure house .
DARBY	Ezra	7	21	And I , I Artaxerxes the king , do give orders to all the treasurers that are beyond the river , that whatever Ezra the priest and scribe of the law of the God of the heavens shall require of you , it be done diligently ,
DARBY	Ezra	7	22	unto a hundred talents of silver , and to a hundred measures of wheat , and to a hundred baths of wine , and to a hundred baths of oil , and salt without prescribing [ how much ] .
DARBY	Ezra	7	23	Whatever is commanded by the God of the heavens , let it be carefully done for the house of the God of the heavens ; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
DARBY	Ezra	7	24	Also we inform you , as regards all the priests and Levites , singers , doorkeepers , Nethinim , and ministers of this house of God , it shall not be lawful to impose tribute , tax , and toll upon them .
DARBY	Ezra	7	25	And thou , Ezra , after the wisdom of thy God , which is in thy hand , set magistrates and judges who may judge all the people that are beyond the river , all such as know the laws of thy God ; and teach ye him that knows [ them ] not .
DARBY	Ezra	7	26	And whosoever will not do the law of thy God and the law of the king , let judgment be executed diligently upon him , whether unto death , or to banishment , or to confiscation of goods , or to imprisonment .
DARBY	Ezra	7	27	Blessed be Jehovah the God of our fathers , who has put [ such a thing ] as this in the king 's heart , to beautify the house of Jehovah which is at Jerusalem ;
DARBY	Ezra	7	28	and has extended mercy to me before the king and his counsellors , and before all the king 's mighty princes . And I was strengthened , as the hand of Jehovah my God was upon me ; and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me .
DARBY	Ezra	8	8	And of the children of Shephatiah , Zebadiah the son of Michael , and with him eighty males .
DARBY	Ezra	8	2	Of the children of Phinehas , Gershom ; of the children of Ithamar , Daniel ; of the children of David , Hattush ;
DARBY	Ezra	8	3	of the children of Shecaniah , of the children of Parosh , Zechariah , and with him were registered by genealogy of the males a hundred and fifty .
DARBY	Ezra	8	4	Of the children of Pahath-Moab , Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah , and with him two hundred males .
DARBY	Ezra	8	5	Of the children of Shechaniah , the son of Jahaziel , and with him three hundred males .
DARBY	Ezra	8	6	And of the children of Adin , Ebed the son of Jonathan , and with him fifty males .
DARBY	Ezra	8	7	And of the children of Elam , Isaiah the son of Athaliah , and with him seventy males .
DARBY	Ezra	8	9	Of the children of Joab , Obadiah the son of Jehiel , and with him two hundred and eighteen males .
DARBY	Ezra	8	10	And of the children of Shelomith , the son of Josiphiah , and with him a hundred and sixty males .
DARBY	Ezra	8	11	And of the children of Bebai , Zechariah the son of Bebai , and with him twenty-eight males .
DARBY	Ezra	8	12	And of the children of Azgad , Johanan the son of Hakkatan , and with him a hundred and ten males .
DARBY	Ezra	8	13	And of the children of Adonikam , the last ones , whose names are these : Eliphelet , Jeiel , and Shemaiah , and with them sixty males .
DARBY	Ezra	8	14	And of the children of Bigvai , Uthai and Zabbud , and with them seventy males .
DARBY	Ezra	8	15	And I gathered them together at the river that runs to Ahava ; and there we encamped three days ; and I surveyed the people and the priests , and found none of the sons of Levi there .
DARBY	Ezra	8	16	And I sent for Eliezer , for Ariel , for Shemaiah , and for Elnathan , and for Jarib , and for Elnathan , and for Nathan , and for Zechariah , and for Meshullam , chief men , and for Joiarib and for Elnathan , men of understanding .
DARBY	Ezra	8	17	And I gave them a commission to Iddo the chief , at the place Casiphia , and I put words in their mouths to say to Iddo [ and ] his brethren the Nethinim , at the place Casiphia , that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God .
DARBY	Ezra	8	18	And by the good hand of our God upon us , they brought us a man of understanding , of the sons of Mahli , the son of Levi , the son of Israel , namely , Sherebiah , with his sons and his brethren , eighteen ;
DARBY	Ezra	8	19	and Hashabiah , and with him Isaiah of the sons of Merari , his brethren and their sons , twenty ;
DARBY	Ezra	8	20	and of the Nethinim , whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites , two hundred and twenty Nethinim : all of them were expressed by name .
DARBY	Ezra	8	21	And I proclaimed a fast there , at the river Ahava , that we might humble ourselves before our God , to seek of him a right way for us , and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
DARBY	Ezra	8	22	For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way ; for we had spoken to the king saying , The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him ; but his power and his anger is against all them that forsake him .
DARBY	Ezra	8	23	And we fasted , and besought our God for this ; and he was entreated of us .
DARBY	Ezra	8	24	And I separated twelve of the chiefs of the priests , Sherebiah , Hashabiah , and ten of their brethren with them ,
DARBY	Ezra	8	25	and I weighed to them the silver and the gold and the vessels , the heave-offering for the house of our God , which the king and his counsellors and his princes , and all Israel present , had offered .
DARBY	Ezra	8	26	And I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver ; and silver vessels a hundred talents , [ and ] of gold a hundred talents ;
DARBY	Ezra	8	27	and twenty basons of gold , of a thousand darics ; and two vessels of shining copper , precious as gold .
DARBY	Ezra	8	28	And I said to them , Ye are holy unto Jehovah ; the vessels also are holy ; and the silver and the gold is a voluntary offering to Jehovah the God of your fathers .
DARBY	Ezra	8	29	Watch and keep [ them ] until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites , and the chiefs of the fathers of Israel , at Jerusalem , in the chambers of the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezra	8	30	And the priests and the Levites received by weight the silver and the gold and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God .
DARBY	Ezra	8	31	And we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth of the first month , to go to Jerusalem ; and the hand of our God was upon us , and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy , and of such as lay in wait by the way .
DARBY	Ezra	8	32	And we came to Jerusalem , and abode there three days .
DARBY	Ezra	8	33	And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Urijah the priest ; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas ; and with them were Jozabad the son of Jeshua , and Noadiah the son of Binnui , Levites :
DARBY	Ezra	8	34	the whole by number and by weight ; and all the weight was written down at that time .
DARBY	Ezra	8	35	The children of those that had been carried away , who had come out of the captivity , presented burnt-offerings to the God of Israel , twelve bullocks for all Israel , ninety-six rams , seventy-seven lambs , twelve he-goats for a sin-offering : all for a burnt-offering to Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezra	8	36	And they delivered the king 's edicts to the king 's satraps , and to the governors on this side the river . And they furthered the people and the house of God .
DARBY	Ezra	9	9	For we are bondmen ; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage , but hath extended mercy unto us before the kings of Persia , to give us a reviving , to set up the house of our God and to repair the ruins thereof , and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem .
DARBY	Ezra	9	2	for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons , and have mingled the holy seed with the peoples of the lands ; and the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this unfaithfulness .
DARBY	Ezra	9	3	And when I heard this thing , I rent my mantle and my garment , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down overwhelmed .
DARBY	Ezra	9	4	Then were assembled to me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel , because of the unfaithfulness of those that had been carried away ; and I sat overwhelmed until the evening oblation .
DARBY	Ezra	9	5	And at the evening oblation I arose up from my humiliation ; and with my mantle and my garment rent , I fell on my knees , and spread out my hands to Jehovah my God ,
DARBY	Ezra	9	6	and said : O my God , I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee , my God ; for our iniquities are increased over [ our ] head , and our trespass is grown up to the heavens .
DARBY	Ezra	9	7	Since the days of our fathers , we have been in great trespass to this day ; and for our iniquities we , our kings , our priests , have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands , to the sword , and to captivity , and to spoil , and to confusion of face , as it is this day .
DARBY	Ezra	9	8	And now for a little space there hath been favour from Jehovah our God , to leave us a remnant to escape , and to give us a nail in his holy place , that our God may lighten our eyes , and give us a little reviving in our bondage .
DARBY	Ezra	9	10	And now , what shall we say , our God , after this ? for we have forsaken thy commandments ,
DARBY	Ezra	9	11	which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets , saying , The land , unto which ye go to possess [ it ] , is an unclean land through the filthiness of the peoples of the lands , through their abominations with which they have filled it from one end to another through their uncleanness .
DARBY	Ezra	9	12	Now therefore give not your daughters to their sons , neither take their daughters to your sons , nor seek their peace or their prosperity for ever ; that ye may be strong , and eat the good of the land , and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever .
DARBY	Ezra	9	13	And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great trespass , seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities [ deserve ] , and hast given us such deliverance as this ,
DARBY	Ezra	9	14	should we again break thy commandments , and join in affinity with the peoples of these abominations ? wouldest thou not be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us , so that there should be no remnant nor any to escape ?
DARBY	Ezra	9	15	Jehovah , God of Israel , thou art righteous ; for we are a remnant that is escaped , as [ it is ] this day . Behold , we are before thee in our trespasses ; for there is no standing before thee because of this .
DARBY	Ezra	10	10	And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them , Ye have acted unfaithfully , and have taken foreign wives , to increase the trespass of Israel .
DARBY	Ezra	10	2	And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel , of the sons of Elam , answered and said to Ezra , We have acted unfaithfully toward our God , and have taken foreign wives of the peoples of the land ; yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing .
DARBY	Ezra	10	3	And now let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives , and such as are born of them , according to the counsel of [ my ] lord , and of those that tremble at the commandments of our God ; and let it be done according to the law .
DARBY	Ezra	10	4	Arise , for this matter is incumbent on thee , and we will be with thee : be of good courage , and do [ it ] .
DARBY	Ezra	10	5	Then Ezra arose , and made the chiefs of the priests , of the Levites , and of all Israel , to swear that they would do according to this word . And they swore .
DARBY	Ezra	10	6	And Ezra arose from before the house of God , and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib ; and when he came thither , he ate no bread and drank no water ; for he mourned because of the unfaithfulness of them that had been carried away .
DARBY	Ezra	10	7	And they made proclamation in Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem ;
DARBY	Ezra	10	8	and that whosoever would not come within three days , according to the counsel of the princes and the elders , all his substance should be confiscated , and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away .
DARBY	Ezra	10	9	Then were all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered together at Jerusalem within three days . It was the ninth month , on the twentieth of the month ; and all the people sat in the open space of the house of God , trembling because of the matter , and because of the pouring rain .
DARBY	Ezra	10	11	And now make confession to Jehovah the God of your fathers , and do his pleasure , and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land , and from the foreign wives .
DARBY	Ezra	10	12	And the whole congregation answered and said with a loud voice , Yes , it is for us to do according to thy words .
DARBY	Ezra	10	13	But the people are many , and it is a time of pouring rain , and it is not possible to stand without : neither is this a work for one day or two ; for we are many that have transgressed in this thing .
DARBY	Ezra	10	14	Let now our princes , while this matter is going on , stand for all the congregation , and let all those that have taken foreign wives in our cities come at the appointed times , and with them the elders of every city , and the judges thereof , until the fierce anger of our God be turned from us .
DARBY	Ezra	10	15	Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this ; and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them .
DARBY	Ezra	10	16	And the children of the captivity did so . And Ezra the priest [ and ] certain of the chief fathers were separated according to their fathers ' houses , and all of them [ expressed ] by name ; and they sat down on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter .
DARBY	Ezra	10	17	And they ended with all the men that had taken foreign wives by the first day of the first month .
DARBY	Ezra	10	18	And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken foreign wives , of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and his brethren : Maaseiah , and Eliezer , and Jarib , and Gedaliah .

DARBY	Ezra	10	44	All these had taken foreign wives ; and there were among them wives who had had children .
DARBY	Nehemiah	1	1	The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah . And it came to pass in the month Chislev , in the twentieth year , as I was in Shushan the fortress ,
DARBY	Nehemiah	1	2	that Hanani , one of my brethren , came , he and [ certain ] men of Judah . And I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped , who were left of the captivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
DARBY	Nehemiah	1	3	And they said to me , Those who remain , that are left of the captivity there in the province , are in great affliction and reproach ; and the wall of Jerusalem is in ruins , and its gates are burned with fire .
DARBY	Nehemiah	1	4	And it came to pass , when I heard these words , that I sat and wept , and mourned for days , and fasted , and prayed before the God of the heavens ,
DARBY	Nehemiah	1	5	and said , I beseech thee , Jehovah , God of the heavens , the great and terrible God , that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and keep his commandments .
DARBY	Nehemiah	1	6	Let thine ear now be attentive , and thine eyes open , to hear the prayer of thy servant , which I pray before thee at this time , day and night , for the children of Israel thy servants , confessing the sins of the children of Israel , which we have sinned against thee : both I and my father 's house have sinned .
DARBY	Nehemiah	1	7	We have acted very perversely against thee , and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the ordinances that thou commandedst thy servant Moses .
DARBY	Nehemiah	1	8	Remember , I beseech thee , the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses , saying , If ye act unfaithfully , I will scatter you among the peoples ;
DARBY	Nehemiah	1	9	but if ye return to me , and keep my commandments and do them , though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heavens , yet will I gather them from thence , and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there .
DARBY	Nehemiah	1	10	And they are thy servants and thy people , whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand .
DARBY	Nehemiah	1	11	O Lord , I beseech thee , let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant , and to the prayer of thy servants who delight to fear thy name ; and prosper , I pray thee , thy servant this day , and grant him mercy in the sight of this man . Now I was the king 's cupbearer .
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	2	And the king said to me , Why is thy face sad , seeing thou art not sick ? this is nothing else but sadness of heart . And I was very sore afraid .
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	3	And I said to the king , Let the king live for ever ! Why should not my countenance be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' sepulchres , lies waste , and its gates are consumed with fire ?
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	4	And the king said to me , For what dost thou make request ? So I prayed to the God of the heavens .
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	5	And I said to the king , If it please the king , and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight , that thou wouldest send me to Judah , to the city of my fathers ' sepulchres , that I may build it .
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	6	And the king said to me—the queen also sitting by him , —For how long shall thy journey be , and when wilt thou return ? And it pleased the king to send me ; and I set him a time .
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	7	And I said to the king , If it please the king , let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river , that they may set me forward till I come into Judah ;
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	8	and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king 's forest , that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which [ appertains ] to the house , and for the wall of the city , and for the house that I shall enter into . And the king granted me , according to the good hand of my God upon me .
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	9	And I came to the governors beyond the river , and gave them the king 's letters . Now the king had sent captains of a force and horsemen with me .
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	10	And when Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobijah the servant , the Ammonite , heard [ of it ] , it grieved them exceedingly that there had come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	11	And I came to Jerusalem , and was there three days .
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	12	And I arose in the night , I and some few men with me—but I told no man what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem—and there was no beast with me , except the beast that I rode upon .
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	13	And I went out by night by the valley-gate , even toward the jackal-fountain , and to the dung-gate ; and I viewed the walls of Jerusalem , which were in ruins , and its gates were consumed with fire .
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	14	And I went on to the fountain-gate , and to the king 's pool ; and there was no place for the beast under me to pass .
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	15	And I went up in the night through the valley , and viewed the wall , and turned back , and entered by the valley-gate and returned .
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	16	And the rulers did not know whither I went or what I did , for I had not as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the nobles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest that did the work .
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	17	And I said to them , Ye see the distress that we are in , that Jerusalem lies waste , and its gates are burned with fire . Come , and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem , that we be no more a reproach .
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	18	And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me ; as also of the king 's words which he had said unto me . And they said , Let us rise up and build . And they strengthened their hands for the good [ work ] .
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	19	And Sanballat the Horonite , and Tobijah the servant , the Ammonite , and Geshem the Arabian , heard it ; and they mocked us and despised us , and said , What is this thing which ye do ? will ye rebel against the king ?
DARBY	Nehemiah	2	20	And I answered them , and said to them , The God of the heavens , he will prosper us , and we his servants will arise and build ; but ye have no portion , nor right , nor memorial in Jerusalem .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	3	And the fish-gate did the sons of Senaah build : they laid its beams , and set up its doors , its locks and its bars .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	2	And next to them built the men of Jericho . And next to them built Zaccur the son of Imri .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	4	And next to them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah , the son of Koz . And next to them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah , the son of Meshezabeel . And next to them repaired Zadok the son of Baana .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	5	And next to them the Tekoites repaired ; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	6	And the gate of the old [ wall ] repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah , and Meshullam the son of Besodiah ; they laid its beams , and set up its doors , and its locks , and its bars .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	7	And next to them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite , and Jadon the Meronothite , the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah , to the seat of the governor on this side the river .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	8	Next to them repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah , of the goldsmiths ; and next to him repaired Hananiah of the perfumers , and they left Jerusalem [ in its state ] as far as the broad wall .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	9	And next to them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur , the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	10	And next to them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph , even over against his house . And next to him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabniah .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	11	Malchijah the son of Harim and Hasshub the son of Pahath-Moab repaired a second piece , and the tower of the furnaces .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	12	And next to them repaired Shallum the son of Hallohesh , the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem , he and his daughters .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	13	The valley-gate repaired Hanun , and the inhabitants of Zanoah ; they built it , and set up its doors , its locks and its bars , and a thousand cubits of the wall as far as the dung-gate .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	14	And the dung-gate repaired Malchijah the son of Rechab , the chief of the district of Beth-haccerem ; he built it , and set up its doors , its locks and its bars .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	15	And the fountain-gate repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh , the chief of the district of Mizpah ; he built it , and covered it , and set up its doors , its locks and its bars , and the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king 's garden , and to the stairs that go down from the city of David .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	16	After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk , the chief of the half district of Beth-zur , even over against the sepulchres of David , and to the pool that was made , and to the house of the mighty [ men ] .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	17	After him repaired the Levites , Rehum the son of Bani . Next to him repaired Hashabiah , the chief of the half district of Keilah , for his district .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	18	After him repaired their brethren , Bavvai the son of Henadad , the chief of the half district of Keilah .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	19	And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua , the ruler of Mizpah , a second piece over against the going up to the armoury at the angle .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	20	After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired another piece , from the angle to the entry of the house of Eliashib the high priest .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	21	After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah , the son of Koz , another piece , from the door of the house of Eliashib as far as the end of the house of Eliashib .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	22	And after him repaired the priests , the men of the plain [ of Jordan ] .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	23	After them repaired Benjamin and Hasshub over against their house . After them repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah , the son of Ananiah , by his house .

DARBY	Nehemiah	3	25	Palal the son of Uzai , over against the angle , and the high tower that lies out from the king 's house , which was by the court of the prison . After him , Pedaiah the son of Parosh .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	26	( Now the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel , even over against the water-gate toward the east , and the tower which lies out . )
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	27	After him the Tekoites repaired a second piece , over against the great tower which lies out , as far as the wall of Ophel .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	28	From above the horse-gate repaired the priests , every one over against his house .
DARBY	Nehemiah	3	29	After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his house . And after him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah , the keeper of the east gate .

DARBY	Nehemiah	3	32	And between the ascent of the corner and the sheep-gate repaired the goldsmiths and the dealers .
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	4	Hear , our God , for we are despised , and turn their reproach upon their own head , and give them for a prey in a land of captivity !
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	2	And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria , and said , What do these feeble Jews ? shall they be permitted to go on ? Will they offer sacrifices ? Will they finish in a day ? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish , when they are burned ?
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	3	And Tobijah the Ammonite was by him , and he said , Even that which they build , if a fox went up , it would break down their stone wall.—
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	5	And cover not their iniquity , and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee ; for they have provoked the builders .
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	6	But we built the wall ; and all the wall was joined together to the half thereof ; for the people had a mind to work .
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	7	And it came to pass , when Sanballat , and Tobijah , and the Arabians , and the Ammonites , and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being repaired , that the breaches began to be stopped , then they were very wroth ,
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	8	and conspired all of them together to come to fight against Jerusalem , and to hinder it .
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	9	Then we prayed to our God , and set a watch against them day and night , because of them .
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	10	And Judah said , The strength of the bearers of burdens faileth , and there is much rubbish ; so that we are not able to build at the wall .
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	11	And our adversaries said , They shall not know , neither see , till we come into the midst of them and kill them , and put an end to the work .
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	12	And it came to pass that when the Jews that dwelt by them came and told us so ten times , from all the places whence they returned to us ,
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	13	I set in the lower places behind the wall in exposed places , I even set the people , according to their families , with their swords , their spears and their bows .
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	14	And I looked , and rose up , and said to the nobles , and to the rulers , and to the rest of the people , Be not afraid of them : remember the Lord who is great and terrible , and fight for your brethren , your sons and your daughters , your wives and your houses .
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	15	And it came to pass that when our enemies heard that it was known to us , and that God had defeated their counsel , we returned all of us to the wall , every one to his work .
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	16	And from that time forth the half of my servants wrought in the work , and the other half of them held the spears , and the shields , and the bows , and the corslets ; and the captains were behind all the house of Judah .
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	17	They that built on the wall , and they that bore burdens , with those that loaded , wrought in the work with one hand , and with the other they held a weapon .
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	18	And the builders had every one his sword girded by his side , and built . And he that sounded the trumpet was by me .
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	19	And I said to the nobles , and to the rulers , and to the rest of the people , The work is great and extended , and we are scattered upon the wall , one far from another :
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	20	in what place ye hear the sound of the trumpet , thither shall ye assemble to us ; our God will fight for us .
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	21	And we laboured in the work ; and half of them held the spears from the rising of the dawn till the stars appeared .
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	22	Likewise at the same time I said to the people , Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and [ be for ] labour in the day .
DARBY	Nehemiah	4	23	And neither I , nor my brethren , nor my servants , nor the men of the guard that followed me , none of us put off our garments : every one had his weapon on his right side .
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	5	yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren , our children as their children ; and behold , we must bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants , and some of our daughters are brought into bondage [ already ] ; neither is it in the power of our hand [ to redeem them ] , for other men have our fields and our vineyards .
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	2	And there were that said , We , our sons and our daughters , are many , and we must procure corn that we may eat and live .
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	3	And there were that said , We have had to pledge our fields , and our vineyards , and our houses , that we might procure corn in the dearth .
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	4	And there were that said , We have borrowed money for the king 's tribute upon our fields and vineyards ;
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	6	And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words .
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	7	And I consulted with myself ; and I remonstrated with the nobles and the rulers , and said to them , Ye exact usury , every one of his brother ! And I set a great assembly against them .
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	8	And I said to them , We , according to our ability , have redeemed our brethren the Jews , who were sold to the nations ; and will ye even sell your brethren ? or shall they be sold unto us ? And they were silent and found no answer .
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	9	And I said , The thing that ye do is not good . Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God , so as not to be the reproach of the nations our enemies ?
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	10	I also , my brethren and my servants , we might exact usury of them , money and corn . I pray you , let us leave off this usury .
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	11	Restore , I pray you , to them this very day their fields , their vineyards , their olive-gardens , and their houses , also the hundredth [ part ] of the money , and of the corn , the wine and the oil , that ye have exacted of them .
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	12	And they said , We will restore [ them ] , and will require nothing of them ; so will we do , as thou hast said . And I called the priests , and took an oath of them , that they should do according to this promise .
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	13	Also I shook my lap , and said , So God shake out every man from his house and from his earnings , that performeth not this promise : even thus be he shaken out and emptied ! And all the congregation said , Amen ! And they praised Jehovah . And the people did according to this promise .
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	14	Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah , from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king , twelve years , I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor .
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	15	But the former governors that were before me had been chargeable to the people , and had taken of them bread and wine , besides forty shekels of silver : even their servants bore rule over the people . But I did not so , because of the fear of God .
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	16	Yea , also I applied myself to this work of the wall , and we bought no fields ; and all my servants were gathered thither for the work .
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	17	And there were at my table a hundred and fifty of the Jews and the rulers , besides those that came to us from among the nations that were about us .
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	18	And that which was prepared daily was one ox [ and ] six choice sheep ; also fowls were prepared for me , and once in ten days all sorts of wine in abundance . Yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor ; for the service was heavy upon this people .
DARBY	Nehemiah	5	19	Remember for me , my God , for good , all that I have done for this people .
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	6	in which was written : It is reported among the nations , and Gashmu says [ it , that ] thou and the Jews think to rebel , for which cause thou buildest the wall , and according to these words thou wilt become their king .
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	2	that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me , saying , Come , let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono . But they thought to do me mischief .
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	3	And I sent messengers to them , saying , I am doing a great work , and I can not come down . Why should the work cease , whilst I leave it and come down to you ?
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	4	And they sent to me four times after this sort ; and I answered them in the same manner .
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	5	Then sent Sanballat his servant to me in this manner the fifth time , with an open letter in his hand ,
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	7	And thou hast also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning thee at Jerusalem saying , There is a king in Judah ! And now it will be reported to the king according to these words . Come now therefore , and let us take counsel together .
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	8	And I sent to him , saying , There are no such things done as thou sayest , but thou feignest them out of thine own heart .
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	9	For they all would have made us afraid , saying , Their hands shall be slackened from the work , that it be not carried out.—Now therefore strengthen my hands !
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	10	And I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah , the son of Mehetabeel , who had shut himself up . And he said , Let us meet together in the house of God , within the temple , and let us shut the doors of the temple ; for they are coming to kill thee ; even in the night are they coming to kill thee .
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	11	And I said , Should such a man as I flee ? and who is there , that , being as I am , could go into the temple , and live ? I will not go in .
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	12	And I perceived , and behold , God had not sent him ; for he pronounced this prophecy against me ; and Tobijah and Sanballat had hired him .
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	13	Therefore was he hired , that I should be afraid , and do so , and sin , and that they might have wherewith to spread an evil report , that they might reproach me .
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	14	My God , remember Tobijah and Sanballat according to these their works , and also the prophetess Noadiah , and the rest of the prophets who would have put me in fear .
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	15	So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth of Elul , in fifty-two days .
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	16	And it came to pass that when all our enemies heard [ of it ] , all the nations that were about us were afraid and were much cast down in their own eyes , and they perceived that this work was wrought by our God .
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	17	Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobijah , and those of Tobijah came to them .
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	18	For there were many in Judah sworn to him ; for he was a son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah ; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah .
DARBY	Nehemiah	6	19	Also they spoke of his good deeds before me , and reported my words to him . [ And ] Tobijah sent letters to put me in fear .
DARBY	Nehemiah	7	7	those who came with Zerubbabel , Jeshua , Nehemiah , Azariah , Raamiah , Nahamani , Mordecai , Bilshan , Mispereth , Bigvai , Nehum , Baanah . The number of the men of the people of Israel :
DARBY	Nehemiah	7	2	And I gave my brother Hanani , and Hananiah the ruler of the citadel , charge over Jerusalem ; for he was a faithful man and feared God above many .
DARBY	Nehemiah	7	3	And I said to them that the gates of Jerusalem should not be opened until the sun was hot , and that they should shut the doors and bar them while they stood by ; and that there should be appointed watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem , every one in his watch , and every one over against his house .
DARBY	Nehemiah	7	4	Now the city was large and great ; but the people in it were few , and no houses were built .
DARBY	Nehemiah	7	5	And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles , and the rulers , and the people , for registration by genealogy . And I found a genealogical register of those that had come up at the first , and I found written in it :
DARBY	Nehemiah	7	6	These are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away , and who came again to Jerusalem and to Judah , every one to his city ;
DARBY	Nehemiah	7	8	The children of Parosh , two thousand one hundred and seventy-two .
DARBY	Nehemiah	7	9	The children of Shephatiah , three hundred and seventy-two .
DARBY	Nehemiah	7	10	The children of Arah , six hundred and fifty-two .
DARBY	Nehemiah	7	11	The children of Pahath-Moab , of the children of Jeshua and Joab , two thousand eight hundred and eighteen .
DARBY	Nehemiah	7	12	The children of Elam , a thousand two hundred and fifty-four .
DARBY	Nehemiah	7	13	The children of Zattu , eight hundred and forty-five .
DARBY	Nehemiah	7	14	The children of Zaccai , seven hundred and sixty .
DARBY	Nehemiah	7	15	The children of Binnui , six hundred and forty-eight .
DARBY	Nehemiah	7	16	The children of Bebai , six hundred and twenty-eight .
DARBY	Nehemiah	7	17	The children of Azgad , two thousand three hundred and twenty-two .

DARBY	Nehemiah	8	8	And they read in the law of God distinctly out of the book , and gave the sense , and caused [ them ] to understand the reading .
DARBY	Nehemiah	8	2	And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation , both of men and women , and all that could hear with understanding , on the first day of the seventh month .

DARBY	Nehemiah	9	6	Thou art the Same , thou alone , Jehovah , who hast made the heaven of heavens , and all their host , the earth and all that is therein , the seas and all that is therein . And thou quickenest them all ; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	7	Thou art the Same , Jehovah Elohim , who didst choose Abram and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees , and gavest him the name of Abraham ;
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	8	and foundest his heart faithful before thee , and madest the covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Jebusites , and the Girgashites , —to give it to his seed ; and thou hast performed thy words , for thou art righteous .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	10	and didst shew signs and wonders upon Pharaoh , and upon all his servants , and upon all the people of his land ; for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them , and thou didst make thee a name , as it is this day .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	11	And thou didst divide the sea before them , and they went through the midst of the sea on dry [ ground ] ; and their pursuers thou threwest into the depths , as a stone into the mighty waters .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	12	And thou leddest them in the day by a pillar of cloud , and in the night by a pillar of fire , to give them light in the way wherein they should go .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	13	And thou camest down on mount Sinai , and didst speak with them from the heavens , and gavest them right judgments and true laws , good statutes and commandments .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	14	And thou madest known unto them thy holy sabbath , and prescribedst for them commandments and statutes and a law , through Moses thy servant .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	15	And thou gavest them bread from the heavens for their hunger , and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst , and didst say to them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	16	But they , our fathers , dealt proudly , and hardened their neck , and hearkened not to thy commandments ,
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	17	and refused to obey , neither were they mindful of thy wonders which thou hadst done among them ; but hardened their neck , and in their rebellion made a captain to return to their bondage . But thou art a +God ready to forgive , gracious and merciful , slow to anger and of great loving-kindness , and thou forsookest them not .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	18	Yea , when they had made them a molten calf , and said , This is thy god that brought thee up out of Egypt ! and they had wrought great provocation ,
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	19	yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness . The pillar of the cloud departed not from over them by day , to lead them on the way ; neither the pillar of fire by night , to shew them light , and the way wherein they should go .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	20	Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them , and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth , and gavest them water for their thirst .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	21	Yea , forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness ; they lacked nothing ; their clothes grew not old , and their feet swelled not .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	22	And thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples , and didst divide them by countries ; and they possessed the land of Sihon , as well the land of the king of Heshbon , as the land of Og king of Bashan .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	23	And their children thou didst multiply as the stars of heaven , and thou broughtest them into the land concerning which thou didst say to their fathers that they should go in to possess it .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	24	And the children went in and possessed the land ; and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , and gavest them into their hands , both their kings and the peoples of the land , that they might do with them as they would .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	25	And they took strong cities , and a fat land , and possessed houses full of all good things , wells digged , vineyards and olive-gardens , and fruit trees in abundance . And they did eat and were filled , and became fat , and delighted themselves in thy great goodness .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	26	But they were disobedient , and rebelled against thee , and cast thy law behind their backs , and slew thy prophets who testified against them to turn them to thee , and they wrought great provocations .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	27	And thou gavest them into the hand of their oppressors , and they oppressed them ; and in the time of their distress , when they cried unto thee , thou heardest them from the heavens , and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours , who saved them out of the hand of their oppressors .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	28	But when they had rest , they did evil again before thee ; and thou didst leave them in the hand of their enemies , and they had dominion over them ; and again they cried unto thee , and thou heardest [ them ] from the heavens , and many times didst thou deliver them , according to thy mercies .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	29	And thou testifiedst against them , that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law ; but they dealt proudly , and hearkened not unto thy commandments , but sinned against thine ordinances ( which if a man do , he shall live in them ) ; and they withdrew the shoulder , and hardened their neck , and would not hear .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	30	And many years didst thou forbear with them , and testifiedst against them by thy Spirit through thy prophets ; but they would not give ear : and thou gavest them into the hand of the peoples of the lands .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	31	Nevertheless for thy manifold mercies ' sake , thou didst not make a full end of them nor forsake them ; for thou art a gracious and merciful God .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	32	And now , our God , the great , the mighty , and the terrible God , who keepest covenant and loving-kindness , let not all the trouble seem little before thee , that hath come upon us , on our kings , on our princes , and on our priests , and on our prophets , and on our fathers , and on all thy people , since the days of the kings of Assyria unto this day .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	33	But thou art just in all that is come upon us ; for thou hast acted according to truth , and we have done wickedly .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	34	And our kings , our princes , our priests , and our fathers , have not performed thy law , nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies , wherewith thou didst testify against them .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	35	And they have not served thee in their kingdom , and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them , and in the large and fat land that thou didst set before them , neither turned they from their wicked works .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	36	Behold , we are servants this day , and the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof , behold , we are bondmen in it .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	37	And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins : and they have dominion over our bodies , and over our cattle , at their pleasure ; and we are in great distress .
DARBY	Nehemiah	9	38	And because of all this we make a sure covenant , and write it ; and our princes , our Levites , [ and ] our priests are at the sealing .

DARBY	Nehemiah	12	8	And the Levites : Jeshua , Binnui , Kadmiel , Sherebiah , Judah , Mattaniah , [ who was ] over the thanksgiving , he and his brethren ;
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	9	and Bakbukiah and Unni , their brethren , were over against them as watches .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	10	And Jeshua begot Joiakim , and Joiakim begot Eliashib , and Eliashib begot Joiada ,
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	11	and Joiada begot Jonathan , and Jonathan begot Jaddua .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	13	of Ezra , Meshullam ; of Amariah , Jehohanan ;

DARBY	Nehemiah	12	22	of the Levites , the chief fathers were recorded in the days of Eliashib , Joiada , and Johanan , and Jaddua , and the priests , until the reign of Darius the Persian .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	23	The children of Levi , the chief fathers , were recorded in the book of the chronicles , even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	24	And the chief Levites : Hashabiah , Sherebiah , and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel , with their brethren over against them , to praise [ and ] to give thanks , according to the commandment of David the man of God , ward over against ward .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	25	Mattaniah and Bakbukiah , Obadiah , Meshullam , Talmon , Akkub , were doorkeepers keeping the ward at the storehouses of the gates .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	26	These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and in the days of Nehemiah the governor , and of Ezra the priest , the scribe .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	27	And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places , to bring them to Jerusalem , to hold the dedication with gladness , both with thanksgivings , and with singing , [ with ] cymbals , lutes and harps .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	28	And the children of the singers were assembled , both from the plain [ of Jordan ] round about Jerusalem , and from the villages of the Netophathites ,
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	29	also from Beth-Gilgal , and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth ; for the singers had built themselves hamlets round about Jerusalem .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	30	And the priests and the Levites purified themselves ; and they purified the people , and the gates and the wall .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	31	And I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall , and appointed two great choirs and processions , on the right hand upon the wall towards the dung-gate .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	32	And after them went Hoshaiah , and half of the princes of Judah ,
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	33	and Azariah , Ezra , and Meshullam ,
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	34	Judah and Benjamin , and Shemaiah , and Jeremiah ,
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	35	and [ certain ] of the priests ' sons with trumpets : Zechariah the son of Jonathan , the son of Shemaiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Micaiah , the son of Zaccur , the son of Asaph ;
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	36	and his brethren , Shemaiah , and Azareel , Milalai , Gilalai , Maai , Nethaneel , and Judah , Hanani , with the musical instruments of David the man of God ; and Ezra the scribe before them .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	37	And at the fountain-gate , and over against them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the ascent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water-gate eastward .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	38	And the second choir went in the opposite direction upon the wall , and I after them , and the half of the people , from beyond the tower of the furnaces even to the broad wall ;
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	39	and from above the gate of Ephraim , and above the gate of the old [ wall ] , and above the fish-gate , and the tower of Hananeel , and the tower of Meah , even to the sheep-gate ; and they stood still in the prison-gate .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	40	And both choirs stood in the house of God , and I , and the half of the rulers with me ;
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	41	and the priests , Eliakim , Maaseiah , Miniamin , Micaiah , Elioenai , Zechariah , Hananiah , with trumpets ;
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	42	and Maaseiah , and Shemaiah , and Eleazar , and Uzzi , and Jehohanan , and Malchijah , and Elam , and Ezer . And the singers sang loud ; and Jizrahiah was their overseer .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	43	And that day they offered great sacrifices , and rejoiced : for God had made them rejoice with great joy ; and also the women and the children rejoiced . And the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	44	And at that time men were appointed over the chambers of the treasures for the heave-offerings , for the first-fruits , and for the tithes , to gather into them , out of the fields of the cities , the portions assigned by the law for the priests and the Levites ; for Judah rejoiced over the priests , and over the Levites that waited .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	45	And , with the singers and the doorkeepers , they kept the ward of their God , and the ward of the purification , according to the commandment of David [ and ] of Solomon his son .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	46	For of old , in the days of David and Asaph , there were the chiefs of the singers , and songs of praise and thanksgivings to God .
DARBY	Nehemiah	12	47	And all Israel , in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah , gave the portions of the singers and the doorkeepers , every day what was needed , and they consecrated things for the Levites ; and the Levites consecrated for the children of Aaron .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	13	And I made storekeepers over the storehouses : Shelemiah the priest , and Zadok the scribe , and of the Levites , Pedaiah ; and subordinate to them , Hanan the son of Zaccur , the son of Mattaniah ; for they were esteemed faithful , and their office was to distribute to their brethren .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	2	because they had not met the children of Israel with bread and with water , and had hired Balaam against them , to curse them ; but our God turned the curse into blessing .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	3	And it came to pass , when they heard the law , that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	4	And before this , Eliashib the priest , who had the oversight of the chambers of the house of our God , a kinsman of Tobijah ,
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	5	had prepared for him a great chamber , where formerly they laid the oblations , the frankincense , and the vessels , and the tithes of the corn , the new wine and the oil , which was commanded for the Levites and the singers and the doorkeepers , and the heave-offerings of the priests .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	6	And during all that [ time ] I was not at Jerusalem ; for in the two-and-thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I came to the king ; and after some time I obtained leave of the king .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	7	And I came to Jerusalem , and observed the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobijah , in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	8	And it grieved me much , and I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobijah out of the chamber .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	9	And I commanded , and they purified the chambers ; and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God , the oblation and the frankincense .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	10	And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given , and that the Levites and the singers that did the work had fled every one to his field .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	11	Then I contended with the rulers , and said , Why is the house of God forsaken ? And I gathered them together and set them in their place .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	12	And all Judah brought the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil into the storehouses .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	14	Remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wipe not out my good deeds which I have done for the house of my God , and for the charges thereof !
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	15	In those days I saw in Judah some treading winepresses on the sabbath , and bringing in sheaves , and lading them on asses ; as also wine , grapes and figs , and all manner of burdens ; and they brought them into Jerusalem on the sabbath day ; and I protested in the day on which they sold the victuals .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	16	Men of Tyre also dwelt therein , who brought fish and all manner of ware , and sold it on the sabbath to the children of Judah , and in Jerusalem .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	17	And I contended with the nobles of Judah , and said to them , What evil thing is this which ye do , profaning the sabbath day ?
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	18	Did not your fathers thus , and did not our God bring all this evil upon us and upon this city ? And ye will bring more wrath against Israel by profaning the sabbath .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	19	And it came to pass , that when it began to be dark in the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath , I commanded that the gates should be shut ; and I commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath . And I set [ some ] of my servants at the gates , so that no burden should be brought in on the sabbath day .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	20	And the dealers and sellers of all kind of ware passed the night without Jerusalem once or twice .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	21	And I testified against them , and said to them , Why do ye pass the night before the wall ? if ye do so again , I will lay hands on you . From that time forth they came not on the sabbath .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	22	And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves , and that they should come and keep the gates , to hallow the sabbath day . Remember this also for me , my God , and spare me according to thy great loving-kindness !
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	23	In those days also I saw Jews that had married wives of Ashdod , of Ammon , [ and ] of Moab .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	24	And their children spoke half in the language of Ashdod , and could not speak in the Jews ' language , but according to the language of each people .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	25	And I contended with them , and cursed them , and smote certain of them and plucked off their hair , and adjured them by God [ saying ] , Ye shall not give your daughters to their sons , nor take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	26	Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things ? Yet among the many nations was there no king like him , who was beloved of his God , and God made him king over all Israel ; but even him did foreign wives cause to sin .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	27	And should we hearken to you to do all this great evil , to act unfaithfully to our God by marrying foreign wives ?
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	28	And [ one ] of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite ; and I chased him from me .
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	29	Remember them , my God , for they are polluters of the priesthood , and of the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites !
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	30	And I purified them from all foreigners , and appointed the charges of the priests and the Levites , every one in his service ;
DARBY	Nehemiah	13	31	and for the wood-offering , at times appointed , and for the first-fruits . Remember me , O my God , for good !
DARBY	Esther	1	1	And it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus ( that is , the Ahasuerus that reigned from India even to Ethiopia , over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces ) ,
DARBY	Esther	1	2	in those days , when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Shushan the fortress ,
DARBY	Esther	1	3	in the third year of his reign , he made a feast to all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the nobles and the princes of the provinces being before him ;
DARBY	Esther	1	4	when he shewed the glorious wealth of his kingdom and the splendid magnificence of his grandeur many days , a hundred and eighty days .
DARBY	Esther	1	5	And when these days were expired , the king made a feast to all the people that were present in Shushan the fortress , both to great and small , seven days , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace .
DARBY	Esther	1	6	White , green , and blue [ hangings ] were fastened with cords of byssus and purple to silver rings and pillars of white marble ; couches of gold and silver [ lay ] upon a pavement of red and white marble , and alabaster , and black marble .
DARBY	Esther	1	7	And they gave drink in vessels of gold ( the vessels being diverse one from another ) , and royal wine in abundance , according to the king 's bounty .
DARBY	Esther	1	8	And the drinking was , according to commandment , without constraint ; for so the king had appointed to all the magnates of his house , that they should do according to every man 's pleasure .
DARBY	Esther	1	9	Also the queen Vashti made a feast for the women of the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus .
DARBY	Esther	1	10	On the seventh day , when the king 's heart was merry with wine , he commanded Mehuman , Biztha , Harbona , Bigtha , and Abagtha , Zethar , and Carcas , the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of king Ahasuerus ,
DARBY	Esther	1	11	to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown to shew the peoples and the princes her beauty ; for she was of beautiful countenance .
DARBY	Esther	1	12	But the queen Vashti refused to come at the word of the king which was [ sent ] by the chamberlains ; and the king was very wroth , and his fury burned in him .
DARBY	Esther	1	13	And the king said to the wise men who knew the times ( for so was the king 's business [ conducted ] before all that knew law and judgment ;
DARBY	Esther	1	14	and the next to him were Carshena , Shethar , Admatha , Tarshish , Meres , Marsena , [ and ] Memucan , the seven princes of Persia and Media , who saw the king 's face , and who sat first in the kingdom ) ,
DARBY	Esther	1	15	What shall be done to the queen Vashti according to law , because she has not performed the word of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains ?
DARBY	Esther	1	16	Then said Memucan before the king and the princes , The queen Vashti has not done wrong to the king only , but also to all the princes , and to all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus .
DARBY	Esther	1	17	For the act of the queen will come abroad to all women , so as to render their husbands contemptible in their eyes , when they shall say , The king Ahasuerus commanded the queen Vashti to be brought in before him , and she came not !
DARBY	Esther	1	18	And the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen 's act , will say it this day to all the king 's princes , and there will be contempt and anger enough .
DARBY	Esther	1	19	If it please the king , let a royal order go forth from him , and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes , that it may not pass , That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus ; and let the king give her royal estate to another that is better than she ;
DARBY	Esther	1	20	and when the king 's edict which he shall make shall be heard throughout his realm—for it is great—all the wives shall give to their husbands honour , from the greatest to the least .
DARBY	Esther	1	21	And the saying pleased the king and the princes ; and the king did according to the word of Memucan .
DARBY	Esther	1	22	And he sent letters into all the king 's provinces , into every province according to the writing thereof , and to every people according to their language , That every man should bear rule in his own house , and should speak according to the language of his people .
DARBY	Esther	2	2	Then said the king 's servants that attended upon him , Let there be maidens , virgins of beautiful countenance , sought for the king ;
DARBY	Esther	2	3	and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom , that they may gather together all the young virgins of beautiful countenance to Shushan the fortress , to the house of the women , unto the custody of Hegai the king 's chamberlain , keeper of the women ; and let their things for purification be given .
DARBY	Esther	2	4	And let the maiden that pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti . And the thing pleased the king ; and he did so .
DARBY	Esther	2	5	There was in Shushan the fortress a certain Jew , whose name was Mordecai , the son of Jair , the son of Shimei , the son of Kish , a Benjaminite ,
DARBY	Esther	2	6	who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah , whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away .
DARBY	Esther	2	7	And he brought up Hadassah , that is , Esther , his uncle 's daughter ; for she had neither father nor mother—and the maiden was fair and beautiful—and when her father and mother were dead , Mordecai took her for his own daughter .
DARBY	Esther	2	8	And it came to pass when the king 's commandment and his decree was heard , and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the fortress , unto the custody of Hegai , that Esther also was brought into the king 's house , unto the custody of Hegai , keeper of the women .
DARBY	Esther	2	9	And the maiden pleased him , and obtained favour before him ; and he speedily gave her her things for purification , and her portions , and the seven maidens selected to be given her , out of the king 's house ; and he removed her and her maids to the best [ place ] of the house of the women .
DARBY	Esther	2	10	Esther had not made known her people nor her birth ; for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known .
DARBY	Esther	2	11	And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women 's house , to know how Esther did , and what should become of her .
DARBY	Esther	2	12	And when every maiden 's turn came to go in to king Ahasuerus after that she had been treated for twelve months , according to the manner of the women ( for so were the days of their purification accomplished—six months with oil of myrrh , and six months with spices , and with things for the purifying of the women ,
DARBY	Esther	2	13	and thus came the maiden in unto the king ) , whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women to the king 's house .
DARBY	Esther	2	14	In the evening she went , and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women , unto the custody of Shaashgaz , the king 's chamberlain , keeper of the concubines . She came in to the king no more , unless the king delighted in her , and she were called by name .
DARBY	Esther	2	15	And when the turn of Esther , the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai , who had taken her for his daughter , came to go in to the king , she required nothing but what Hegai the king 's chamberlain , keeper of the women , appointed . And Esther obtained grace in the sight of all them that saw her .
DARBY	Esther	2	16	So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus , into his royal house , in the tenth month , that is , the month Tebeth , in the seventh year of his reign .
DARBY	Esther	2	17	And the king loved Esther above all the women , and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins , and he set the royal crown upon her head , and made her queen instead of Vashti .
DARBY	Esther	2	18	And the king made a great feast to all his princes and his servants , Esther 's feast ; and he made a release to the provinces , and gave presents according to the king 's bounty .
DARBY	Esther	2	19	And when the virgins were gathered together the second time , Mordecai sat in the king 's gate .
DARBY	Esther	2	20	( Esther , as Mordecai had charged her , had not yet made known her birth nor her people ; for Esther did what Mordecai told her , like as when she was brought up with him . )
DARBY	Esther	2	21	In those days , while Mordecai sat in the king 's gate , two of the king 's chamberlains , Bigthan and Teresh , of those which kept the threshold , were wroth , and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus .
DARBY	Esther	2	22	And the thing became known to Mordecai , and he related it to Esther the queen , and Esther told it to the king in Mordecai 's name .
DARBY	Esther	2	23	And the matter was investigated and found out ; and they were both hanged on a tree . And it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king .
DARBY	Esther	3	3	Then the king 's servants , who were in the king 's gate , said to Mordecai , Why transgressest thou the king 's commandment ?
DARBY	Esther	3	2	And all the king 's servants that were in the king 's gate bowed and did Haman reverence , for the king had so commanded concerning him . But Mordecai bowed not , nor did [ him ] reverence .
DARBY	Esther	3	4	And it came to pass as they spoke daily to him , and he hearkened not to them , that they informed Haman , to see whether Mordecai 's matters would stand ; for he had told them that he was a Jew .
DARBY	Esther	3	5	And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence , Haman was full of fury .
DARBY	Esther	3	6	But he scorned to lay hands on Mordecai alone ; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai ; therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus—the people of Mordecai .
DARBY	Esther	3	7	In the first month , that is , the month Nisan , in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus , they cast Pur , that is , the lot , before Haman for each day and for each month , to the twelfth [ month ] , that is , the month Adar .
DARBY	Esther	3	8	And Haman said to king Ahasuerus , There is a people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom ; and their laws are diverse from [ those of ] every people , and they keep not the king 's laws ; and it is not for the king 's profit to suffer them .
DARBY	Esther	3	9	If it please the king , let it be written that they may be destroyed , and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those that have charge of the affairs , to bring [ it ] into the king 's treasuries .
DARBY	Esther	3	10	And the king took his ring from his hand , and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the Jews ' enemy .
DARBY	Esther	3	11	And the king said to Haman , The silver is given to thee , the people also , to do with them as seems good to thee .
DARBY	Esther	3	12	Then were the king 's scribes called , in the first month , on the thirteenth day of the [ month ] , and there was written according to all that Haman commanded unto the king 's satraps , and to the governors over every province , and to the princes of every people ; to every province according to the writing thereof , and to every people according to their language : in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written , and sealed with the king 's ring .
DARBY	Esther	3	13	And the letters were sent by couriers into all the king 's provinces , to destroy , to kill , and to cause to perish , all Jews , both young and old , little children and women , in one day , upon the thirteenth of the twelfth month , that is , the month Adar , and [ to take ] the spoil of them for a prey .
DARBY	Esther	3	14	That the decree might be given in every province , a copy of the writing was published to all peoples , that they should be ready against that day .
DARBY	Esther	3	15	The couriers went out , being hastened by the king 's commandment , and the decree was given in Shushan the fortress . And the king and Haman sat down to drink ; but the city of Shushan was in consternation .
DARBY	Esther	4	4	And Esther 's maids and her chamberlains came and told [ it ] her ; and the queen was exceedingly grieved : and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai , and to take away his sackcloth from him ; but he received [ it ] not .
DARBY	Esther	4	2	and came even before the king 's gate ; for none might enter into the king 's gate clothed with sackcloth .
DARBY	Esther	4	3	And in every province , wherever the king 's commandment and his decree came , there was great mourning among the Jews , and fasting , and weeping , and wailing : many lay in sackcloth and ashes .
DARBY	Esther	4	5	Then Esther called for Hatach , [ one ] of the king 's chamberlains , whom he had appointed to wait upon her , and gave him a commandment to Mordecai , to know what it was , and why it was .
DARBY	Esther	4	6	And Hatach went forth to Mordecai , unto the public place of the city which was before the king 's gate .
DARBY	Esther	4	7	And Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him , and of the sum of money that Haman had promised to pay to the king 's treasuries for the Jews , to destroy them .
DARBY	Esther	4	8	And he gave him a copy of the writing of the decree that had been given at Shushan to destroy them , to shew [ it ] to Esther , and to declare [ it ] to her , and to charge her that she should go in unto the king , to make supplication to him , and to make request before him , for her people .
DARBY	Esther	4	9	And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai .
DARBY	Esther	4	10	And Esther spoke to Hatach , and gave him commandment unto Mordecai :
DARBY	Esther	4	11	All the king 's servants and the people of the king 's provinces do know that whoever , whether man or woman , shall come to the king into the inner court , who is not called , there is * one * law , to put [ him ] to death , except [ such ] to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre , that he may live ; and I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days .
DARBY	Esther	4	12	And they told Mordecai Esther 's words .
DARBY	Esther	4	13	And Mordecai bade to answer Esther : Imagine not in thy heart that thou shalt escape in the king 's house , more than all the Jews .
DARBY	Esther	4	14	For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time , then shall there arise relief and deliverance to the Jews from another place ; but thou and thy father 's house shall perish . And who knows whether thou art [ not ] come to the kingdom for such a time as this ?
DARBY	Esther	4	15	And Esther bade to answer Mordecai :
DARBY	Esther	4	16	Go , gather together all the Jews that are found in Shushan , and fast for me , and neither eat nor drink three days , night or day : I also and my maidens will fast likewise , and so will I go in unto the king , which is not according to the law ; and if I perish , I perish .
DARBY	Esther	4	17	And Mordecai went his way , and did according to all that Esther had commanded him .
DARBY	Esther	5	5	And the king said , Hasten Haman , that it may be done as Esther has said . And the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
DARBY	Esther	5	2	And it was so , when the king saw the queen Esther standing in the court , that she obtained grace in his sight ; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand ; and Esther drew near , and touched the top of the sceptre .
DARBY	Esther	5	3	And the king said to her , What wilt thou , queen Esther ? and what is thy request ? it shall be given thee even to the half of the kingdom .
DARBY	Esther	5	4	And Esther said , If it seem good to the king , let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him .
DARBY	Esther	5	6	And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine , What is thy petition ? and it shall be granted thee ; and what is thy request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be done .
DARBY	Esther	5	7	And Esther answered and said , My petition and my request is ,
DARBY	Esther	5	8	If I have found grace in the sight of the king , and if it please the king to grant my petition , and to perform my request , let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them , and I will do to-morrow according to the king 's word .
DARBY	Esther	5	9	And Haman went forth that day joyful and glad of heart ; but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king 's gate , that he stood not up nor moved for him , he was full of fury against Mordecai .
DARBY	Esther	5	10	But Haman controlled himself , and came home ; and he sent and called for his friends , and Zeresh his wife .
DARBY	Esther	5	11	And Haman told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and all wherein the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
DARBY	Esther	5	12	And Haman said , Yea , Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself ; and to-morrow also I am invited to her with the king .
DARBY	Esther	5	13	Yet all this is of no avail to me so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king 's gate .
DARBY	Esther	5	14	Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends to him , Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high , and in the morning speak to the king that Mordecai may be hanged on it : then go in merrily with the king to the banquet . And the thing pleased Haman ; and he caused the gallows to be made .
DARBY	Esther	6	6	So Haman came in . And the king said to him , What is to be done with the man whom the king delights to honour ? Now Haman thought in his heart , To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to me ?
DARBY	Esther	6	2	And it was found written , that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh , two of the king 's chamberlains , keepers of the threshold , who had sought to lay hand on king Ahasuerus .
DARBY	Esther	6	3	And the king said , What honour and dignity has been done to Mordecai for this ? And the king 's servants that attended upon him said , Nothing has been done for him .
DARBY	Esther	6	4	And the king said , Who is in the court ? Now Haman had come into the outward court of the king 's house , to speak to the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him .
DARBY	Esther	6	5	And the king 's servants said to him , Behold , Haman is standing in the court . And the king said , Let him come in .
DARBY	Esther	6	7	And Haman answered the king , For the man whom the king delights to honour ,
DARBY	Esther	6	8	let the royal apparel be brought with which the king arrays himself , and the horse that the king rides upon , and on the head of which the royal crown is set ;
DARBY	Esther	6	9	and let the apparel and horse be delivered into the hand of one of the king 's most noble princes , and let them array the man whom the king delights to honour , and cause him to ride on the horse through the street of the city , and proclaim before him , Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honour !
DARBY	Esther	6	10	And the king said to Haman , Make haste , take the apparel and the horse , as thou hast said , and do so to Mordecai the Jew , who sits at the king 's gate : let nothing fail of all that thou hast said .
DARBY	Esther	6	11	And Haman took the apparel and the horse , and arrayed Mordecai , and caused him to ride through the street of the city , and proclaimed before him , Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honour !
DARBY	Esther	6	12	And Mordecai came again to the king 's gate . But Haman hasted to his house , mourning and having his head covered .
DARBY	Esther	6	13	And Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and to all his friends all that had befallen him . Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife to him , If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews , before whom thou hast begun to fall , thou shalt not prevail against him , but wilt certainly fall before him .
DARBY	Esther	6	14	While they were yet talking with him , the king 's chamberlains came , and hasted to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared .
DARBY	Esther	7	7	And the king in his wrath rose up from the banquet of wine , [ and went ] into the palace garden ; but Haman stayed to make request for his life to Esther the queen , for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king .
DARBY	Esther	7	2	And the king said again to Esther on the second day , at the banquet of wine , What is thy petition , queen Esther ? and it shall be granted thee ; and what is thy request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be done .
DARBY	Esther	7	3	And Esther the queen answered and said , If I have found grace in thy sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request ;
DARBY	Esther	7	4	for we are sold , I and my people , to be destroyed , to be slain , and to perish . But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen , I had held my tongue , although the adversary could not compensate the king 's damage .
DARBY	Esther	7	5	And king Ahasuerus spoke and said to Esther the queen , Who is he , and where is he that has filled his heart to do so ?
DARBY	Esther	7	6	And Esther said , The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman . Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen .
DARBY	Esther	7	8	And the king returned out of the palace garden into the house of the banquet of wine , and Haman was fallen upon the couch on which Esther was . And the king said , Will he even force the queen before me in the house ? The word went forth out of the king 's mouth , and they covered Haman 's face .
DARBY	Esther	7	9	And Harbonah , one of the chamberlains , said before the king , Behold , also , the gallows fifty cubits high , that Haman made for Mordecai , who spoke good for the king , stands in the house of Haman . And the king said , Hang him on it !
DARBY	Esther	7	10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai . And the king 's wrath was appeased .
DARBY	Esther	8	8	Write ye then for the Jews as seems good to you , in the king 's name , and seal [ it ] with the king 's ring . For a writing that is written in the king 's name , and sealed with the king 's ring , can not be reversed .
DARBY	Esther	8	2	And the king took off his ring , which he had taken from Haman , and gave it to Mordecai . And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman .
DARBY	Esther	8	3	And Esther spoke yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite , and his device which he had devised against the Jews .
DARBY	Esther	8	4	And the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther . And Esther arose and stood before the king ,
DARBY	Esther	8	5	and said , If it please the king and if I have found grace before him , and the thing seem right to the king , and I be pleasing in his sight , let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , which he wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the king 's provinces .
DARBY	Esther	8	6	For how shall I endure to see the evil that shall befall my people ? and how shall I endure to see the destruction of my kindred ?
DARBY	Esther	8	7	And king Ahasuerus said to queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew , Behold , I have given Esther the house of Haman , and him they have hanged upon the gallows , because he stretched forth his hand against the Jews .
DARBY	Esther	8	9	Then were the king 's scribes called at that time , in the third month , that is , the month Sivan , on the three and twentieth [ day ] thereof ; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded , to the Jews , and to the satraps , and the governors , and the princes of the provinces which are from India even to Ethiopia , a hundred and twenty-seven provinces , to every province according to the writing thereof , and to every people according to their language , and to the Jews according to their writing and according to their language .
DARBY	Esther	8	10	And he wrote in the name of king Ahasuerus , and sealed [ it ] with the king 's ring , and sent letters by couriers on horseback riding on coursers , horses of blood reared in the breeding studs :
DARBY	Esther	8	11	[ stating ] that the king granted the Jews that were in every city to gather themselves together , and to stand for their life , to destroy , to slay , and to cause to perish , all the power of the people and province that might assault them , [ their ] little ones and women , and to [ take ] the spoil of them for a prey ,
DARBY	Esther	8	12	upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus , upon the thirteenth of the twelfth month , that is , the month Adar .
DARBY	Esther	8	13	That the decree might be given in every province , a copy of the writing was published to all the peoples , and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
DARBY	Esther	8	14	The couriers mounted on coursers [ and ] horses of blood went out , being hastened and pressed on by the king 's commandment . And the decree was given at Shushan the fortress .
DARBY	Esther	8	15	And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white , and with a great crown of gold , and with a mantle of byssus and purple ; and the city of Shushan shouted and was glad .
DARBY	Esther	8	16	The Jews had light , and joy , and gladness , and honour .
DARBY	Esther	8	17	And in every province , and in every city , wherever the king 's commandment and his decree came , the Jews had joy and gladness , a feast and a good day . And many among the peoples of the land became Jews ; for the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them .
DARBY	Esther	9	9	and Parmashta , and Arisai , and Aridai , and Vajezatha ,
DARBY	Esther	9	2	the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout the provinces of king Ahasuerus , to lay hand on such as sought their hurt . And no man could withstand them ; for the fear of them had fallen upon all the peoples .
DARBY	Esther	9	3	And all the princes of the provinces , and the satraps , and the governors and officers of the king , helped the Jews ; for the fear of Mordecai had fallen upon them .
DARBY	Esther	9	4	For Mordecai was great in the king 's house , and his fame went forth throughout the provinces ; for the man Mordecai became continually greater .
DARBY	Esther	9	5	And the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and slaughter and destruction , and did what they would to those that hated them .
DARBY	Esther	9	6	And in Shushan the fortress the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men .
DARBY	Esther	9	7	And Parshandatha , and Dalphon , and Aspatha ,
DARBY	Esther	9	8	and Poratha , and Adalia , and Aridatha ,
DARBY	Esther	9	10	the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha , the oppressor of the Jews , they slew ; but they laid not their hands on the prey .
DARBY	Esther	9	11	On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the fortress was brought before the king .
DARBY	Esther	9	12	And the king said to Esther the queen , The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the fortress , and the ten sons of Haman ; what have they done in the rest of the king 's provinces ? And what is thy petition ? and it shall be granted thee ; and what is thy request further ? and it shall be done .
DARBY	Esther	9	13	And Esther said , If it please the king , let it be granted to the Jews that are in Shushan to do to-morrow also according to this day 's decree , and let Haman 's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows .
DARBY	Esther	9	14	And the king commanded it so to be done : and the decree was given at Shushan ; and they hanged Haman 's ten sons .
DARBY	Esther	9	15	And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar , and slew three hundred men at Shushan ; but they laid not their hand on the prey .
DARBY	Esther	9	16	And the other Jews that were in the king 's provinces gathered themselves together , and stood for their life , and had rest from their enemies ; and they slew of them that hated them seventy-five thousand ( but they laid not their hand on the prey ) ,
DARBY	Esther	9	17	on the thirteenth day of the month Adar ; and on the fourteenth of the same they rested , and made it a day of feasting and joy .
DARBY	Esther	9	18	But the Jews that were at Shushan gathered themselves together on the thirteenth [ day ] thereof , and on the fourteenth thereof ; and on the fifteenth of the same they rested , and made it a day of feasting and joy .
DARBY	Esther	9	19	Therefore the Jews of the villages that dwell in the country towns make the fourteenth of the month Adar a day of joy and feasting , and a good day , and on which they send portions one to another .
DARBY	Esther	9	20	And Mordecai wrote these things , and sent letters to all the Jews near and far that were in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus ,
DARBY	Esther	9	21	to establish [ this ] among them , that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar , and the fifteenth day of the same , yearly ,
DARBY	Esther	9	22	as the days on which the Jews rested from their enemies , and the month that was turned to them from sorrow to joy , and from mourning into a good day ; that they should make them days of feasting and joy , and of sending portions one to another , and gifts to the poor .
DARBY	Esther	9	23	And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun , and as Mordecai had written to them .
DARBY	Esther	9	24	For Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the oppressor of all the Jews , had devised against the Jews to destroy them , and had cast Pur , that is , the lot , to consume them and to destroy them ;
DARBY	Esther	9	25	and when [ Esther ] came before the king , he commanded by letters that his wicked device , which he had devised against the Jews , should return upon his own head ; and they hanged him and his sons on the gallows .
DARBY	Esther	9	26	Therefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur . Therefore , according to all the words of this letter , and for what they had seen concerning this matter and what had happened to them ,
DARBY	Esther	9	27	the Jews ordained and took upon them , and upon their seed , and upon all such as joined themselves to them , so that it should not fail , that they would observe these two days according to their writing and according to their fixed time , every year ;
DARBY	Esther	9	28	and that these days should be remembered and observed throughout every generation , in every family , every province , and every city , and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews , nor the memorial of them cease from among their seed .
DARBY	Esther	9	29	And queen Esther the daughter of Abihail , and Mordecai the Jew , wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim .
DARBY	Esther	9	30	And he sent letters to all the Jews , to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus , words of peace and truth ,
DARBY	Esther	9	31	to confirm these days of Purim in their fixed times , according as Mordecai the Jew and queen Esther had enjoined them , and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed , as to the matters of the fastings and their cry .
DARBY	Esther	9	32	And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim ; and it was written in the book .
DARBY	Esther	10	10	And king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land and the isles of the sea .
DARBY	Esther	10	2	And all the acts of his power and of his might , and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai , to which the king advanced him , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia ?
DARBY	Esther	10	3	For Mordecai the Jew was second to king Ahasuerus , and great among the Jews , and accepted of the multitude of his brethren , seeking the welfare of his people , and speaking peace to all his seed .

DARBY	Job	1	1	There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job ; and this man was perfect and upright , and one that feared God and abstained from evil .
DARBY	Job	1	2	And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters .
DARBY	Job	1	3	And his substance was seven thousand sheep , and three thousand camels , and five hundred yoke of oxen , and five hundred she-asses , and very many servants ; and this man was greater than all the children of the east .
DARBY	Job	1	4	And his sons went and made a feast in the house of each one on his day ; and they sent and invited their three sisters to eat and to drink with them .
DARBY	Job	1	5	And it was so , when the days of the feasting were gone about , that Job sent and hallowed them ; and he rose up early in the morning , and offered up burnt-offerings [ according to ] the number of them all ; for Job said , It may be that my children have sinned , and cursed God in their hearts . Thus did Job continually .
DARBY	Job	1	6	And there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah ; and Satan came also among them .
DARBY	Job	1	7	And Jehovah said to Satan , Whence comest thou ? And Satan answered Jehovah and said , From going to and fro in the earth , and from walking up and down in it .
DARBY	Job	1	8	And Jehovah said to Satan , Hast thou considered my servant Job , that there is none like him on the earth , a perfect and an upright man , one that feareth God and abstaineth from evil ?
DARBY	Job	1	9	And Satan answered Jehovah and said , Doth Job fear God for nought ?
DARBY	Job	1	10	Hast not thou made a hedge about him , and about his house , and about all that he hath on every side ? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands , and his substance is spread abroad in the land .
DARBY	Job	1	11	But put forth thy hand now and touch all that he hath , [ and see ] if he will not curse thee to thy face !
DARBY	Job	1	12	And Jehovah said to Satan , Behold , all that he hath is in thy hand ; only upon himself put not forth thy hand . So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah .
DARBY	Job	1	13	And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother , the firstborn .
DARBY	Job	1	14	And there came a messenger to Job and said , The oxen were ploughing , and the asses feeding beside them ;
DARBY	Job	1	15	and [ they of ] Sheba fell [ upon them ] and took them , and the servants have they smitten with the edge of the sword ; and I only am escaped , alone , to tell thee .
DARBY	Job	1	16	While he was yet speaking , there came another and said , The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants , and consumed them ; and I only am escaped , alone , to tell thee .
DARBY	Job	1	17	While he was yet speaking , there came another and said , The Chaldeans made three bands , and fell upon the camels and took them , and the servants have they smitten with the edge of the sword ; and I only am escaped , alone , to tell thee .
DARBY	Job	1	18	While he was yet speaking , there came another and said , Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother , the firstborn ;
DARBY	Job	1	19	and behold , there came a great wind from over the wilderness , and smote the four corners of the house , and it fell upon the young men , and they died ; and I only am escaped , alone , to tell thee .
DARBY	Job	1	20	And Job rose up , and rent his mantle , and shaved his head , and fell down on the ground , and worshipped ;
DARBY	Job	1	21	and he said , Naked came I out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return thither : Jehovah gave , and Jehovah hath taken away ; blessed be the name of Jehovah !
DARBY	Job	1	22	In all this Job sinned not , nor ascribed anything unseemly to God .
DARBY	Job	2	2	And Jehovah said to Satan , From whence comest thou ? And Satan answered Jehovah and said , From going to and fro in the earth , and from walking up and down in it .
DARBY	Job	2	3	And Jehovah said to Satan , Hast thou considered my servant Job , that there is none like him on the earth , a perfect and an upright man , one that feareth God and abstaineth from evil ? and still he remaineth firm in his integrity , though thou movedst me against him , to swallow him up without cause .
DARBY	Job	2	4	And Satan answered Jehovah and said , Skin for skin , yea , all that a man hath will he give for his life ;
DARBY	Job	2	5	but put forth thy hand now , and touch his bone and his flesh , [ and see ] if he will not curse thee to thy face !
DARBY	Job	2	6	And Jehovah said to Satan , Behold , he is in thy hand ; only spare his life .
DARBY	Job	2	7	And Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah ; and he smote Job with a grievous botch from the sole of his foot unto his crown .
DARBY	Job	2	8	And he took a potsherd to scrape himself with ; and he sat among the ashes .
DARBY	Job	2	9	And his wife said to him , Dost thou still remain firm in thine integrity ? curse God and die .
DARBY	Job	2	10	But he said to her , Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh . We have also received good from God , and should we not receive evil ? In all this Job did not sin with his lips .
DARBY	Job	2	11	And three friends of Job heard of all this evil that was come upon him . And they came each one from his place : Eliphaz the Temanite , and Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite ; and they made an appointment together to come to condole with him and to comfort him .
DARBY	Job	2	12	And when they lifted up their eyes afar off , and knew him not , they lifted up their voice and wept . And they rent every one his mantle , and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward the heavens .
DARBY	Job	2	13	And they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights ; and none spoke a word to him ; for they saw that [ his ] anguish was very great .
DARBY	Job	3	3	Let the day perish in which I was born , and the night that said , There is a man child conceived .
DARBY	Job	3	2	And Job answered and said ,
DARBY	Job	3	4	That day—let it be darkness , let not +God care for it from above , neither let light shine upon it :
DARBY	Job	3	5	Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it ; let clouds dwell upon it ; let darkeners of the day terrify it .
DARBY	Job	3	6	That night—let gloom seize upon it ; let it not rejoice among the days of the year ; let it not come into the number of the months .
DARBY	Job	3	7	Behold , let that night be barren ; let no joyful sound come therein ;
DARBY	Job	3	8	Let them curse it that curse the day , who are ready to rouse Leviathan ;
DARBY	Job	3	9	Let the stars of its twilight be dark ; let it wait for light , and have none , neither let it see the eyelids of the dawn :
DARBY	Job	3	10	Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me , and hid not trouble from mine eyes .
DARBY	Job	3	11	Wherefore did I not die from the womb , —come forth from the belly and expire ?
DARBY	Job	3	12	Why did the knees meet me ? and wherefore the breasts , that I should suck ?
DARBY	Job	3	13	For now should I have lain down and been quiet ; I should have slept : then had I been at rest ,
DARBY	Job	3	14	With kings and counsellors of the earth , who build desolate places for themselves ,
DARBY	Job	3	15	Or with princes who had gold , who filled their houses with silver ;
DARBY	Job	3	16	Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been ; as infants that have not seen the light .
DARBY	Job	3	17	There the wicked cease from troubling ; and there the wearied are at rest .
DARBY	Job	3	18	The prisoners together are at ease ; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster .
DARBY	Job	3	19	The small and great are there , and the bondman freed from his master .
DARBY	Job	3	20	Wherefore is light given to him that is in trouble , and life to those bitter of soul ,
DARBY	Job	3	21	Who long for death , and it [ cometh ] not , and dig for it more than for hidden treasures ;
DARBY	Job	3	22	Who rejoice even exultingly and are glad when they find the grave ? —
DARBY	Job	3	23	To the man whose way is hidden , and whom +God hath hedged in ?
DARBY	Job	3	24	For my sighing cometh before my bread , and my groanings are poured out like the waters .
DARBY	Job	3	25	For I feared a fear , and it hath come upon me , and that which I dreaded hath come to me .
DARBY	Job	3	26	I was not in safety , neither had I quietness , neither was I at rest , and trouble came .
DARBY	Job	4	4	Thy words have upholden him that was stumbling , and thou hast braced up the bending knees :
DARBY	Job	4	2	If a word were essayed to thee , wouldest thou be grieved ? But who can refrain from speaking ?
DARBY	Job	4	3	Behold , thou hast instructed many , and thou hast strengthened the weak hands ;
DARBY	Job	4	5	But now it is come upon thee , and thou grievest ; it toucheth thee , and thou art troubled .
DARBY	Job	4	6	Hath not thy piety been thy confidence , and the perfection of thy ways thy hope ?
DARBY	Job	4	7	Remember , I pray thee , who that was innocent has perished ? and where were the upright cut off ?
DARBY	Job	4	8	Even as I have seen , they that plough iniquity and sow mischief , reap the same .
DARBY	Job	4	9	By the breath of +God they perish , and by the blast of his nostrils are they consumed .
DARBY	Job	4	10	The roar of the lion , and the voice of the fierce lion , and the teeth of the young lions , are broken ;
DARBY	Job	4	11	The old lion perisheth for lack of prey , and the whelps of the lioness are scattered .
DARBY	Job	4	12	Now to me a word was secretly brought , and mine ear received a whisper thereof .
DARBY	Job	4	13	In thoughts from visions of the night , when deep sleep falleth on men : —
DARBY	Job	4	14	Fear came on me , and trembling , and made all my bones to shake ;
DARBY	Job	4	15	And a spirit passed before my face—the hair of my flesh stood up—
DARBY	Job	4	16	It stood still ; I could not discern the appearance thereof : a form was before mine eyes ; I heard a slight murmur and a voice :
DARBY	Job	4	17	Shall [ mortal ] man be more just than +God ? Shall a man be purer than his Maker ?
DARBY	Job	4	18	Lo , he trusteth not his servants , and his angels he chargeth with folly :
DARBY	Job	4	19	How much more them that dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , who are crushed as the moth !
DARBY	Job	4	20	From morning to evening are they smitten : without any heeding it , they perish for ever .
DARBY	Job	4	21	Is not their tent-cord torn away in them ? they die , and without wisdom .
DARBY	Job	5	5	Whose harvest the hungry eateth up , and taketh even out of the thorns ; and the snare gapeth for his substance .
DARBY	Job	5	2	For vexation killeth the foolish man , and envy slayeth the simple .
DARBY	Job	5	3	I myself saw the foolish taking root , but suddenly I cursed his habitation .
DARBY	Job	5	4	His children are far from safety , and they are crushed in the gate , and there is no deliverer :
DARBY	Job	5	6	For evil cometh not forth from the dust , neither doth trouble spring out of the ground ;
DARBY	Job	5	7	For man is born to trouble , as the sparks fly upwards .
DARBY	Job	5	8	But as for me I will seek unto God , and unto God commit my cause ;
DARBY	Job	5	9	Who doeth great things and unsearchable , marvellous things without number ;
DARBY	Job	5	10	Who giveth rain on the face of the earth , and sendeth waters on the face of the fields ;
DARBY	Job	5	11	Setting up on high those that are low ; and mourners are exalted to prosperity .
DARBY	Job	5	12	He disappointeth the devices of the crafty , and their hands carry not out the enterprise .
DARBY	Job	5	13	He taketh the wise in their own craftiness ; and the counsel of the wily is carried headlong :
DARBY	Job	5	14	They meet with darkness in a the daytime , and grope at midday as in the night .
DARBY	Job	5	15	And he saveth the needy from the sword , from their mouth , and from the hand of the mighty .
DARBY	Job	5	16	So the poor hath what he hopeth for , and unrighteousness stoppeth her mouth .
DARBY	Job	5	17	Behold , happy is the man whom +God correcteth ; therefore despise not the chastening of the Almighty .
DARBY	Job	5	18	For he maketh sore , and bindeth up ; he woundeth , and his hands make whole .
DARBY	Job	5	19	He will deliver thee in six troubles , and in seven there shall no evil touch thee .
DARBY	Job	5	20	In famine he will redeem thee from death , and in war from the power of the sword .
DARBY	Job	5	21	Thou shalt be hidden from the scourge of the tongue ; and thou shalt not be afraid of destruction when it cometh .
DARBY	Job	5	22	At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh , and of the beasts of the earth thou shalt not be afraid .
DARBY	Job	5	23	For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field , and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee .
DARBY	Job	5	24	And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace ; and thou wilt survey thy fold , and miss nothing .
DARBY	Job	5	25	And thou shalt know that thy seed is numerous , and thine offspring as the herb of the earth .
DARBY	Job	5	26	Thou shalt come to the grave in a ripe age , as a shock of corn is brought in in its season .
DARBY	Job	5	27	Behold this , we have searched it out , so it is ; hear it , and know thou it for thyself .
DARBY	Job	6	6	Shall that which is insipid be eaten without salt ? Is there any taste in the white of an egg ?
DARBY	Job	6	2	Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed , and all my calamity laid in the balances !
DARBY	Job	6	3	For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas ; therefore my words are vehement .
DARBY	Job	6	4	For the arrows of the Almighty are within me , their poison drinketh up my spirit : the terrors of +God are arrayed against me .
DARBY	Job	6	5	Doth the wild ass bray by the grass ? loweth an ox over his fodder ?
DARBY	Job	6	7	What my soul refuseth to touch , that is as my loathsome food .
DARBY	Job	6	8	Oh that I might have my request , and that +God would grant my desire !
DARBY	Job	6	9	And that it would please +God to crush me , that he would let loose his hand and cut me off !
DARBY	Job	6	10	Then should I yet have comfort ; and in the pain which spareth not I would rejoice that I have not denied the words of the Holy One .
DARBY	Job	6	11	What is my strength , that I should hope ? and what is mine end , that I should have patience ?
DARBY	Job	6	12	Is my strength the strength of stones ? is my flesh of brass ?
DARBY	Job	6	13	Is it not that there is no help in me , and soundness is driven away from me ?
DARBY	Job	6	14	For him that is fainting kindness [ is meet ] from his friend ; or he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty .
DARBY	Job	6	15	My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a stream , as the channel of streams which pass away ,
DARBY	Job	6	16	Which are turbid by reason of the ice , in which the snow hideth itself :
DARBY	Job	6	17	At the time they diminish , they are dried up ; when heat affecteth them , they vanish from their place :
DARBY	Job	6	18	They wind about in the paths of their course , they go off into the waste and perish .
DARBY	Job	6	19	The caravans of Tema looked , the companies of Sheba counted on them :
DARBY	Job	6	20	They are ashamed at their hope ; they come thither , and are confounded .
DARBY	Job	6	21	So now ye are nothing ; ye see a terrible object and are afraid .
DARBY	Job	6	22	Did I say , Bring unto me , and make me a present from your substance ?
DARBY	Job	6	23	Or , rescue me from the hand of the oppressor , and redeem me from the hand of the violent ?
DARBY	Job	6	24	Teach me , and I will hold my tongue ; and cause me to understand wherein I have erred .
DARBY	Job	6	25	How forcible are right words ! but what doth your upbraiding reprove ?
DARBY	Job	6	26	Do ye imagine to reprove words ? The speeches of one that is desperate are indeed for the wind .
DARBY	Job	6	27	Yea , ye overwhelm the fatherless , and dig [ a pit ] for your friend .
DARBY	Job	6	28	Now therefore if ye will , look upon me ; and it shall be to your face if I lie .
DARBY	Job	6	29	Return , I pray you , let there be no wrong ; yea , return again , my righteousness shall be in it .
DARBY	Job	6	30	Is there wrong in my tongue ? can not my taste discern mischievous things ?
DARBY	Job	7	7	Remember thou that my life is wind ; mine eye shall no more see good .
DARBY	Job	7	2	As a bondman earnestly desireth the shadow , and a hireling expecteth his wages ,
DARBY	Job	7	3	So am I made to possess months of vanity , and wearisome nights are appointed to me .
DARBY	Job	7	4	If I lie down , I say , When shall I rise up , and the darkness be gone ? and I am full of tossings until the dawn .
DARBY	Job	7	5	My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust ; my skin is broken , and suppurates .
DARBY	Job	7	6	My days are swifter than a weaver 's shuttle , and are spent without hope .
DARBY	Job	7	8	The eye of him that hath seen me shall behold me no [ more ] : thine eyes are upon me , and I am not .
DARBY	Job	7	9	The cloud consumeth and vanisheth away ; so he that goeth down to Sheol shall not come up .
DARBY	Job	7	10	He shall return no more to his house , neither shall his place know him again .
DARBY	Job	7	11	Therefore I will not restrain my mouth : I will speak in the anguish of my spirit ; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
DARBY	Job	7	12	Am I a sea , or a sea-monster , that thou settest a watch over me ?
DARBY	Job	7	13	When I say , My bed shall comfort me , my couch shall ease my complaint ;
DARBY	Job	7	14	Then thou scarest me with dreams , and terrifiest me through visions ;
DARBY	Job	7	15	So that my soul chooseth strangling , death , rather than my bones .
DARBY	Job	7	16	I loathe it ; I shall not live always : let me alone , for my days are a breath .
DARBY	Job	7	17	What is man , that thou makest much of him ? and that thou settest thy heart upon him ?
DARBY	Job	7	18	And that thou visitest him every morning , triest him every moment ?
DARBY	Job	7	19	How long wilt thou not look away from me , nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle ?
DARBY	Job	7	20	Have I sinned , what do I unto thee , thou Observer of men ? Why hast thou set me as an object of assault for thee , so that I am become a burden to myself ?
DARBY	Job	7	21	And why dost not thou forgive my transgression and take away mine iniquity ? for now shall I lie down in the dust , and thou shalt seek me early , and I shall not be .
DARBY	Job	8	8	For inquire , I pray thee , of the former generation , and attend to the researches of their fathers ;
DARBY	Job	8	2	How long wilt thou speak these things ? and the words of thy mouth be a strong wind ?
DARBY	Job	8	3	Doth God pervert judgment , and the Almighty pervert justice ?
DARBY	Job	8	4	If thy children have sinned against him , he hath also given them over into the hand of their transgression .
DARBY	Job	8	5	If thou seek earnestly unto God , and make thy supplication to the Almighty ,
DARBY	Job	8	6	If thou be pure and upright , surely now he will awake for thee , and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous ;
DARBY	Job	8	7	And though thy beginning was small , yet thine end shall be very great .
DARBY	Job	8	9	For we are [ but ] of yesterday , and know nothing , for our days upon earth are a shadow .
DARBY	Job	8	10	Shall not they teach thee , [ and ] tell thee , and utter words out of their heart ?
DARBY	Job	8	11	Doth the papyrus shoot up without mire ? doth the reed-grass grow without water ?
DARBY	Job	8	12	Whilst it is yet in its greenness [ and ] not cut down , it withereth before any [ other ] grass .
DARBY	Job	8	13	So are the paths of all that forget God ; and the profane man 's hope shall perish ,
DARBY	Job	8	14	Whose confidence shall be cut off , and his reliance is a spider 's web .
DARBY	Job	8	15	He shall lean upon his house , and it shall not stand ; he shall lay hold on it , but it shall not endure .
DARBY	Job	8	16	He is full of sap before the sun , and his sprout shooteth forth over his garden ;
DARBY	Job	8	17	His roots are entwined about the stoneheap ; he seeth the place of stones .
DARBY	Job	8	18	If he destroy him from his place , then it shall deny him : I have not seen thee !
DARBY	Job	8	19	Behold , this is the joy of his way , and out of the dust shall others grow .
DARBY	Job	8	20	Behold , God will not cast off a perfect man , neither will he take evil-doers by the hand .
DARBY	Job	8	21	Whilst he would fill thy mouth with laughing and thy lips with shouting ,
DARBY	Job	8	22	They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame , and the tent of the wicked be no more .
DARBY	Job	9	9	Who maketh the Bear , Orion , and the Pleiades , and the chambers of the south ;
DARBY	Job	9	2	Of a truth I know it is so ; but how can man be just with God ?
DARBY	Job	9	3	If he shall choose to strive with him , he can not answer him one thing of a thousand .
DARBY	Job	9	4	He is wise in heart and mighty in strength : who hath hardened himself against him , and had peace ?
DARBY	Job	9	5	Who removeth mountains , and they know it not , when he overturneth them in his anger ;
DARBY	Job	9	6	Who shaketh the earth out of its place , and the pillars thereof tremble ;
DARBY	Job	9	7	Who commandeth the sun , and it riseth not , and he sealeth up the stars ;
DARBY	Job	9	8	Who alone spreadeth out the heavens , and treadeth upon the high waves of the sea ;
DARBY	Job	9	10	Who doeth great things past finding out , and wonders without number .
DARBY	Job	9	11	Lo , he goeth by me , and I see [ him ] not ; and he passeth along , and I perceive him not .
DARBY	Job	9	12	Behold , he taketh away : who will hinder him ? Who will say unto him , What doest thou ?
DARBY	Job	9	13	+God withdraweth not his anger ; the proud helpers stoop under him :
DARBY	Job	9	14	How much less shall I answer him , choose out my words [ to strive ] with him ?
DARBY	Job	9	15	Whom , though I were righteous , [ yet ] would I not answer ; I would make supplication to my judge .
DARBY	Job	9	16	If I had called , and he had answered me , I would not believe that he hearkened to my voice , —
DARBY	Job	9	17	He , who crusheth me with a tempest , and multiplieth my wounds without cause .
DARBY	Job	9	18	He suffereth me not to take my breath , for he filleth me with bitternesses .
DARBY	Job	9	19	Be it a question of strength , lo , [ he is ] strong ; and be it of judgment , who will set me a time ?
DARBY	Job	9	20	If I justified myself , mine own mouth would condemn me ; were I perfect , he would prove me perverse .
DARBY	Job	9	21	Were I perfect , [ yet ] would I not know my soul : I would despise my life .
DARBY	Job	9	22	It is all one ; therefore I said , he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked .
DARBY	Job	9	23	If the scourge kill suddenly , he mocketh at the trial of the innocent .
DARBY	Job	9	24	The earth is given over into the hand of the wicked [ man ] ; he covereth the faces of its judges . If not , who then is it ?
DARBY	Job	9	25	And my days are swifter than a runner : they flee away , they see no good .
DARBY	Job	9	26	They pass by like skiffs of reed ; as an eagle that swoops upon the prey .
DARBY	Job	9	27	If I say , I will forget my complaint , I will leave off my [ sad ] countenance , and brighten up ,
DARBY	Job	9	28	I am afraid of all my sorrows ; I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent .
DARBY	Job	9	29	Be it that I am wicked , why then do I labour in vain ?
DARBY	Job	9	30	If I washed myself with snow-water , and cleansed my hands in purity ,
DARBY	Job	9	31	Then wouldest thou plunge me in the ditch , and mine own clothes would abhor me .
DARBY	Job	9	32	For he is not a man , as I am , that I should answer him ; that we should come together in judgment .
DARBY	Job	9	33	There is not an umpire between us , who should lay his hand upon us both .
DARBY	Job	9	34	Let him take his rod away from me , and let not his terror make me afraid ,
DARBY	Job	9	35	[ Then ] I will speak , and not fear him ; but it is not so with me .
DARBY	Job	10	10	Hast thou not poured me out as milk , and curdled me like cheese ?
DARBY	Job	10	2	I will say unto +God , Do not condemn me ; shew me wherefore thou strivest with me .
DARBY	Job	10	3	Doth it please thee to oppress , that thou shouldest despise the work of thy hands , and shine upon the counsel of the wicked ?
DARBY	Job	10	4	Hast thou eyes of flesh ? or seest thou as man seeth ?
DARBY	Job	10	5	Are thy days as the days of a mortal ? are thy years as a man 's days ,
DARBY	Job	10	6	That thou searchest after mine iniquity , and inquirest into my sin ;
DARBY	Job	10	7	Since thou knowest that I am not wicked , and that there is none that delivereth out of thy hand ?
DARBY	Job	10	8	Thy hands have bound me together and made me as one , round about ; yet dost thou swallow me up !
DARBY	Job	10	9	Remember , I beseech thee , that thou hast made me as clay , and wilt bring me into dust again .
DARBY	Job	10	11	Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh , and knit me together with bones and sinews ;
DARBY	Job	10	12	Thou hast granted me life and favour , and thy care hath preserved my spirit ;
DARBY	Job	10	13	And these things didst thou hide in thy heart ; I know that this was with thee .
DARBY	Job	10	14	If I sinned , thou wouldest mark me , and thou wouldest not acquit me of mine iniquity .
DARBY	Job	10	15	If I were wicked , woe unto me ! and righteous , I will not lift up my head , being [ so ] full of shame , and beholding mine affliction ; —
DARBY	Job	10	16	And it increaseth : thou huntest me as a fierce lion ; and ever again thou shewest thy marvellous power upon me .
DARBY	Job	10	17	Thou renewest thy witnesses before me and increasest thy displeasure against me ; successions [ of evil ] and a time of toil are with me .
DARBY	Job	10	18	And wherefore didst thou bring me forth out of the womb ? I had expired , and no eye had seen me .
DARBY	Job	10	19	I should be as though I had not been ; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave .
DARBY	Job	10	20	Are not my days few ? cease then and let me alone , that I may revive a little ,
DARBY	Job	10	21	Before I go , and never to return , —to the land of darkness and the shadow of death ;
DARBY	Job	10	22	A land of gloom , as darkness itself ; of the shadow of death , without any order , where the light is as thick darkness .
DARBY	Job	11	11	For he knoweth vain men , and seeth wickedness when [ man ] doth not consider it ;
DARBY	Job	11	2	Should not the multitude of words be answered ? and should a man of much talk be justified ?
DARBY	Job	11	3	Should thy fictions make men hold their peace ? and shouldest thou mock , and no one make [ thee ] ashamed ?
DARBY	Job	11	4	For thou sayest , My doctrine is pure , and I am clean in thine eyes .
DARBY	Job	11	5	But oh that +God would speak , and open his lips against thee ;
DARBY	Job	11	6	And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom , how that they are the double of what is realised ; and know that +God passeth by [ much ] of thine iniquity !
DARBY	Job	11	7	Canst thou by searching find out +God ? canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection ?
DARBY	Job	11	8	[ It is as ] the heights of heaven ; what wilt thou do ? deeper than Sheol ; what canst thou know ?
DARBY	Job	11	9	The measure thereof is longer than the earth , and broader than the sea .
DARBY	Job	11	10	If he pass by , and shut up , and call to judgment , who can hinder him ?
DARBY	Job	11	12	Yet a senseless man will make bold , though man be born [ like ] the foal of a wild ass .
DARBY	Job	11	13	If thou prepare thy heart and stretch out thy hands toward him ,
DARBY	Job	11	14	If thou put far away the iniquity which is in thy hand , and let not wrong dwell in thy tents ;
DARBY	Job	11	15	Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot , and thou shalt be stedfast and shalt not fear :
DARBY	Job	11	16	For thou shalt forget misery ; as waters that are passed away shalt thou remember it ;
DARBY	Job	11	17	And life shall arise brighter than noonday ; though thou be enshrouded in darkness , thou shalt be as the morning ,
DARBY	Job	11	18	And thou shalt have confidence , because there shall be hope ; and having searched about [ thee ] , thou shalt take rest in safety .
DARBY	Job	11	19	Yea , thou shalt lie down , and none shall make thee afraid ; and many shall seek thy favour .
DARBY	Job	11	20	But the eyes of the wicked shall fail , and [ all ] refuge shall vanish from them , and their hope [ shall be ] the breathing out of life .
DARBY	Job	12	12	With the aged is wisdom , and in length of days understanding .
DARBY	Job	12	2	Truly ye are the people , and wisdom shall die with you !
DARBY	Job	12	3	I also have understanding as well as you ; I am not inferior to you ; and who knoweth not such things as these ?
DARBY	Job	12	4	I am to be one that is a derision to his friend , I who call upon +God , and whom he will answer : a derision is the just upright [ man ] .
DARBY	Job	12	5	He that is ready to stumble with the foot is a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease .
DARBY	Job	12	6	The tents of desolators are in peace , and they that provoke God are secure ; into whose hand +God bringeth .
DARBY	Job	12	7	But ask now the beasts , and they shall teach thee ; and the fowl of the heavens , and they shall tell thee ;
DARBY	Job	12	8	Or speak to the earth , and it shall teach thee ; and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee .
DARBY	Job	12	9	Who knoweth not in all these , that the hand of Jehovah hath wrought this ?
DARBY	Job	12	10	In whose hand is the soul of every living thing , and the spirit of all flesh of man .
DARBY	Job	12	11	Doth not the ear try words , as the palate tasteth food ?
DARBY	Job	12	13	With him is wisdom and might ; he hath counsel and understanding .
DARBY	Job	12	14	Behold , he breaketh down , and it is not built again ; he shutteth up a man , and there is no opening .
DARBY	Job	12	15	Behold , he withholdeth the waters , and they dry up ; and he sendeth them out , and they overturn the earth .
DARBY	Job	12	16	With him is strength and effectual knowledge ; the deceived and the deceiver are his .
DARBY	Job	12	17	He leadeth counsellors away spoiled , and judges maketh he fools ;
DARBY	Job	12	18	He weakeneth the government of kings , and bindeth their loins with a fetter ;
DARBY	Job	12	19	He leadeth priests away spoiled , and overthroweth the mighty ;
DARBY	Job	12	20	He depriveth of speech the trusty , and taketh away the judgment of the elders ;
DARBY	Job	12	21	He poureth contempt upon nobles , and slackeneth the girdle of the mighty ;
DARBY	Job	12	22	He discovereth deep things out of darkness , and bringeth out into light the shadow of death ;
DARBY	Job	12	23	He increaseth the nations , and destroyeth them ; he spreadeth out the nations , and bringeth them in ;
DARBY	Job	12	24	He taketh away the understanding of the chiefs of the people of the earth , and causeth them to wander in a pathless waste .
DARBY	Job	12	25	They grope in the dark without light , and he maketh them to stagger like a drunkard .
DARBY	Job	13	13	Hold your peace from me , and I will speak , and let come on me what [ will ] !
DARBY	Job	13	2	What ye know , I know also : I am not inferior to you .
DARBY	Job	13	3	But I will speak to the Almighty , and will find pleasure in reasoning with God ;
DARBY	Job	13	4	For ye indeed are forgers of lies , ye are all physicians of no value .
DARBY	Job	13	5	Oh that ye would be altogether silent ! and it would be your wisdom .
DARBY	Job	13	6	Hear now my defence , and hearken to the pleadings of my lips .
DARBY	Job	13	7	Will ye speak unrighteously for God ? and for him speak deceit ?
DARBY	Job	13	8	Will ye accept his person ? will ye contend for God ?
DARBY	Job	13	9	Will it be well if he should search you out ? or as one mocketh at a man , will ye mock at him ?
DARBY	Job	13	10	He will certainly reprove you , if ye do secretly accept persons .
DARBY	Job	13	11	Shall not his excellency terrify you ? and his dread fall upon you ?
DARBY	Job	13	12	Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes , your bulwarks are bulwarks of mire .
DARBY	Job	13	14	Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth , and put my life in my hand ?
DARBY	Job	13	15	Behold , if he slay me , yet would I trust in him ; but I will defend mine own ways before him .
DARBY	Job	13	16	This also shall be my salvation , that a profane man shall not come before his face .
DARBY	Job	13	17	Hear attentively my speech and my declaration with your ears .
DARBY	Job	13	18	Behold now , I have ordered the cause ; I know that I shall be justified .
DARBY	Job	13	19	Who is he that contendeth with me ? For if I were silent now , I should expire .
DARBY	Job	13	20	Only do not two things unto me ; then will I not hide myself from thee .
DARBY	Job	13	21	Withdraw thy hand far from me ; and let not thy terror make me afraid :
DARBY	Job	13	22	Then call , and I will answer ; or I will speak , and answer thou me .
DARBY	Job	13	23	How many are mine iniquities and sins ? Make me to know my transgression and my sin .
DARBY	Job	13	24	Wherefore dost thou hide thy face , and countest me for thine enemy ?
DARBY	Job	13	25	Wilt thou terrify a driven leaf ? and wilt thou pursue dry stubble ?
DARBY	Job	13	26	For thou writest bitter things against me , and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth ;
DARBY	Job	13	27	And thou puttest my feet in the stocks , and markest all my paths ; thou settest a bound about the soles of my feet ; —
DARBY	Job	13	28	One who , as a rotten thing consumeth , as a garment that the moth eateth .
DARBY	Job	14	14	( If a man die , shall he live [ again ] ? ) all the days of my time of toil would I wait , till my change should come :
DARBY	Job	14	2	He cometh forth like a flower , and is cut down ; and he fleeth as a shadow , and continueth not .
DARBY	Job	14	3	Yet dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one , and bringest me into judgment with thee ?
DARBY	Job	14	4	Who can bring a clean [ man ] out of the unclean ? Not one !
DARBY	Job	14	5	If his days are determined , if the number of his months is with thee , [ and ] thou hast appointed his bounds which he must not pass ,
DARBY	Job	14	6	Look away from him ; and let him rest , till he accomplish , as a hireling , his day .
DARBY	Job	14	7	For there is hope for a tree : if it be cut down , it will sprout again , and its tender branch will not cease ;
DARBY	Job	14	8	Though its root grow old in the earth , and its stock die in the ground ,
DARBY	Job	14	9	Yet through the scent of water it will bud , and put forth boughs like a young plant .
DARBY	Job	14	10	But a man dieth , and is prostrate ; yea , man expireth , and where is he ?
DARBY	Job	14	11	The waters recede from the lake , and the river wasteth and drieth up :
DARBY	Job	14	12	So man lieth down , and riseth not again ; till the heavens be no more , they do not awake , nor are raised out of their sleep .
DARBY	Job	14	13	Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol , that thou wouldest keep me secret until thine anger be past , that thou wouldest appoint me a set time , and remember me , —
DARBY	Job	14	15	Thou wouldest call , and I would answer thee ; thou wouldest have a desire after the work of thy hands .
DARBY	Job	14	16	For now thou numberest my steps : dost thou not watch over my sin ?
DARBY	Job	14	17	My transgression is sealed up in a bag , and thou heapest up mine iniquity .
DARBY	Job	14	18	And indeed a mountain falling cometh to nought , and the rock is removed out of its place ;
DARBY	Job	14	19	The waters wear the stones , the floods thereof wash away the dust of the earth ; and thou destroyest the hope of man .
DARBY	Job	14	20	Thou prevailest for ever against him , and he passeth away ; thou changest his countenance , and dismissest him .
DARBY	Job	14	21	His sons come to honour , and he knoweth it not ; and they are brought low , and he perceiveth it not .
DARBY	Job	14	22	But his flesh hath pain for himself alone , and his soul mourneth for himself .
DARBY	Job	15	15	Behold , he putteth no trust in his holy ones , and the heavens are not pure in his sight :
DARBY	Job	15	2	Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge , and fill his belly with the east wind ,
DARBY	Job	15	3	Reasoning with unprofitable talk , and with speeches which do no good ?
DARBY	Job	15	4	Yea , thou makest piety of none effect , and restrainest meditation before God .
DARBY	Job	15	5	For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity , and thou hast chosen the tongue of the crafty .
DARBY	Job	15	6	Thine own mouth condemneth thee , and not I ; and thy lips testify against thee .
DARBY	Job	15	7	Art thou the first man that was born ? and wast thou brought forth before the hills ?
DARBY	Job	15	8	Hast thou listened in the secret council of +God ? And hast thou absorbed wisdom for thyself ?
DARBY	Job	15	9	What knowest thou that we know not ? [ what ] understandest thou which is not in us ?
DARBY	Job	15	10	Both the greyheaded and the aged are with us , older than thy father .
DARBY	Job	15	11	Are the consolations of God too small for thee ? and the word gently spoken to thee ?
DARBY	Job	15	12	Why doth thy heart carry thee away ? and why do thine eyes wink ?
DARBY	Job	15	13	That thou turnest thy spirit against God , and lettest words go out of thy mouth ?
DARBY	Job	15	14	What is man , that he should be pure ? and he that is born of a woman , that he should be righteous ?
DARBY	Job	15	16	How much less the abominable and corrupt , —man , that drinketh unrighteousness like water !
DARBY	Job	15	17	I will shew thee , listen to me ; and what I have seen I will declare ;
DARBY	Job	15	18	Which wise men have told from their fathers , and have not hidden ;
DARBY	Job	15	19	Unto whom alone the earth was given , and no stranger passed among them .
DARBY	Job	15	20	All his days the wicked man is tormented , and numbered years are allotted to the violent .
DARBY	Job	15	21	The sound of terrors is in his ears : in prosperity the destroyer cometh upon him .
DARBY	Job	15	22	He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness , and he is singled out for the sword .
DARBY	Job	15	23	He wandereth abroad for bread , —where may it be ? He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand .
DARBY	Job	15	24	Distress and anguish make him afraid ; they prevail against him , as a king ready for the battle .
DARBY	Job	15	25	For he hath stretched out his hand against God , and strengthened himself against the Almighty :
DARBY	Job	15	26	He runneth against him , with [ outstretched ] neck , with the thick bosses of his bucklers ;
DARBY	Job	15	27	For he hath covered his face with his fatness , and gathered fat upon [ his ] flanks .
DARBY	Job	15	28	And he dwelleth in desolate cities , in houses that no man inhabiteth , which are destined to become heaps .
DARBY	Job	15	29	He shall not become rich , neither shall his substance continue , and their possessions shall not extend upon the earth .
DARBY	Job	15	30	He shall not depart out of darkness ; the flame shall dry up his branches ; and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away .
DARBY	Job	15	31	Let him not trust in vanity : he is deceived , for vanity shall be his recompense ;
DARBY	Job	15	32	It shall be complete before his day , and his branch shall not be green .
DARBY	Job	15	33	He shall shake off his unripe grapes as a vine , and shall cast his flower as an olive .
DARBY	Job	15	34	For the family of the ungodly shall be barren , and fire shall consume the tents of bribery .
DARBY	Job	15	35	They conceive mischief , and bring forth iniquity , and their belly prepareth deceit .
DARBY	Job	16	16	My face is red with weeping , and on my eyelids is the shadow of death ;
DARBY	Job	16	2	I have heard many such things : grievous comforters are ye all .
DARBY	Job	16	3	Shall words of wind have an end ? or what provoketh thee that thou answerest ?
DARBY	Job	16	4	I also could speak as ye : if your soul were in my soul 's stead , I could join together words against you , and shake my head at you ;
DARBY	Job	16	5	[ But ] I would encourage you with my mouth , and the solace of my lips should assuage [ your pain ] .
DARBY	Job	16	6	If I speak , my pain is not assuaged ; and if I forbear , what am I eased ?
DARBY	Job	16	7	But now he hath made me weary ; … thou hast made desolate all my family ;
DARBY	Job	16	8	Thou hast shrivelled me up ! it is become a witness ; and my leanness riseth up against me , it beareth witness to my face .
DARBY	Job	16	9	His anger teareth and pursueth me ; he gnasheth with his teeth against me ; [ as ] mine adversary he sharpeneth his eyes at me .
DARBY	Job	16	10	They gape upon me with their mouth ; they smite my cheeks reproachfully ; they range themselves together against me .
DARBY	Job	16	11	God hath delivered me over to the iniquitous man , and hurled me into the hands of the wicked .
DARBY	Job	16	12	I was at rest , but he hath shattered me ; he hath taken me by the neck and shaken me to pieces , and set me up for his mark .
DARBY	Job	16	13	His arrows encompass me round about , he cleaveth my reins asunder and doth not spare ; he poureth out my gall upon the ground .
DARBY	Job	16	14	He breaketh me with breach upon breach ; he runneth upon me like a mighty man .
DARBY	Job	16	15	I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin , and rolled my horn in the dust .
DARBY	Job	16	17	Although there is no violence in my hands , and my prayer is pure .
DARBY	Job	16	18	O earth , cover not my blood , and let there be no place for my cry !
DARBY	Job	16	19	Even now , behold , my Witness is in the heavens , and he that voucheth for me is in the heights .
DARBY	Job	16	20	My friends are my mockers ; mine eye poureth out tears unto +God .
DARBY	Job	16	21	Oh that there were arbitration for a man with +God , as a son of man for his friend !
DARBY	Job	16	22	For years [ few ] in number shall pass , —and I shall go the way [ whence ] I shall not return .
DARBY	Job	17	17	My breath is corrupt , my days are extinct , the graves are mine .
DARBY	Job	17	2	Are there not mockers around me ? and doth [ not ] mine eye abide in their provocation ?
DARBY	Job	17	3	Lay down now [ a pledge ] , be thou surety for me with thyself : who is he that striketh hands with me ?
DARBY	Job	17	4	For thou hast hidden their heart from understanding ; therefore thou wilt not exalt [ them ] .
DARBY	Job	17	5	He that betrayeth friends for a prey—even the eyes of his children shall fail .
DARBY	Job	17	6	And he hath made me a proverb of the peoples ; and I am become one to be spit on in the face .
DARBY	Job	17	7	And mine eye is dim by reason of grief , and all my members are as a shadow .
DARBY	Job	17	8	Upright men [ shall be ] astonished at this , and the innocent shall be stirred up against the ungodly ;
DARBY	Job	17	9	But the righteous shall hold on his way , and he that hath clean hands shall increase in strength .
DARBY	Job	17	10	But as for you all , pray come on again ; and I shall not find one wise man among you .
DARBY	Job	17	11	My days are past , my purposes are broken off , the cherished thoughts of my heart .
DARBY	Job	17	12	They change the night into day ; the light [ they imagine ] near in presence of the darkness .
DARBY	Job	17	13	If I wait , Sheol is my house ; I spread my bed in the darkness :
DARBY	Job	17	14	I cry to the grave , Thou art my father ! to the worm , My mother , and my sister !
DARBY	Job	17	15	And where is then my hope ? yea , my hope , who shall see it ?
DARBY	Job	17	16	It shall go down to the bars of Sheol , when [ our ] rest shall be together in the dust .
DARBY	Job	18	18	He is driven from light into darkness , and chased out of the world .
DARBY	Job	18	2	How long will ye hunt for words ? Be intelligent , and then we will speak .
DARBY	Job	18	3	Wherefore are we counted as beasts , and reputed stupid in your sight ?
DARBY	Job	18	4	Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger , shall the earth be forsaken for thee ? and shall the rock be removed out of its place ?
DARBY	Job	18	5	Yea , the light of the wicked shall be put out , and the flame of his fire shall not shine .
DARBY	Job	18	6	The light shall become dark in his tent , and his lamp over him shall be put out .
DARBY	Job	18	7	The steps of his strength shall be straitened , and his own counsel shall cast him down .
DARBY	Job	18	8	For he is sent into the net by his own feet , and he walketh on the meshes ;
DARBY	Job	18	9	The gin taketh [ him ] by the heel , the snare layeth hold on him ;
DARBY	Job	18	10	A cord is hidden for him in the ground , and his trap in the way .
DARBY	Job	18	11	Terrors make him afraid on every side , and chase him at his footsteps .
DARBY	Job	18	12	His strength is hunger-bitten , and calamity is ready at his side .
DARBY	Job	18	13	The firstborn of death devoureth the members of his body ; it will devour his members .
DARBY	Job	18	14	His confidence shall be rooted out of his tent , and it shall lead him away to the king of terrors :
DARBY	Job	18	15	They who are none of his shall dwell in his tent ; brimstone shall be showered upon his habitation :
DARBY	Job	18	16	His roots shall be dried up beneath , and above shall his branch be cut off ;
DARBY	Job	18	17	His remembrance shall perish from the earth , and he shall have no name on the pasture-grounds .
DARBY	Job	18	19	He hath neither son nor grandson among his people , nor any remaining in the places of his sojourn .
DARBY	Job	18	20	They that come after shall be astonished at his day , as they that went before [ them ] were affrighted .
DARBY	Job	18	21	Surely , such are the dwellings of the unrighteous man , and such the place of him that knoweth not God .
DARBY	Job	19	19	All my intimate friends abhor me , and they whom I loved are turned against me .
DARBY	Job	19	2	How long will ye vex my soul , and crush me with words ?
DARBY	Job	19	3	These ten times have ye reproached me ; ye are not ashamed to stupefy me .
DARBY	Job	19	4	And be it [ that ] I have erred , mine error remaineth with myself .
DARBY	Job	19	5	If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me , and prove against me my reproach ,
DARBY	Job	19	6	Know now that +God hath overthrown me , and hath surrounded me with his net .
DARBY	Job	19	7	Behold , I cry out of wrong , and I am not heard ; I cry aloud , but there is no judgment .
DARBY	Job	19	8	He hath hedged up my way that I can not pass , and he hath set darkness in my paths .
DARBY	Job	19	9	He hath stripped me of my glory , and taken the crown from my head .
DARBY	Job	19	10	He breaketh me down on every side , and I am gone ; and my hope hath he torn up as a tree .
DARBY	Job	19	11	And he hath kindled his anger against me , and hath counted me unto him as one of his enemies .
DARBY	Job	19	12	His troops have come together and cast up their way against me , and have encamped round about my tent .
DARBY	Job	19	13	He hath put my brethren far from me , and mine acquaintance are quite estranged from me .
DARBY	Job	19	14	My kinsfolk have failed , and my known friends have forgotten me .
DARBY	Job	19	15	The sojourners in my house and my maids count me as a stranger ; I am an alien in their sight .
DARBY	Job	19	16	I called my servant , and he answered not ; I entreated him with my mouth .
DARBY	Job	19	17	My breath is strange to my wife , and my entreaties to the children of my [ mother 's ] womb .
DARBY	Job	19	18	Even young children despise me ; I rise up , and they speak against me .
DARBY	Job	19	20	My bones cleave to my skin and to my flesh , and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth .
DARBY	Job	19	21	Have pity upon me , have pity upon me , ye my friends ; for the hand of +God hath touched me .
DARBY	Job	19	22	Why do ye persecute me as God , and are not satisfied with my flesh ?
DARBY	Job	19	23	Oh would that my words were written ! oh that they were inscribed in a book !
DARBY	Job	19	24	That with an iron style and lead they were graven in the rock for ever !
DARBY	Job	19	25	And [ as for ] me , I know that my Redeemer liveth , and the Last , he shall stand upon the earth ;
DARBY	Job	19	26	And [ if ] after my skin this shall be destroyed , yet from out of my flesh shall I see +God ;
DARBY	Job	19	27	Whom I shall see for myself , and mine eyes shall behold , and not another : —my reins are consumed within me .
DARBY	Job	19	28	If ye say , How shall we persecute him ? when the root of the matter is found in me ,
DARBY	Job	19	29	Be ye yourselves afraid of the sword ! for the sword is fury against misdeeds , that ye may know there is a judgment .
DARBY	Job	20	20	Because he knew no rest in his craving , he shall save nought of what he most desired .
DARBY	Job	20	2	Therefore do my thoughts give me an answer , and for this is my haste within me .
DARBY	Job	20	3	I hear a reproof putting me to shame ; and [ my ] spirit answereth me by mine understanding .
DARBY	Job	20	4	Knowest thou [ not ] this , that of old , since man was placed upon earth ,
DARBY	Job	20	5	The exultation of the wicked is short , and the joy of the ungodly man but for a moment ?
DARBY	Job	20	6	Though his height mount up to the heavens , and his head reach unto the clouds ,
DARBY	Job	20	7	Like his own dung doth he perish for ever ; they which have seen him shall say , Where is he ?
DARBY	Job	20	8	He flieth away as a dream , and is not found ; and is chased away as a vision of the night .
DARBY	Job	20	9	The eye which saw him shall [ see him ] not again ; and his place beholdeth him no more .
DARBY	Job	20	10	His children shall seek the favour of the poor , and his hands restore his wealth .
DARBY	Job	20	11	His bones were full of his youthful strength ; but it shall lie down with him in the dust .
DARBY	Job	20	12	Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth [ and ] he hide it under his tongue ,
DARBY	Job	20	13	[ Though ] he spare it , and forsake it not , but keep it within his mouth ,
DARBY	Job	20	14	His food is turned in his bowels ; it is the gall of asps within him .
DARBY	Job	20	15	He hath swallowed down riches , but he shall vomit them up again : God shall cast them out of his belly .
DARBY	Job	20	16	He shall suck the poison of asps ; the viper 's tongue shall kill him .
DARBY	Job	20	17	He shall not see streams , rivers , brooks of honey and butter .
DARBY	Job	20	18	That which he laboured for shall he restore , and not swallow down ; its restitution shall be according to the value , and he shall not rejoice [ therein ] .
DARBY	Job	20	19	For he hath oppressed , hath forsaken the poor ; he hath violently taken away a house that he did not build .
DARBY	Job	20	21	Nothing escaped his greediness ; therefore his prosperity shall not endure .
DARBY	Job	20	22	In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits ; every hand of the wretched shall come upon him .
DARBY	Job	20	23	It shall be that , to fill his belly , he will cast his fierce anger upon him , and will rain it upon him into his flesh .
DARBY	Job	20	24	If he have fled from the iron weapon , the bow of brass shall strike him through .
DARBY	Job	20	25	He draweth it forth ; it cometh out of his body , and the glittering point out of his gall : terrors are upon him .
DARBY	Job	20	26	All darkness is laid up for his treasures : a fire not blown shall devour him ; it shall feed upon what is left in his tent .
DARBY	Job	20	27	The heavens shall reveal his iniquity , and the earth shall rise up against him .
DARBY	Job	20	28	The increase of his house shall depart , flowing away in the day of his anger .
DARBY	Job	20	29	This is the portion of the wicked man from God , and the heritage appointed to him by God .
DARBY	Job	21	21	For what pleasure should he have in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off ?
DARBY	Job	21	2	Hear attentively my speech , and let this replace your consolations .
DARBY	Job	21	3	Suffer me and I will speak ; and after I have spoken , mock on !
DARBY	Job	21	4	As for me , is my complaint to a man ? or wherefore should not my spirit be impatient ?
DARBY	Job	21	5	Mark me , and be astonished , and lay the hand upon the mouth .
DARBY	Job	21	6	Even when I think [ thereon ] , I am affrighted , and trembling taketh hold of my flesh .
DARBY	Job	21	7	Wherefore do the wicked live , grow old , yea , become mighty in power ?
DARBY	Job	21	8	Their seed is established with them in their sight , and their offspring before their eyes .
DARBY	Job	21	9	Their houses are safe from fear , neither is the rod of +God upon them .
DARBY	Job	21	10	Their bull gendereth , and faileth not ; their cow calveth , and casteth not her calf .
DARBY	Job	21	11	They send forth their little ones like a flock , and their children dance .
DARBY	Job	21	12	They shout to the tambour and harp , and rejoice at the sound of the pipe .
DARBY	Job	21	13	They spend their days in prosperity , and in a moment go down to Sheol .
DARBY	Job	21	14	And they say unto God , Depart from us , for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways !
DARBY	Job	21	15	What is the Almighty that we should serve him ? and what are we profited if we pray unto him ?
DARBY	Job	21	16	Behold , their prosperity is not in their hand . The counsel of the wicked be far from me !
DARBY	Job	21	17	How often is the lamp of the wicked put out , and cometh their calamity upon them ? Doth he distribute sorrows [ to them ] in his anger ?
DARBY	Job	21	18	Do they become as stubble before the wind , and as chaff that the storm carrieth away ?
DARBY	Job	21	19	+God layeth up [ the punishment of ] his iniquity for his children ; he rewardeth him , and he shall know [ it ] :
DARBY	Job	21	20	His eyes shall see his destruction , and he shall drink of the fury of the Almighty .
DARBY	Job	21	22	Can any teach God knowledge ? And he it is that judgeth those that are high .
DARBY	Job	21	23	One dieth in his full strength , being wholly at ease and quiet ;
DARBY	Job	21	24	His sides are full of fat , and the marrow of his bones is moistened ;
DARBY	Job	21	25	And another dieth in bitterness of soul , and hath not tasted good :
DARBY	Job	21	26	Together they lie down in the dust , and the worms cover them .
DARBY	Job	21	27	Lo , I know your thoughts , and the devices ye wrongfully imagine against me .
DARBY	Job	21	28	For ye say , Where is the house of the noble ? and where the tent of the dwellings of the wicked ?
DARBY	Job	21	29	Have ye not asked the wayfarers ? and do ye not regard their tokens :
DARBY	Job	21	30	That the wicked is reserved for the day of calamity ? They are led forth to the day of wrath .
DARBY	Job	21	31	Who shall declare his way to his face ? and who shall repay him what he hath done ?
DARBY	Job	21	32	Yet is he carried to the graves , and watch is kept over the tomb .
DARBY	Job	21	33	The clods of the valley are sweet unto him ; and every man followeth suit after him , as there were innumerable before him .
DARBY	Job	21	34	How then comfort ye me in vain ? Your answers remain perfidious .
DARBY	Job	22	22	Receive , I pray thee , instruction from his mouth , and lay up his words in thy heart .
DARBY	Job	22	2	Can a man be profitable to God ? surely it is unto himself that the wise man is profitable .
DARBY	Job	22	3	Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if thou art righteous ? And is it gain [ to him ] that thou makest thy ways perfect ?
DARBY	Job	22	4	Will he reason with thee for fear of thee ? Will he enter with thee into judgment ?
DARBY	Job	22	5	Is not thy wickedness great ? and thine iniquities without end ?
DARBY	Job	22	6	For thou hast taken a pledge of thy brother for nought , and stripped off the clothing of the naked .
DARBY	Job	22	7	Thou hast not given water to the fainting to drink , and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry .
DARBY	Job	22	8	But the powerful man , he had the land ; and the man of high rank dwelt in it .
DARBY	Job	22	9	Widows hast thou sent empty away , and the arms of the fatherless have been broken .
DARBY	Job	22	10	Therefore snares are round about thee , and sudden fear troubleth thee ;
DARBY	Job	22	11	Or darkness , that thou canst not see , and floods of waters cover thee .
DARBY	Job	22	12	Is not +God in the height of the heavens ? And behold the summit of the stars : how exalted are they !
DARBY	Job	22	13	And thou sayest , What doth God know ? will he judge through the dark cloud ?
DARBY	Job	22	14	Thick clouds are a covering to him , that he seeth not ; and he walketh on the vault of the heavens .
DARBY	Job	22	15	Dost thou mark the ancient path which wicked men have trodden ?
DARBY	Job	22	16	Who were carried off before the time , whose foundation was overflowed with a flood ;
DARBY	Job	22	17	Who said unto God , Depart from us ! and what could the Almighty do to them ?
DARBY	Job	22	18	Yet he filled their houses with good . But the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
DARBY	Job	22	19	The righteous see it , and are glad ; and the innocent laugh them to scorn :
DARBY	Job	22	20	Is not he who rose against us destroyed , and doth not the fire consume his residue ?
DARBY	Job	22	21	Reconcile thyself now with him , and be at peace : thereby good shall come unto thee .
DARBY	Job	22	23	If thou return to the Almighty , thou shalt be built up . If thou remove unrighteousness far from thy tents ,
DARBY	Job	22	24	And put the precious ore with the dust , and [ the gold of ] Ophir among the stones of the torrents ,
DARBY	Job	22	25	Then the Almighty will be thy precious ore , and silver heaped up unto thee ;
DARBY	Job	22	26	Yea , then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty , and shalt lift up thy face unto +God :
DARBY	Job	22	27	Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him , and he will hear thee , and thou shalt pay thy vows ;
DARBY	Job	22	28	And thou shalt decree a thing , and it shall be established unto thee ; and light shall shine upon thy ways .
DARBY	Job	22	29	When they are made low , then thou shalt say , Rise up ! and he shall save him that is of downcast eyes .
DARBY	Job	22	30	[ Even ] him that is not innocent shall he deliver ; yea , he shall be delivered by the pureness of thy hands .
DARBY	Job	23	23	And Job answered and said ,
DARBY	Job	23	2	Even to-day is my complaint bitter : my stroke is heavier than my groaning .
DARBY	Job	23	3	Oh that I knew where I might find him , that I might come to his seat !
DARBY	Job	23	4	I would order the cause before him , and fill my mouth with arguments ;
DARBY	Job	23	5	I would know the words he would answer me , and understand what he would say unto me .
DARBY	Job	23	6	Would he plead against me with [ his ] great power ? Nay ; but he would give heed unto me .
DARBY	Job	23	7	There would an upright man reason with him ; and I should be delivered for ever from my judge .
DARBY	Job	23	8	Lo , I go forward , but he is not there ; and backward , but I do not perceive him ;
DARBY	Job	23	9	On the left hand , where he doth work , but I behold [ him ] not ; he hideth himself on the right hand , and I see [ him ] not .
DARBY	Job	23	10	But he knoweth the way that I take ; he trieth me , I shall come forth as gold .
DARBY	Job	23	11	My foot hath held to his steps ; his way have I kept , and not turned aside .
DARBY	Job	23	12	Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips ; I have laid up the words of his mouth more than the purpose of my own heart .
DARBY	Job	23	13	But he is in one [ mind ] , and who can turn him ? And what his soul desireth , that will he do .
DARBY	Job	23	14	For he will perform [ what ] is appointed for me ; and many such things are with him .
DARBY	Job	23	15	Therefore am I troubled at his presence ; I consider , and I am afraid of him .
DARBY	Job	23	16	For God hath made my heart soft , and the Almighty troubleth me ;
DARBY	Job	23	17	Because I was not cut off before the darkness , neither hath he hidden the gloom from me .
DARBY	Job	24	24	They are exalted for a little , and are no more ; they are laid low ; like all [ other ] are they gathered , and are cut off as the tops of the ears of corn .
DARBY	Job	24	2	They remove the landmarks ; they violently take away the flocks and pasture them ;
DARBY	Job	24	3	They drive away the ass of the fatherless , they take the widow 's ox for a pledge ;
DARBY	Job	24	4	They turn the needy out of the way : the afflicted of the land all hide themselves .
DARBY	Job	24	5	Lo , [ as ] wild asses in the desert , they go forth to their work , seeking early for the prey : the wilderness [ yieldeth ] them food for [ their ] children .
DARBY	Job	24	6	They reap in the field the fodder thereof , and they gather the vintage of the wicked ;
DARBY	Job	24	7	They pass the night naked without clothing , and have no covering in the cold ;
DARBY	Job	24	8	They are wet with the showers of the mountains , and for want of a shelter embrace the rock …
DARBY	Job	24	9	They pluck the fatherless from the breast , and take a pledge of the poor :
DARBY	Job	24	10	These go naked without clothing , and , hungry , they bear the sheaf ;
DARBY	Job	24	11	They press out oil within their walls , they tread their winepresses , and suffer thirst .
DARBY	Job	24	12	Men groan from out of the city , and the soul of the wounded crieth out ; and +God imputeth not the impiety .
DARBY	Job	24	13	There are those that rebel against the light ; they know not the ways thereof , nor abide in the paths thereof .
DARBY	Job	24	14	The murderer riseth with the light , killeth the afflicted and needy , and in the night is as a thief .
DARBY	Job	24	15	And the eye of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight , saying , No eye shall see me ; and he putteth a covering on [ his ] face .
DARBY	Job	24	16	In the dark they dig through houses ; by day they shut themselves in ; they know not the light :
DARBY	Job	24	17	For the morning is to them all [ as ] the shadow of death ; for they are familiar with the terrors of the shadow of death .
DARBY	Job	24	18	He is swift on the face of the waters ; their portion is cursed on the earth : he turneth not unto the way of the vineyards .
DARBY	Job	24	19	Drought and heat consume snow waters ; so doth Sheol those that have sinned .
DARBY	Job	24	20	The womb forgetteth him ; the worm feedeth sweetly on him : he shall be no more remembered ; and unrighteousness is broken as a tree , —
DARBY	Job	24	21	He that despoileth the barren that beareth not , and doeth not good to the widow :
DARBY	Job	24	22	He draweth also the mighty with his power ; he riseth up , and no [ man ] is sure of life .
DARBY	Job	24	23	[ God ] setteth him in safety , and he resteth thereon ; but his eyes are upon their ways .
DARBY	Job	24	25	If it be not so now , who will make me a liar , and make my speech nothing worth ?
DARBY	Job	25	25	And Bildad the Shuhite answered and said ,
DARBY	Job	25	2	Dominion and fear are with him ; he maketh peace in his high places .
DARBY	Job	25	3	Is there any number of his troops ? and upon whom doth not his light arise ?
DARBY	Job	25	4	And how should man be just with God ? Or how should he be clean that is born of a woman ?
DARBY	Job	25	5	Lo , even the moon is not bright ; and the stars are not pure in his sight :

DARBY	Job	25	26	% )
DARBY	Job	26	26	And Job answered and said ,
DARBY	Job	26	2	How hast thou helped the powerless ; how saved the arm that is without strength !
DARBY	Job	26	3	How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom , and abundantly declared the thing as it is !
DARBY	Job	26	4	For whom hast thou uttered words ? and whose spirit came from thee ?
DARBY	Job	26	5	The shades tremble beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof ;
DARBY	Job	26	6	Sheol is naked before him , and destruction hath no covering .
DARBY	Job	26	7	He stretcheth out the north over empty space , he hangeth the earth upon nothing ;
DARBY	Job	26	8	He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds , and the cloud is not rent under them .
DARBY	Job	26	9	He covereth the face of his throne , he spreadeth his cloud upon it .
DARBY	Job	26	10	He hath traced a fixed circle over the waters , unto the confines of light and darkness .
DARBY	Job	26	11	The pillars of the heavens tremble and are astonished at his rebuke .
DARBY	Job	26	12	He stirreth up the sea by his power , and by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab .
DARBY	Job	26	13	By his Spirit the heavens are adorned ; his hand hath formed the fleeing serpent .
DARBY	Job	26	14	Lo , these are the borders of his ways ; but what a whisper of a word do we hear of him ! And the thunder of his power , who can understand ?
DARBY	Job	27	27	And Job continued his parable and said ,
DARBY	Job	27	2	[ As ] God liveth , who hath taken away my right , and the Almighty , who hath embittered my soul ,
DARBY	Job	27	3	All the while my breath is in me , and the spirit of +God is in my nostrils ,
DARBY	Job	27	4	My lips shall not speak unrighteousness , nor my tongue utter deceit !
DARBY	Job	27	5	Be it far from me that I should justify you ; till I die I will not remove my blamelessness from me .
DARBY	Job	27	6	My righteousness I hold fast , and will not let it go : my heart reproacheth [ me ] not one of my days .
DARBY	Job	27	7	Let mine enemy be as the wicked , and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous .
DARBY	Job	27	8	For what is the hope of the ungodly , when [ God ] cutteth him off , when +God taketh away his soul ?
DARBY	Job	27	9	Will God hear his cry when distress cometh upon him ?
DARBY	Job	27	10	Doth he delight himself in the Almighty ? will he at all times call upon +God ?
DARBY	Job	27	11	I will teach you concerning the hand of God ; what is with the Almighty will I not conceal .
DARBY	Job	27	12	Behold , ye yourselves have all seen [ it ] ; and why are ye thus altogether vain ?
DARBY	Job	27	13	This is the portion of the wicked man with God , and the heritage of the violent , which they receive from the Almighty : —
DARBY	Job	27	14	If his children be multiplied , it is for the sword , and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread ;
DARBY	Job	27	15	Those that remain of him shall be buried by death , and his widows shall not weep .
DARBY	Job	27	16	Though he heap up silver as the dust , and prepare clothing as the clay ;
DARBY	Job	27	17	He may prepare it , but the just shall put it on ; and the innocent shall divide the silver .
DARBY	Job	27	18	He buildeth his house as the moth , and as a booth that a keeper maketh .
DARBY	Job	27	19	He lieth down rich , but will do so no more ; he openeth his eyes , and he is not .
DARBY	Job	27	20	Terrors overtake him like waters ; a whirlwind stealeth him away in the night .
DARBY	Job	27	21	The east wind carrieth him away and he is gone ; and as a storm it hurleth him out of his place .
DARBY	Job	27	22	And [ God ] shall cast upon him and not spare : he would fain flee out of his hand .
DARBY	Job	27	23	[ Men ] shall clap their hands at him , and shall hiss him out of his place .
DARBY	Job	28	28	And unto man he said , Lo , the fear of the Lord , that is wisdom ; and to depart from evil is understanding .
DARBY	Job	28	2	Iron is taken out of the dust , and copper is molten out of the stone .
DARBY	Job	28	3	[ Man ] putteth an end to the darkness , and exploreth to the utmost limit , the stones of darkness and of the shadow of death .
DARBY	Job	28	4	He openeth a shaft far from the inhabitants [ of the earth ] : forgotten of the foot , they hang suspended ; away below men they hover .
DARBY	Job	28	5	As for the earth , out of it cometh bread , and underneath it is turned up as by fire ;
DARBY	Job	28	6	The stones of it are the place of sapphires , and it hath dust of gold .
DARBY	Job	28	7	It is a path no bird of prey knoweth , and the vulture 's eye hath not seen it ;
DARBY	Job	28	8	The proud beasts have not trodden it , nor the fierce lion passed over it .
DARBY	Job	28	9	[ Man ] putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock , he overturneth the mountains by the root .
DARBY	Job	28	10	He cutteth out channels in the rocks , and his eye seeth every precious thing .
DARBY	Job	28	11	He bindeth the streams that they drip not , and what is hidden he bringeth forth to light .
DARBY	Job	28	12	But wisdom , where shall it be found ? and where is the place of understanding ?
DARBY	Job	28	13	Man knoweth not the value thereof ; and it is not found in the land of the living .
DARBY	Job	28	14	The deep saith , It is not in me ; and the sea saith , It is not with me .
DARBY	Job	28	15	Choice gold can not be given for it , nor silver be weighed for its price .
DARBY	Job	28	16	It is not set in the balance with gold of Ophir , with the precious onyx , and the sapphire .
DARBY	Job	28	17	Gold and glass can not be compared to it , nor vessels of fine gold be its exchange .
DARBY	Job	28	18	Corals and crystal are no more remembered ; yea , the acquisition of wisdom is above rubies .
DARBY	Job	28	19	The topaz of Ethiopia shall not be compared to it , neither shall it be set in the balance with pure gold .
DARBY	Job	28	20	Whence then cometh wisdom ? and where is the place of understanding ?
DARBY	Job	28	21	For it is hidden from the eyes of all living , and concealed from the fowl of the heavens .
DARBY	Job	28	22	Destruction and death say , We have heard its report with our ears .
DARBY	Job	28	23	God understandeth the way thereof , and he knoweth its place :
DARBY	Job	28	24	For he looketh to the ends of the earth , he seeth under the whole heaven .
DARBY	Job	28	25	In making a weight for the wind , and meting out the waters by measure ,
DARBY	Job	28	26	In appointing a statute for the rain , and a way for the thunder 's flash :
DARBY	Job	28	27	Then did he see it , and declare it ; he established it , yea , and searched it out ;
DARBY	Job	29	29	And Job continued his parable and said ,
DARBY	Job	29	2	Oh that I were as in months past , as in the days when +God preserved me ;
DARBY	Job	29	3	When his lamp shone over my head , [ and ] by his light I walked through darkness ;
DARBY	Job	29	4	As I was in the days of my youth , when the secret counsel of +God was over my tent ,
DARBY	Job	29	5	When the Almighty was yet with me , my young men round about me ;
DARBY	Job	29	6	When my steps were bathed in milk , and the rock poured out beside me rivers of oil ! …
DARBY	Job	29	7	When I went out to the gate by the city , when I prepared my seat on the broadway ,
DARBY	Job	29	8	The young men saw me , and hid themselves ; and the aged arose [ and ] stood up ;
DARBY	Job	29	9	Princes refrained from talking , and laid the hand on their mouth ;
DARBY	Job	29	10	The voice of the nobles was hushed , and their tongue cleaved to their palate .
DARBY	Job	29	11	When the ear heard [ me ] , then it blessed me , and when the eye saw [ me ] , it gave witness to me ;
DARBY	Job	29	12	For I delivered the afflicted that cried , and the fatherless who had no helper .
DARBY	Job	29	13	The blessing of him that was perishing came upon me , and I caused the widow 's heart to sing for joy .
DARBY	Job	29	14	I put on righteousness , and it clothed me ; my justice was as a mantle and a turban .
DARBY	Job	29	15	I was eyes to the blind , and feet was I to the lame ;
DARBY	Job	29	16	I was a father to the needy , and the cause which I knew not I searched out ;
DARBY	Job	29	17	And I broke the jaws of the unrighteous , and plucked the spoil out of his teeth .
DARBY	Job	29	18	And I said , I shall die in my nest , and multiply my days as the sand ;
DARBY	Job	29	19	My root shall be spread out to the waters , and the dew will lie all night on my branch ;
DARBY	Job	29	20	My glory shall be fresh in me , and my bow be renewed in my hand .
DARBY	Job	29	21	Unto me they listened , and waited , and kept silence for my counsel :
DARBY	Job	29	22	After my words they spoke not again , and my speech dropped upon them ;
DARBY	Job	29	23	And they waited for me as for the rain , and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain .
DARBY	Job	29	24	[ If ] I laughed on them , they believed [ it ] not ; and they troubled not the serenity of my countenance .
DARBY	Job	29	25	I chose their way , and sat as chief , and dwelt as a king in the army , as one that comforteth mourners .
DARBY	Job	30	30	My skin is become black [ and falleth ] off me , and my bones are parched with heat .
DARBY	Job	30	2	Yea , whereto [ should ] the strength of their hands [ profit ] me , [ men ] in whom vigour hath perished ?
DARBY	Job	30	3	Withered up through want and hunger , they flee into waste places long since desolate and desert :
DARBY	Job	30	4	They gather the salt-wort among the bushes , and the roots of the broom for their food .
DARBY	Job	30	5	They are driven forth from among [ men ] —they cry after them as after a thief—
DARBY	Job	30	6	To dwell in gloomy gorges , in caves of the earth and the rocks :
DARBY	Job	30	7	They bray among the bushes ; under the brambles they are gathered together :
DARBY	Job	30	8	Sons of fools , and sons of nameless sires , they are driven out of the land .
DARBY	Job	30	9	And now I am their song , yea , I am their byword .
DARBY	Job	30	10	They abhor me , they stand aloof from me , yea , they spare not to spit in my face .
DARBY	Job	30	11	For he hath loosed my cord and afflicted me ; so they cast off the bridle before me .
DARBY	Job	30	12	At [ my ] right hand rise the young brood ; they push away my feet , and raise up against me their pernicious ways ;
DARBY	Job	30	13	They mar my path , they set forward my calamity , without any to help them ;
DARBY	Job	30	14	They come in as through a wide breach : amid the confusion they roll themselves onward .
DARBY	Job	30	15	Terrors are turned against me ; they pursue mine honour as the wind ; and my welfare is passed away like a cloud .
DARBY	Job	30	16	And now my soul is poured out in me ; days of affliction have taken hold upon me .
DARBY	Job	30	17	The night pierceth through my bones [ and detacheth them ] from me , and my gnawing pains take no rest :
DARBY	Job	30	18	By their great force they have become my raiment ; they bind me about as the collar of my coat .
DARBY	Job	30	19	He hath cast me into the mire , and I have become like dust and ashes .
DARBY	Job	30	20	I cry unto thee , and thou answerest me not ; I stand up , and thou lookest at me .
DARBY	Job	30	21	Thou art changed to a cruel one to me ; with the strength of thy hand thou pursuest me .
DARBY	Job	30	22	Thou liftest me up to the wind ; thou causest me to be borne away , and dissolvest my substance .
DARBY	Job	30	23	For I know that thou wilt bring me to death , and into the house of assemblage for all living .
DARBY	Job	30	24	Indeed , no prayer [ availeth ] when he stretcheth out [ his ] hand : though they cry when he destroyeth .
DARBY	Job	30	25	Did not I weep for him whose days were hard ? was not my soul grieved for the needy ?
DARBY	Job	30	26	For I expected good , and there came evil ; and I waited for light , but there came darkness .
DARBY	Job	30	27	My bowels well up , and rest not ; days of affliction have confronted me .
DARBY	Job	30	28	I go about blackened , but not by the sun ; I stand up , I cry in the congregation .
DARBY	Job	30	29	I am become a brother to jackals , and a companion of ostriches .
DARBY	Job	30	31	My harp also is [ turned ] to mourning , and my pipe into the voice of weepers .
DARBY	Job	31	31	If the men of my tent said not , Who shall find one that hath not been satisfied with his meat ? —
DARBY	Job	31	2	For what would have been [ my ] portion of +God from above , and what the heritage of the Almighty from on high ?
DARBY	Job	31	3	Is not calamity for the unrighteous ? and misfortune for the workers of iniquity ?
DARBY	Job	31	4	Doth not he see my ways , and number all my steps ?
DARBY	Job	31	5	If I have walked with falsehood , and my foot hath hasted to deceit ,
DARBY	Job	31	6	( Let me be weighed in an even balance , and +God will take knowledge of my blamelessness ; )
DARBY	Job	31	7	If my step have turned out of the way , and my heart followed mine eyes , and if any blot cleaveth to my hands ;
DARBY	Job	31	8	Let me sow , and another eat ; and let mine offspring be rooted out .
DARBY	Job	31	9	If my heart have been enticed unto a woman , so that I laid wait at my neighbour 's door ,
DARBY	Job	31	10	Let my wife grind for another , and let others bow down upon her .
DARBY	Job	31	11	For this is an infamy ; yea , it is an iniquity [ to be judged by ] the judges :
DARBY	Job	31	12	For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction , and would root out all mine increase .
DARBY	Job	31	13	If I have despised the cause of my bondman or of my bondmaid , when they contended with me ,
DARBY	Job	31	14	What then should I do when God riseth up ? and if he visited , what should I answer him ?
DARBY	Job	31	15	Did not he that made me in the womb make him ? and did not One fashion us in the womb ?
DARBY	Job	31	16	If I have withheld the poor from [ their ] desire , or caused the eyes of the widow to fail ;
DARBY	Job	31	17	Or have eaten my morsel alone , so that the fatherless ate not thereof ,
DARBY	Job	31	18	( For from my youth he grew up with me as with a father , and I have guided the [ widow ] from my mother 's womb ; )
DARBY	Job	31	19	If I have seen any perishing for want of clothing , or any needy without covering ;
DARBY	Job	31	20	If his loins have not blessed me , and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my lambs ;
DARBY	Job	31	21	If I have lifted up my hand against an orphan , because I saw my help in the gate :
DARBY	Job	31	22	[ Then ] let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade , and mine arm be broken from the bone !
DARBY	Job	31	23	For calamity from God was a terror to me , and by reason of his excellency I was powerless .
DARBY	Job	31	24	If I have made gold my hope , or said to the fine gold , My confidence !
DARBY	Job	31	25	If I rejoiced because my wealth was great , and because my hand had gotten much ;
DARBY	Job	31	26	If I beheld the sun when it shone , or the moon walking in brightness ,
DARBY	Job	31	27	And my heart have been secretly enticed , so that my mouth kissed my hand :
DARBY	Job	31	28	This also would be an iniquity for the judge , for I should have denied the God who is above .
DARBY	Job	31	29	If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me , and exulted when evil befell him ;
DARBY	Job	31	30	( Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse ; )
DARBY	Job	31	32	The stranger did not lodge without ; I opened my doors to the pathway .
DARBY	Job	31	33	If I covered my transgressions as Adam , by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom ,
DARBY	Job	31	34	Because I feared the great multitude , and the contempt of families terrified me , so that I kept silence , and went not out of the door , …
DARBY	Job	31	35	Oh that I had one to hear me ! Behold my signature : let the Almighty answer me ! And let mine opponent write an accusation !
DARBY	Job	31	36	Would I not take it upon my shoulder ? I would bind it on to me [ as ] a crown ;
DARBY	Job	31	37	I would declare unto him the number of my steps ; as a prince would I come near to him .
DARBY	Job	31	38	If my land cry out against me , and its furrows weep together ;
DARBY	Job	31	39	If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money , and have tormented to death the souls of its owners :
DARBY	Job	31	40	Let thistles grow instead of wheat , and tares instead of barley . The words of Job are ended .
DARBY	Job	32	32	And these three men ceased to answer Job , because he was righteous in his own eyes .
DARBY	Job	32	2	Then was kindled the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel , the Buzite , of the family of Ram : against Job was his anger kindled , because he justified himself rather than God ;
DARBY	Job	32	3	and against his three friends was his anger kindled , because they found no answer , and [ yet ] condemned Job .
DARBY	Job	32	4	But Elihu had waited till Job had finished speaking , because they were older than he .
DARBY	Job	32	5	And Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men , and his anger was kindled .
DARBY	Job	32	6	And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said , I am young , and ye are aged ; wherefore I was timid , and feared to shew you what I know .
DARBY	Job	32	7	I said , Let days speak , and multitude of years teach wisdom .
DARBY	Job	32	8	But there is a spirit which is in man ; and the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding .
DARBY	Job	32	9	It is not the great that are wise ; neither do the aged understand judgment .
DARBY	Job	32	10	Therefore I say , Hearken to me ; I also will shew what I know .
DARBY	Job	32	11	Lo , I waited for your words ; I gave ear to your reasonings , until ye searched out what to say .
DARBY	Job	32	12	Yea , I gave you mine attention , and behold , there was none of you that confuted Job , that answered his words ;
DARBY	Job	32	13	That ye may not say , We have found out wisdom ; God will make him yield , not man .
DARBY	Job	32	14	Now he hath not directed [ his ] words against me ; and I will not answer him with your speeches . …
DARBY	Job	32	15	They were amazed , they answered no more ; words failed them .
DARBY	Job	32	16	And I waited , for they spoke not , but stood still , and answered no more ; —
DARBY	Job	32	17	I will answer , I also in my turn , I also will shew what I know :
DARBY	Job	32	18	For I am full of matter , the spirit within me constraineth me .
DARBY	Job	32	19	Behold , my belly is as wine which hath no vent ; like new flasks , it is ready to burst .
DARBY	Job	32	20	I will speak , that I may find relief ; I will open my lips and answer .
DARBY	Job	32	21	Let me not , I pray you , accept any man 's person ; neither will I give flattery to man .
DARBY	Job	32	22	For I know not how to flatter ; my Maker would soon take me away .
DARBY	Job	33	33	If not , hearken thou unto me ; be silent , and I will teach thee wisdom .
DARBY	Job	33	2	Behold now , I have opened my mouth , my tongue speaketh in my palate ,
DARBY	Job	33	3	My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart , and my lips shall utter knowledge purely .
DARBY	Job	33	4	The Spirit of God hath made me , and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life .
DARBY	Job	33	5	If thou canst , answer me ; array [ thy words ] before me : take thy stand .
DARBY	Job	33	6	Behold , before God I am as thou ; I also am formed out of the clay .
DARBY	Job	33	7	Behold , my terror shall not make thee afraid , nor my burden be heavy upon thee .
DARBY	Job	33	8	Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing , and I have heard the voice of [ thy ] words : —
DARBY	Job	33	9	I am clean without transgression ; I am pure , and there is no iniquity in me ;
DARBY	Job	33	10	Lo , he findeth occasions of hostility against me , he counteth me for his enemy ;
DARBY	Job	33	11	He putteth my feet in the stocks , he marketh all my paths .
DARBY	Job	33	12	Behold , I will answer thee in this , thou art not right ; for +God is greater than man .
DARBY	Job	33	13	Why dost thou strive against him ? for he giveth not account of any of his matters .
DARBY	Job	33	14	For God speaketh once , and twice , — [ and man ] perceiveth it not—
DARBY	Job	33	15	In a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falleth upon men , in slumberings upon the bed ;
DARBY	Job	33	16	Then he openeth men 's ears , and sealeth their instruction ,
DARBY	Job	33	17	That he may withdraw man [ from his ] work , and hide pride from man .
DARBY	Job	33	18	He keepeth back his soul from the pit , and his life from passing away by the sword .
DARBY	Job	33	19	He is chastened also with pain upon his bed , and with constant strife in his bones ;
DARBY	Job	33	20	And his life abhorreth bread , and his soul dainty food ;
DARBY	Job	33	21	His flesh is consumed away from view , and his bones that were not seen stick out ;
DARBY	Job	33	22	And his soul draweth near to the pit , and his life to the destroyers .
DARBY	Job	33	23	If there be a messenger with him , an interpreter , one among a thousand , to shew unto man his duty ;
DARBY	Job	33	24	Then he will be gracious unto him , and say , Deliver him from going down to the pit : I have found a ransom .
DARBY	Job	33	25	His flesh shall be fresher than in childhood ; he shall return to the days of his youth .
DARBY	Job	33	26	He shall pray unto +God , and he will receive him with favour ; and he shall see his face with shoutings , and he will render unto man his righteousness .
DARBY	Job	33	27	He will sing before men , and say , I have sinned , and perverted what was right , and it hath not been requited to me ;
DARBY	Job	33	28	He hath delivered my soul from going into the pit , and my life shall see the light .
DARBY	Job	33	29	Lo , all these [ things ] worketh God twice , thrice , with man ,
DARBY	Job	33	30	To bring back his soul from the pit , that he may be enlightened with the light of the living .
DARBY	Job	33	31	Mark well , Job , hearken unto me ; be silent , and I will speak .
DARBY	Job	33	32	If thou hast anything to say , answer me ; speak , for I desire to justify thee .
DARBY	Job	34	34	Men of understanding will say to me , and a wise man who heareth me :
DARBY	Job	34	2	Hear my words , ye wise [ men ] ; and give ear unto me , ye that have knowledge .
DARBY	Job	34	3	For the ear trieth words , as the palate tasteth food .
DARBY	Job	34	4	Let us choose for ourselves what is right ; let us know among ourselves what is good !
DARBY	Job	34	5	For Job hath said , I am righteous , and God hath taken away my judgment :
DARBY	Job	34	6	Should I lie against my right ? My wound is incurable without transgression .
DARBY	Job	34	7	What man is like Job ? he drinketh up scorning like water ,
DARBY	Job	34	8	And goeth in company with workers of iniquity , and walketh with wicked men .
DARBY	Job	34	9	For he hath said , It profiteth not a man if he delight himself in God .
DARBY	Job	34	10	Therefore hearken unto me , ye men of understanding : Far be wickedness from God , and wrong from the Almighty !
DARBY	Job	34	11	For a man 's work will he render to him , and cause every one to find according to [ his ] way .
DARBY	Job	34	12	Yea , surely , God acteth not wickedly , and the Almighty perverteth not judgment .
DARBY	Job	34	13	Who hath entrusted to him the earth ? and who hath disposed the whole world ?
DARBY	Job	34	14	If he only thought of himself , [ and ] gathered unto him his spirit and his breath ,
DARBY	Job	34	15	All flesh would expire together , and man would return to the dust .
DARBY	Job	34	16	If now [ thou hast ] understanding , hear this : give ear to the voice of my words !
DARBY	Job	34	17	Should he that hateth right indeed govern ? and wilt thou condemn the All-just ?
DARBY	Job	34	18	Shall one say to a king , Belial ? to nobles , Wicked ?
DARBY	Job	34	19	[ How then to him ] that accepteth not the persons of princes , nor regardeth the rich man more than the poor ? for they are all the work of his hands .
DARBY	Job	34	20	In a moment they die , even at midnight the people are convulsed and pass away ; and the strong are taken away without hand .
DARBY	Job	34	21	For his eyes are upon the ways of man , and he seeth all his steps .
DARBY	Job	34	22	There is no darkness , nor shadow of death , where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves .
DARBY	Job	34	23	For he doth not long consider a man , to bring him before God in judgment .
DARBY	Job	34	24	He breaketh in pieces mighty men without inquiry , and setteth others in their stead ;
DARBY	Job	34	25	Since he knoweth their actions ; and he overthroweth [ them ] in the night , and they are crushed .
DARBY	Job	34	26	He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others ,
DARBY	Job	34	27	Because they have turned back from him , and would consider none of his ways ;
DARBY	Job	34	28	So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him , and he heareth the cry of the afflicted .
DARBY	Job	34	29	When he giveth quietness , who then will disturb ? and when he hideth [ his ] face , who shall behold him ? and this towards a nation , or towards a man alike ;
DARBY	Job	34	30	That the ungodly man reign not , that the people be not ensnared .
DARBY	Job	34	31	For hath he said unto God , I bear [ chastisement ] , I will not offend ;
DARBY	Job	34	32	What I see not , teach thou me ; if I have done wrong , I will do so no more ?
DARBY	Job	34	33	Shall he recompense according to thy mind ? for thou hast refused [ his judgment ] ; for thou so choosest , and not I ; speak then what thou knowest .
DARBY	Job	34	35	Job hath spoken without knowledge , and his words were not with intelligence .
DARBY	Job	34	36	Would that Job may be tried unto the end , because of [ his ] answers after the manner of evil men !
DARBY	Job	34	37	For he addeth rebellion unto his sin , he clappeth [ his hands ] among us , and multiplieth his words against God .
DARBY	Job	35	35	Moreover Elihu answered and said ,
DARBY	Job	35	2	Thinkest thou this to be right , that thou saidst , My righteousness is more than God 's ?
DARBY	Job	35	3	For thou hast asked of what profit it is unto thee : what do I gain more than if I had sinned ?
DARBY	Job	35	4	I will reply to thee in words , and to thy companions with thee .
DARBY	Job	35	5	Look unto the heavens and see ; and survey the skies : they are higher than thou .
DARBY	Job	35	6	If thou sinnest , what doest thou against him ? If thy transgressions be multiplied , what doest thou unto him ?
DARBY	Job	35	7	If thou be righteous , what givest thou to him ? or what doth he receive of thy hand ?
DARBY	Job	35	8	Thy wickedness [ may affect ] a man as thou [ art ] , and thy righteousness a son of man .
DARBY	Job	35	9	By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry ; they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty :
DARBY	Job	35	10	But none saith , Where is +God my Maker , who giveth songs in the night ,
DARBY	Job	35	11	Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth , and maketh us wiser than the fowl of the heavens ?
DARBY	Job	35	12	There they cry , and he answereth not , because of the pride of evil men .
DARBY	Job	35	13	Surely God will not hear vanity , neither will the Almighty regard it .
DARBY	Job	35	14	Although thou sayest thou dost not see him , judgment is before him , therefore wait for him .
DARBY	Job	35	15	But now , because he hath not visited in his anger , doth not [ Job ] know [ his ] great arrogancy ?
DARBY	Job	35	16	For Job hath opened his mouth in vanity , and made words abundant without knowledge .
DARBY	Job	36	36	And Elihu proceeded and said ,
DARBY	Job	36	2	Suffer me a little , and I will shew thee that I have yet words for +God .
DARBY	Job	36	3	I will fetch my knowledge from afar , and will ascribe righteousness to my Creator .
DARBY	Job	36	4	For truly my words shall be no falsehood : one perfect in knowledge is with thee .
DARBY	Job	36	5	Lo , God is mighty , but despiseth not [ any ] ; mighty in strength of understanding :
DARBY	Job	36	6	He saveth not the wicked alive ; but he doeth justice to the afflicted .
DARBY	Job	36	7	He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous , but with kings on the throne doth he even set them for ever ; and they are exalted .
DARBY	Job	36	8	And if , bound in fetters , they be held in cords of affliction ,
DARBY	Job	36	9	Then he sheweth them their work , and their transgressions , because they have increased .
DARBY	Job	36	10	And he openeth their ear to discipline , and commandeth that they return from iniquity .
DARBY	Job	36	11	If they hearken and serve [ him ] , they shall accomplish their days in prosperity , and their years in pleasures .
DARBY	Job	36	12	But if they hearken not , they shall pass away by the sword , and expire without knowledge .
DARBY	Job	36	13	But the godless in heart heap up anger ; they cry not when he bindeth them :
DARBY	Job	36	14	Their soul dieth in youth , and their life is among the unclean .
DARBY	Job	36	15	But he delivereth the afflicted in his affliction , and openeth their ear in [ their ] oppression .
DARBY	Job	36	16	Even so would he have allured thee out of the jaws of distress into a broad place , where there is no straitness ; and the supply of thy table [ would be ] full of fatness .
DARBY	Job	36	17	But thou art full of the judgments of the wicked : judgment and justice take hold [ on thee ] .
DARBY	Job	36	18	Because there is wrath , [ beware ] lest it take thee away through chastisement : then a great ransom could not avail thee .
DARBY	Job	36	19	Will he esteem thy riches ? Not gold , nor all the resources of strength !
DARBY	Job	36	20	Desire not the night , when peoples are cut off from their place .
DARBY	Job	36	21	Take heed , turn not to iniquity ; for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction .
DARBY	Job	36	22	Lo , God is exalted in his power : who teacheth as he ?
DARBY	Job	36	23	Who hath appointed him his way ? or who hath said , Thou hast wrought unrighteousness ?
DARBY	Job	36	24	Remember that thou magnify his work , which men celebrate .
DARBY	Job	36	25	All men look at it ; man beholdeth [ it ] afar off .
DARBY	Job	36	26	Lo , God is great , and we comprehend [ him ] not , neither can the number of his years be searched out .
DARBY	Job	36	27	For he draweth up the drops of water : they distil in rain from the vapour which he formeth ,
DARBY	Job	36	28	Which the skies pour down [ and ] drop upon man abundantly .
DARBY	Job	36	29	But can any understand the spreadings of the clouds , [ or ] the crashing of his pavilion ?
DARBY	Job	36	30	Lo , he spreadeth his light around him , and covereth the bottom of the sea .
DARBY	Job	36	31	For with them he judgeth the peoples ; he giveth food in abundance .
DARBY	Job	36	32	[ His ] hands he covereth with lightning , and commandeth it where it is to strike .
DARBY	Job	36	33	His thundering declareth concerning him ; the cattle even , concerning its coming .
DARBY	Job	37	37	Aye , my heart trembleth at this also , and leapeth up out of its place :
DARBY	Job	37	2	Hear attentively the roar of his voice , and the murmur going forth from his mouth .
DARBY	Job	37	3	He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven , and his lightning unto the ends of the earth .
DARBY	Job	37	4	After it a voice roareth : he thundereth with the voice of his excellency , and holdeth not back the flashes when his voice is heard .
DARBY	Job	37	5	God thundereth marvellously with his voice , doing great things which we do not comprehend .
DARBY	Job	37	6	For he saith to the snow , Fall on the earth ! and to the pouring rain , even the pouring rains of his might .
DARBY	Job	37	7	He sealeth up the hand of every man ; that all men may know his work .
DARBY	Job	37	8	And the wild beast goeth into its lair , and they remain in their dens .
DARBY	Job	37	9	From the chamber [ of the south ] cometh the whirlwind ; and cold from the winds of the north .
DARBY	Job	37	10	By the breath of God ice is given ; and the breadth of the waters is straitened .
DARBY	Job	37	11	Also with plentiful moisture he loadeth the thick clouds , his light dispels the cloud ;
DARBY	Job	37	12	And they are turned every way by his guidance , that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the circuit of the earth ,
DARBY	Job	37	13	Whether he cause it to come as a rod , or for his land , or in mercy .
DARBY	Job	37	14	Hearken unto this , Job ; stand still and discern the wondrous works of God .
DARBY	Job	37	15	Dost thou know how +God hath disposed them , and how he causeth the lightning of his cloud to flash ?
DARBY	Job	37	16	Dost thou know about the balancings of the clouds , the wondrous works of him that is perfect in knowledge ?
DARBY	Job	37	17	How thy garments become warm when he quieteth the earth by the south wind ?
DARBY	Job	37	18	Hast thou with him spread out the sky , firm , like a molten mirror ?
DARBY	Job	37	19	Teach us what we shall say unto him ! We can not order [ our words ] by reason of darkness .
DARBY	Job	37	20	Shall it be told him if I would speak ? if a man [ so ] say , surely he shall be swallowed up .
DARBY	Job	37	21	And now [ men ] see not the light as it gleameth , it is [ hidden ] in the skies . But the wind passeth by and cleareth them .
DARBY	Job	37	22	From the north cometh gold ; with +God is terrible majesty .
DARBY	Job	37	23	The Almighty , we can not find him out : excellent in power , and in judgment , and in abundance of justice , he doth not afflict .
DARBY	Job	37	24	Men do therefore fear him : he respecteth not any that are wise of heart .
DARBY	Job	38	38	When the dust runneth as into a molten mass , and the clods cleave fast together ?
DARBY	Job	38	2	Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge ?
DARBY	Job	38	3	Gird up now thy loins like a man ; and I will demand of thee , and inform thou me .
DARBY	Job	38	4	Where wast thou when I founded the earth ? Declare , if thou hast understanding .
DARBY	Job	38	5	Who set the measures thereof—if thou knowest ? or who stretched a line upon it ?
DARBY	Job	38	6	Whereupon were the foundations thereof sunken ? or who laid its corner-stone ,
DARBY	Job	38	7	When the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy ?
DARBY	Job	38	8	And who shut up the sea with doors , when it burst forth , issuing out of the womb ?
DARBY	Job	38	9	When I made the cloud its garment , and thick darkness a swaddling band for it ;
DARBY	Job	38	10	When I cut out for it my boundary , and set bars and doors ,
DARBY	Job	38	11	And said , Hitherto shalt thou come and no further , and here shall thy proud waves be stayed ?
DARBY	Job	38	12	Hast thou since thy days commanded the morning ? hast thou caused the dawn to know its place ,
DARBY	Job	38	13	That it might take hold of the ends of the earth , and the wicked might be shaken out of it ?
DARBY	Job	38	14	It is changed like the signet-clay ; and [ all things ] stand forth as in a garment :
DARBY	Job	38	15	And from the wicked their light is withholden , and the uplifted arm is broken .
DARBY	Job	38	16	Hast thou entered as far as the springs of the sea ? and hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep ?
DARBY	Job	38	17	Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee ? and hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death ?
DARBY	Job	38	18	Hath thine understanding compassed the breadths of the earth ? Declare if thou knowest it all .
DARBY	Job	38	19	Where is the way to where light dwelleth ? and the darkness , where is its place ,
DARBY	Job	38	20	That thou shouldest take it to its bound , and that thou shouldest know the paths to its house ?
DARBY	Job	38	21	Thou knowest , for thou wast then born , and the number of thy days is great !
DARBY	Job	38	22	Hast thou entered into the storehouses of the snow , and hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail ,
DARBY	Job	38	23	Which I have reserved for the time of distress , for the day of battle and war ?
DARBY	Job	38	24	By what way is the light parted , [ and ] the east wind scattered upon the earth ?
DARBY	Job	38	25	Who hath divided a channel for the rain-flood , and a way for the thunder 's flash ;
DARBY	Job	38	26	To cause it to rain on the earth , where no one is ; on the wilderness wherein there is not a man ;
DARBY	Job	38	27	To satisfy the desolate and waste [ ground ] , and to cause the sprout of the grass to spring forth ?
DARBY	Job	38	28	Hath the rain a father ? or who begetteth the drops of dew ?
DARBY	Job	38	29	Out of whose womb cometh the ice ? and the hoary frost of heaven , who bringeth it forth ?
DARBY	Job	38	30	When the waters lie hidden as in stone , and the face of the deep holdeth fast together .
DARBY	Job	38	31	Canst thou fasten the bands of the Pleiades , or loosen the cords of Orion ?
DARBY	Job	38	32	Dost thou bring forth the constellations each in its season ? or dost thou guide the Bear with her sons ?
DARBY	Job	38	33	Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens ? dost thou determine their rule over the earth ?
DARBY	Job	38	34	Dost thou lift up thy voice to the clouds , that floods of waters may cover thee ?
DARBY	Job	38	35	Dost thou send forth lightnings that they may go , and say unto thee , Here we are ?
DARBY	Job	38	36	Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts ? or who hath given understanding to the mind ?
DARBY	Job	38	37	Who numbereth the clouds with wisdom ? or who poureth out the bottles of the heavens ,
DARBY	Job	38	39	Dost thou hunt the prey for the lioness , and dost thou satisfy the appetite of the young lions ,
DARBY	Job	38	40	When they crouch in [ their ] dens , [ and ] abide in the thicket to lie in wait ?
DARBY	Job	38	41	Who provideth for the raven his food , when his young ones cry unto God , [ and ] they wander for lack of meat ?
DARBY	Job	39	39	Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth ? dost thou mark the calving of the hinds ?
DARBY	Job	39	2	Dost thou number the months that they fulfil ? and knowest thou the time when they bring forth ?
DARBY	Job	39	3	They bow themselves , they give birth to their young ones , they cast out their pains ;
DARBY	Job	39	4	Their young ones become strong , they grow up in the open field , they go forth , and return not unto them .
DARBY	Job	39	5	Who hath sent out the wild ass free ? and who hath loosed the bands of the onager ,
DARBY	Job	39	6	Whose house I made the wilderness , and the salt plain his dwellings ?
DARBY	Job	39	7	He laugheth at the tumult of the city , and heareth not the shouts of the driver ;
DARBY	Job	39	8	The range of the mountains is his pasture , and he searcheth after every green thing .
DARBY	Job	39	9	Will the buffalo be willing to serve thee , or will he lodge by thy crib ?
DARBY	Job	39	10	Canst thou bind the buffalo with his cord in the furrow ? or will he harrow the valleys after thee ?
DARBY	Job	39	11	Wilt thou put confidence in him , because his strength is great ? and wilt thou leave thy labour to him ?
DARBY	Job	39	12	Wilt thou trust him to bring home thy seed , and gather it into thy threshing-floor ?
DARBY	Job	39	13	The wing of the ostrich beats joyously—But is it the stork 's pinion and plumage ?
DARBY	Job	39	14	For she leaveth her eggs to the earth , and warmeth them in the dust ,
DARBY	Job	39	15	And forgetteth that the foot may crush them , or that the beast of the field may trample them .
DARBY	Job	39	16	She is hardened against her young ones , as though they were not hers ; her labour is in vain , without her concern .
DARBY	Job	39	17	For +God hath deprived her of wisdom , and hath not furnished her with understanding .
DARBY	Job	39	18	What time she lasheth herself on high , she scorneth the horse and his rider .
DARBY	Job	39	19	Hast thou given strength to the horse ? hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane ?
DARBY	Job	39	20	Dost thou make him to leap as a locust ? His majestic snorting is terrible .
DARBY	Job	39	21	He paweth in the valley , and rejoiceth in [ his ] strength ; he goeth forth to meet the armed host .
DARBY	Job	39	22	He laugheth at fear , and is not affrighted ; neither turneth he back from before the sword .
DARBY	Job	39	23	The quiver rattleth upon him , the glittering spear and the javelin .
DARBY	Job	39	24	He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage , and can not contain himself at the sound of the trumpet :
DARBY	Job	39	25	At the noise of the trumpets he saith , Aha ! and he smelleth the battle afar off , the thunder of the captains , and the shouting .
DARBY	Job	39	26	Doth the hawk fly by thine intelligence , [ and ] stretch his wings toward the south ?
DARBY	Job	39	27	Doth the eagle mount up at thy command , and make his nest on high ?
DARBY	Job	39	28	He inhabiteth the rock and maketh his dwelling on the point of the cliff , and the fastness :
DARBY	Job	39	29	From thence he spieth out the prey , his eyes look into the distance ;
DARBY	Job	39	30	And his young ones suck up blood ; and where the slain are , there is he .
DARBY	Job	40	40	And Jehovah answered Job and said ,
DARBY	Job	40	2	Shall he that will contend with the Almighty instruct [ him ] ? he that reproveth +God , let him answer it .
DARBY	Job	40	3	And Job answered Jehovah and said ,
DARBY	Job	40	4	Behold , I am nought : what shall I answer thee ? I will lay my hand upon my mouth .
DARBY	Job	40	5	Once have I spoken , and I will not answer ; yea twice , but I will proceed no further .
DARBY	Job	40	6	And Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind and said ,
DARBY	Job	40	7	Gird up now thy loins like a man : I will demand of thee , and inform thou me .
DARBY	Job	40	8	Wilt thou also annul my judgment ? wilt thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous ?
DARBY	Job	40	9	Hast thou an arm like God ? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him ?
DARBY	Job	40	10	Deck thyself now with glory and excellency , and clothe thyself with majesty and splendour .
DARBY	Job	40	11	Cast abroad the ragings of thine anger , and look on every one that is proud , and abase him :
DARBY	Job	40	12	Look on every one that is proud , bring him low , and tread down the wicked in their place :
DARBY	Job	40	13	Hide them in the dust together ; bind their faces in secret .
DARBY	Job	40	14	Then will I also praise thee , because thy right hand saveth thee .
DARBY	Job	40	15	See now the behemoth , which I made with thee : he eateth grass as an ox .
DARBY	Job	40	16	Behold now , his strength is in his loins , and his force is in the muscles of his belly .
DARBY	Job	40	17	He bendeth his tail like a cedar ; the sinews of his thighs are woven together .
DARBY	Job	40	18	His bones are tubes of bronze , his members are like bars of iron .
DARBY	Job	40	19	He is the chief of God 's ways : he that made him gave him his sword .
DARBY	Job	40	20	For the mountains bring him forth food , where all the beasts of the field play .
DARBY	Job	40	21	He lieth under lotus-bushes , in the covert of the reed and fen :
DARBY	Job	40	22	Lotus-bushes cover him with their shade ; the willows of the brook surround him .
DARBY	Job	40	23	Lo , the river overfloweth—he startleth not : he is confident though a Jordan break forth against his mouth .
DARBY	Job	40	24	Shall he be taken in front ? will they pierce through [ his ] nose in the trap ?
DARBY	Job	41	41	Wilt thou draw out the leviathan with the hook , and press down his tongue with a cord ?
DARBY	Job	41	2	Wilt thou put a rush-rope into his nose , and pierce his jaw with a spike ?
DARBY	Job	41	3	Will he make many supplications unto thee ? or will he speak softly unto thee ?
DARBY	Job	41	4	Will he make a covenant with thee ? wilt thou take him as a bondman for ever ?
DARBY	Job	41	5	Wilt thou play with him as with a bird , and wilt thou bind him for thy maidens ?
DARBY	Job	41	6	Shall partners make traffic of him , will they divide him among merchants ?
DARBY	Job	41	7	Wilt thou fill his skin with darts , and his head with fish-spears ?
DARBY	Job	41	8	Lay thy hand upon him ; remember the battle , —do no more !
DARBY	Job	41	9	Lo , hope as to him is belied : is not one cast down even at the sight of him ?
DARBY	Job	41	10	None is so bold as to stir him up ; and who is he that will stand before me ?
DARBY	Job	41	11	Who hath first given to me , that I should repay [ him ] ? [ Whatsoever is ] under the whole heaven is mine .
DARBY	Job	41	12	I will not be silent as to his parts , the story of his power , and the beauty of his structure .
DARBY	Job	41	13	Who can uncover the surface of his garment ? who can come within his double jaws ?
DARBY	Job	41	14	Who can open the doors of his face ? Round about his teeth is terror .
DARBY	Job	41	15	The rows of his shields are a pride , shut up together [ as with ] a close seal .
DARBY	Job	41	16	One is so near to another that no air can come between them ;
DARBY	Job	41	17	They are joined each to its fellow ; they stick together , and can not be sundered .
DARBY	Job	41	18	His sneezings flash light , and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning .
DARBY	Job	41	19	Out of his mouth go forth flames ; sparks of fire leap out :
DARBY	Job	41	20	Out of his nostrils goeth smoke , as out of a boiling pot and cauldron .
DARBY	Job	41	21	His breath kindleth coals , and a flame goeth out of his mouth .
DARBY	Job	41	22	In his neck lodgeth strength , and terror danceth before him .
DARBY	Job	41	23	The flakes of his flesh are joined together : they are fused upon him , they can not be moved .
DARBY	Job	41	24	His heart is firm as a stone , yea , firm as the nether [ millstone ] .
DARBY	Job	41	25	When he raiseth himself up , the mighty are afraid : they are beside themselves with consternation .
DARBY	Job	41	26	If any reach him with a sword , it can not hold ; neither spear , nor dart , nor harpoon .
DARBY	Job	41	27	He esteemeth iron as straw , bronze as rotten wood .
DARBY	Job	41	28	The arrow will not make him flee ; slingstones are turned with him into stubble .
DARBY	Job	41	29	Clubs are counted as stubble ; he laugheth at the shaking of a javelin .
DARBY	Job	41	30	His under parts are sharp potsherds : he spreadeth a threshing-sledge upon the mire .
DARBY	Job	41	31	He maketh the deep to boil like a pot ; he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment ;
DARBY	Job	41	32	He maketh the path to shine after him : one would think the deep to be hoary .
DARBY	Job	41	33	Upon earth there is not his like , who is made without fear .
DARBY	Job	41	34	He beholdeth all high things ; he is king over all the proud beasts .
DARBY	Job	42	42	And Job answered Jehovah and said ,
DARBY	Job	42	2	I know that thou canst do everything , and that thou canst be hindered in no thought of thine .
DARBY	Job	42	3	Who is he that obscureth counsel without knowledge ? therefore have I uttered what I did not understand ; things too wonderful for me , which I knew not .
DARBY	Job	42	4	Hear , I beseech thee , and I will speak : I will demand of thee , and inform me .
DARBY	Job	42	5	I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear , but now mine eye seeth thee :
DARBY	Job	42	6	Wherefore I abhor [ myself ] , and repent in dust and ashes .
DARBY	Job	42	7	And it came to pass after Jehovah had spoken these words to Job , that Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite , Mine anger is kindled against thee , and against thy two friends ; for ye have not spoken rightly of me , like my servant Job .
DARBY	Job	42	8	And now , take for yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams , and go to my servant Job , and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering ; and my servant Job shall pray for you , for him will I accept : lest I deal with you [ after your ] folly , for ye have not spoken of me rightly , like my servant Job .
DARBY	Job	42	9	Then Eliphaz the Temanite , and Bildad the Shuhite , and Zophar the Naamathite , went and did according as Jehovah had said unto them ; and Jehovah accepted Job .
DARBY	Job	42	10	And Jehovah turned the captivity of Job , when he had prayed for his friends ; and Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before .
DARBY	Job	42	11	And all his brethren , and all his sisters , and all they that had been of his acquaintance before , came to him , and they ate bread with him in his house , and they condoled with him , and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him ; and every one gave him a piece of money , and every one a golden ring .
DARBY	Job	42	12	And Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning ; and he had fourteen thousand sheep , and six thousand camels , and a thousand yoke of oxen , and a thousand she-asses .
DARBY	Job	42	13	And he had seven sons and three daughters .
DARBY	Job	42	14	And he called the name of the first , Jemimah ; and the name of the second , Keziah ; and the name of the third , Keren-happuch .
DARBY	Job	42	15	And in all the land were no women found [ so ] fair as the daughters of Job ; and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren .
DARBY	Job	42	16	And Job lived after this a hundred and forty years , and saw his sons , and his sons ' sons , four generations .
DARBY	Job	42	17	And Job died , old and full of days .
DARBY	Psalms	1	1	Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked , and standeth not in the way of sinners , and sitteth not in the seat of scorners ;
DARBY	Psalms	1	2	But his delight is in Jehovah 's law , and in his law doth he meditate day and night .
DARBY	Psalms	1	3	And he [ is ] as a tree planted by brooks of water , which giveth its fruit in its season , and whose leaf fadeth not ; and all that he doeth prospereth .
DARBY	Psalms	1	4	The wicked are not so ; but are as the chaff which the wind driveth away .
DARBY	Psalms	1	5	Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment , nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous .
DARBY	Psalms	1	6	For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous , but the way of the wicked shall perish . Bible Gateway Recommends NLT The Swindoll Study Bible Large Print Hardcover Retail : $ 59.99 Our Price : $ 44.99 Save : $ 15.00 (

DARBY	Psalms	2	2	The kings of the earth set themselves , and the princes plot together , against Jehovah and against his anointed :
DARBY	Psalms	2	3	Let us break their bonds asunder , and cast away their cords from us !
DARBY	Psalms	2	4	He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh , the Lord shall have them in derision .
DARBY	Psalms	2	5	Then will he speak to them in his anger , and in his fierce displeasure will he terrify them :
DARBY	Psalms	2	6	And * I * have anointed my king upon Zion , the hill of my holiness .
DARBY	Psalms	2	7	I will declare the decree : Jehovah hath said unto me , Thou art my Son ; * I * this day have begotten thee .
DARBY	Psalms	2	8	Ask of me , and I will give thee nations for an inheritance , and for thy possession the ends of the earth :
DARBY	Psalms	2	9	Thou shalt break them with a sceptre of iron , as a potter 's vessel thou shalt dash them in pieces .
DARBY	Psalms	2	10	And now , O kings , be ye wise , be admonished , ye judges of the earth .
DARBY	Psalms	2	11	Serve Jehovah with fear , and rejoice with trembling .
DARBY	Psalms	2	12	Kiss the Son , lest he be angry , and ye perish in the way , though his anger burn but a little . Blessed are all who have their trust in him .
DARBY	Psalms	3	3	But thou , Jehovah , art a shield about me ; my glory , and the lifter up of my head .
DARBY	Psalms	3	2	Many say of my soul , There is no salvation for him in God . Selah .
DARBY	Psalms	3	4	With my voice will I call to Jehovah , and he will answer me from the hill of his holiness . Selah .
DARBY	Psalms	3	5	I laid me down and slept ; I awaked , for Jehovah sustaineth me .

DARBY	Psalms	40	6	Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire : ears hast thou prepared me . Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not demanded ;
DARBY	Psalms	40	7	Then said I , Behold , I come , in the volume of the book it is written of me—
DARBY	Psalms	40	8	To do thy good pleasure , my God , is my delight , and thy law is within my heart .

DARBY	Psalms	44	2	Thou , by thy hand , didst dispossess the nations , but them thou didst plant ; thou didst afflict the peoples , but them didst thou cause to spread out .

DARBY	Psalms	44	15	All the day my confusion is before me , and the shame of my face hath covered me ,
DARBY	Psalms	44	16	Because of the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth ; by reason of the enemy and the avenger .
DARBY	Psalms	44	17	All this is come upon us ; yet have we not forgotten thee , neither have we dealt falsely against thy covenant :

DARBY	Psalms	73	18	Truly thou settest them in slippery places , thou castest them down in ruins .
DARBY	Psalms	73	19	How are they suddenly made desolate ! they pass away , consumed with terrors .
DARBY	Psalms	73	20	As a dream , when one awaketh , wilt thou , Lord , on arising despise their image .
DARBY	Psalms	73	21	When my heart was in a ferment , and I was pricked in my reins ,
DARBY	Psalms	73	22	Then I was brutish and knew nothing ; I was [ as ] a beast with thee .
DARBY	Psalms	73	23	Nevertheless I am continually with thee : thou hast holden my right hand ;
DARBY	Psalms	73	24	Thou wilt guide me by thy counsel , and after the glory , thou wilt receive me .
DARBY	Psalms	73	25	Whom have I in the heavens ? and there is none upon earth I desire beside thee .
DARBY	Psalms	73	26	My flesh and my heart faileth : God is the rock of my heart and my portion for ever .
DARBY	Psalms	73	27	For behold , they that are far from thee shall perish ; thou destroyest every one that goeth a whoring from thee .
DARBY	Psalms	73	28	But as for me , it is good for me to draw near to God : I have put my trust in the Lord Jehovah , that I may declare all thy works .
DARBY	Psalms	74	74	Why , O God , hast thou cast off for ever ? [ why ] doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture ?
DARBY	Psalms	74	2	Remember thine assembly , which thou hast purchased of old , which thou hast redeemed [ to be ] the portion of thine inheritance , this mount Zion , wherein thou hast dwelt .
DARBY	Psalms	74	3	Lift up thy steps unto the perpetual desolations : everything in the sanctuary hath the enemy destroyed .
DARBY	Psalms	74	4	Thine adversaries roar in the midst of thy place of assembly ; they set up their signs [ for ] signs .
DARBY	Psalms	74	5	[ A man ] was known as he could lift up axes in the thicket of trees ;
DARBY	Psalms	74	6	And now they break down its carved work altogether , with hatchets and hammers .
DARBY	Psalms	74	7	They have set on fire thy sanctuary , they have profaned the habitation of thy name to the ground .
DARBY	Psalms	74	8	They said in their heart , Let us destroy them together : they have burned up all God 's places of assembly in the land .
DARBY	Psalms	74	9	We see not our signs ; there is no more any prophet , neither is there among us any that knoweth how long .
DARBY	Psalms	74	10	How long , O God , shall the adversary reproach ? Shall the enemy contemn thy name for ever ?
DARBY	Psalms	74	11	Why withdrawest thou thy hand , and thy right hand ? [ pluck it ] out of thy bosom : consume [ them ] .
DARBY	Psalms	74	12	But God is my king of old , accomplishing deliverances in the midst of the earth .
DARBY	Psalms	74	13	* Thou * didst divide the sea by thy strength ; thou didst break the heads of the monsters on the waters :
DARBY	Psalms	74	14	* Thou * didst break in pieces the heads of leviathan , thou gavest him to be meat to those that people the desert .
DARBY	Psalms	74	15	* Thou * didst cleave fountain and torrent , * thou * driedst up ever-flowing rivers .
DARBY	Psalms	74	16	The day is thine , the night also is thine ; * thou * hast prepared the moon and the sun :
DARBY	Psalms	74	17	* Thou * hast set all the borders of the earth ; summer and winter— * thou * didst form them .
DARBY	Psalms	74	18	Remember this , that an enemy hath reproached Jehovah , and a foolish people have contemned thy name .
DARBY	Psalms	74	19	Give not up the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast ; forget not the troop of thine afflicted for ever .
DARBY	Psalms	74	20	Have respect unto the covenant ; for the dark places of the earth are full of the dwellings of violence .
DARBY	Psalms	74	21	Oh let not the oppressed one return ashamed ; let the afflicted and needy praise thy name .
DARBY	Psalms	74	22	Rise up , O God , plead thine own cause : remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day ;
DARBY	Psalms	74	23	Forget not the voice of thine adversaries : the tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually .
DARBY	Psalms	75	75	Unto thee we give thanks , O God , we give thanks ; and thy name is near : thy marvellous works declare it .
DARBY	Psalms	75	2	When I shall receive the assembly , I will judge with equity .
DARBY	Psalms	75	3	The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved : I have established its pillars . Selah .
DARBY	Psalms	75	4	I said unto the boastful , Boast not ; and to the wicked , Lift not up the horn :
DARBY	Psalms	75	5	Lift not up your horn on high ; speak not arrogantly with a [ stiff ] neck .
DARBY	Psalms	75	6	For not from the east nor from the west , nor yet from the south doth exaltation [ come ] :
DARBY	Psalms	75	7	For God is the judge ; he putteth down one and exalteth another .
DARBY	Psalms	75	8	For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup , and it foameth with wine , it is full of mixture ; and he poureth out of the same ; yea , the dregs thereof shall all the wicked of the earth drain off , [ and ] drink .
DARBY	Psalms	75	9	But as for me , I will declare for ever ; I will sing psalms to the God of Jacob .
DARBY	Psalms	75	10	And all the horns of the wicked will I cut off ; [ but ] the horns of the righteous shall be exalted .
DARBY	Psalms	76	76	In Judah is God known , his name is great in Israel ;
DARBY	Psalms	76	2	And in Salem is his tent , and his dwelling-place in Zion .
DARBY	Psalms	76	3	There broke he the flashings of the bow , shield and sword and battle . Selah .
DARBY	Psalms	76	4	More glorious art thou , more excellent , than the mountains of prey .
DARBY	Psalms	76	5	The stout-hearted are made a spoil , they have slept their sleep ; and none of the men of might have found their hands .
DARBY	Psalms	76	6	At thy rebuke , O God of Jacob , both chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep .
DARBY	Psalms	76	7	Thou , thou art to be feared , and who can stand before thee when once thou art angry ?
DARBY	Psalms	76	8	Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from the heavens ; the earth feared , and was still ,
DARBY	Psalms	76	9	When God rose up to judgment , to save all the meek of the earth . Selah .
DARBY	Psalms	76	10	For the fury of man shall praise thee ; the remainder of fury wilt thou gird on thyself .
DARBY	Psalms	76	11	Vow and pay unto Jehovah your God : let all that are round about him bring presents unto him that is to be feared .
DARBY	Psalms	76	12	He cutteth off the spirit of princes ; [ he ] is terrible to the kings of the earth .
DARBY	Psalms	77	77	My voice is unto God , and I will cry ; my voice is unto God , and he will give ear unto me .
DARBY	Psalms	77	2	In the day of my trouble , I sought the Lord : my hand was stretched out in the night , and slacked not ; my soul refused to be comforted .
DARBY	Psalms	77	3	I remembered God , and I moaned ; I complained , and my spirit was overwhelmed . Selah .
DARBY	Psalms	77	4	Thou holdest open mine eyelids ; I am full of disquiet and can not speak .
DARBY	Psalms	77	5	I consider the days of old , the years of ancient times .
DARBY	Psalms	77	6	I remember my song in the night ; I muse in mine own heart , and my spirit maketh diligent search .
DARBY	Psalms	77	7	Will the Lord cast off for ever ? and will he be favourable no more ?
DARBY	Psalms	77	8	Hath his loving-kindness ceased for ever ? hath [ his ] word come to an end from generation to generation ?
DARBY	Psalms	77	9	Hath God forgotten to be gracious ? or hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies ? Selah .
DARBY	Psalms	77	10	Then said I , This is my weakness : —the years of the right hand of the Most High
DARBY	Psalms	77	11	Will I remember , —the works of Jah ; for I will remember thy wonders of old ,
DARBY	Psalms	77	12	And I will meditate upon all thy work , and muse upon thy doings .
DARBY	Psalms	77	13	O God , thy way is in the sanctuary : who is so great a god as God ?
DARBY	Psalms	77	14	Thou art the God that doest wonders ; thou hast declared thy strength among the peoples .
DARBY	Psalms	77	15	Thou hast with [ thine ] arm redeemed thy people , the sons of Jacob and Joseph . Selah .
DARBY	Psalms	77	16	The waters saw thee , O God , the waters saw thee ; they trembled , yea , the depths were troubled :
DARBY	Psalms	77	17	The thick clouds poured out water ; the skies sent out a sound , yea , thine arrows went abroad :
DARBY	Psalms	77	18	The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind , lightnings lit up the world ; the earth was troubled and it quaked .
DARBY	Psalms	77	19	Thy way is in the sea , and thy paths are in the great waters ; and thy footsteps are not known .
DARBY	Psalms	77	20	Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron .
DARBY	Psalms	78	78	Give ear , O my people , to my law ; incline your ears to the words of my mouth .
DARBY	Psalms	78	2	I will open my mouth in a parable ; I will utter riddles from of old ,
DARBY	Psalms	78	3	Which we have heard and known , and our fathers have told us :
DARBY	Psalms	78	4	We will not hide [ them ] from their sons , shewing forth to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah , and his strength , and his marvellous works which he hath done .
DARBY	Psalms	78	5	For he established a testimony in Jacob , and appointed a law in Israel , which he commanded our fathers , that they should make them known to their children ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	6	That the generation to come might know [ them ] , the children that should be born ; that they might rise up and tell [ them ] to their children ,
DARBY	Psalms	78	7	And that they might set their hope in God , and not forget the works of God , but observe his commandments ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	8	And might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation , a generation that prepared not their heart , and whose spirit was not stedfast with God .
DARBY	Psalms	78	9	The sons of Ephraim , armed bowmen , turned back in the day of battle .
DARBY	Psalms	78	10	They kept not the covenant of God , and refused to walk in his law ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	11	And forgot his doings , and his marvellous works which he had shewn them .
DARBY	Psalms	78	12	In the sight of their fathers had he done wonders , in the land of Egypt , the field of Zoan .
DARBY	Psalms	78	13	He clave the sea , and caused them to pass through ; and made the waters to stand as a heap ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	14	And he led them with a cloud in the daytime , and all the night with the light of fire .
DARBY	Psalms	78	15	He clave rocks in the wilderness , and gave [ them ] drink as out of the depths , abundantly ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	16	And he brought streams out of the rock , and caused waters to run down like rivers .
DARBY	Psalms	78	17	Yet they still went on sinning against him , provoking the Most High in the desert ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	18	And they tempted God in their heart , by asking meat for their lust ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	19	And they spoke against God : they said , Is God able to prepare a table in the wilderness ?
DARBY	Psalms	78	20	Behold , he smote the rock , and waters gushed out , and streams overflowed ; is he able to give bread also , or provide flesh for his people ?
DARBY	Psalms	78	21	Therefore Jehovah heard , and was wroth ; and fire was kindled against Jacob , and anger also went up against Israel :
DARBY	Psalms	78	22	Because they believed not in God , and confided not in his salvation ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	23	Though he had commanded the clouds from above , and had opened the doors of the heavens ,
DARBY	Psalms	78	24	And had rained down manna upon them to eat , and had given them the corn of the heavens .
DARBY	Psalms	78	25	Man did eat the bread of the mighty ; he sent them provision to the full .
DARBY	Psalms	78	26	He caused the east wind to rise in the heavens , and by his strength he brought the south wind ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	27	And he rained flesh upon them as dust , and feathered fowl as the sand of the seas ,
DARBY	Psalms	78	28	And he let it fall in the midst of their camp , round about their habitations :
DARBY	Psalms	78	29	And they did eat , and were well filled ; for that they lusted after , he brought to them .
DARBY	Psalms	78	30	They were not alienated from their lust , their meat was yet in their mouths ,
DARBY	Psalms	78	31	When the anger of God went up against them ; and he slew the fattest of them , and smote down the chosen men of Israel .
DARBY	Psalms	78	32	For all this , they sinned still , and believed not in his marvellous works ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	33	And he consumed their days in vanity , and their years in terror .
DARBY	Psalms	78	34	When he slew them , then they sought him , and returned and sought early after God ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	35	And they remembered that God was their rock , and God , the Most High , their redeemer .
DARBY	Psalms	78	36	But they flattered him with their mouth , and lied unto him with their tongue ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	37	For their heart was not firm toward him , neither were they stedfast in his covenant .
DARBY	Psalms	78	38	But he was merciful : he forgave the iniquity , and destroyed [ them ] not ; but many a time turned he his anger away , and did not stir up all his fury :
DARBY	Psalms	78	39	And he remembered that they were flesh , a breath that passeth away and cometh not again .
DARBY	Psalms	78	40	How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness , and grieve him in the desert !
DARBY	Psalms	78	41	And they turned again and tempted God , and grieved the Holy One of Israel .
DARBY	Psalms	78	42	They remembered not his hand , the day when he delivered them from the oppressor ,
DARBY	Psalms	78	43	How he set his signs in Egypt , and his miracles in the field of Zoan ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	44	And turned their rivers into blood , and their streams , that they could not drink ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	45	He sent dog-flies among them , which devoured them , and frogs , which destroyed them ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	46	And he gave their increase unto the caterpillar , and their labour unto the locust ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	47	He killed their vines with hail , and their sycamore trees with hail-stones ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	48	And he delivered up their cattle to the hail , and their flocks to thunderbolts .
DARBY	Psalms	78	49	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger , wrath , and indignation , and distress , —a mission of angels of woes .
DARBY	Psalms	78	50	He made a way for his anger ; he spared not their soul from death , but gave their life over to the pestilence ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	51	And he smote all the firstborn in Egypt , the first-fruits of their vigour in the tents of Ham .
DARBY	Psalms	78	52	And he made his own people to go forth like sheep , and guided them in the wilderness like a flock ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	53	And he led them safely , so that they were without fear ; and the sea covered their enemies .
DARBY	Psalms	78	54	And he brought them to his holy border , this mountain , which his right hand purchased ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	55	And he drove out the nations before them , and allotted them for an inheritance by line , and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents .
DARBY	Psalms	78	56	But they tempted and provoked God , the Most High , and kept not his testimonies ,
DARBY	Psalms	78	57	And they drew back and dealt treacherously like their fathers : they turned like a deceitful bow .
DARBY	Psalms	78	58	And they provoked him to anger with their high places , and moved him to jealousy with their graven images .
DARBY	Psalms	78	59	God heard , and was wroth , and greatly abhorred Israel :
DARBY	Psalms	78	60	And he forsook the tabernacle at Shiloh , the tent where he had dwelt among men ,
DARBY	Psalms	78	61	And gave his strength into captivity , and his glory into the hand of the oppressor ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	62	And delivered up his people unto the sword , and was very wroth with his inheritance :
DARBY	Psalms	78	63	The fire consumed their young men , and their maidens were not praised in [ nuptial ] song ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	64	Their priests fell by the sword , and their widows made no lamentation .
DARBY	Psalms	78	65	Then the Lord awoke as one out of sleep , like a mighty man that shouteth aloud by reason of wine ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	66	And he smote his adversaries in the hinder part , and put them to everlasting reproach .
DARBY	Psalms	78	67	And he rejected the tent of Joseph , and chose not the tribe of Ephraim ,
DARBY	Psalms	78	68	But chose the tribe of Judah , the mount Zion which he loved ;
DARBY	Psalms	78	69	And he built his sanctuary like the heights , like the earth which he hath founded for ever .
DARBY	Psalms	78	70	And he chose David his servant , and took him from the sheepfolds :
DARBY	Psalms	78	71	From following the suckling-ewes , he brought him to feed Jacob his people , and Israel his inheritance .
DARBY	Psalms	78	72	And he fed them according to the integrity of his heart , and led them by the skilfulness of his hands .
DARBY	Psalms	79	79	O God , the nations are come into thine inheritance : thy holy temple have they defiled ; they have laid Jerusalem in heaps .
DARBY	Psalms	79	2	The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowl of the heavens , the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth :
DARBY	Psalms	79	3	Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem , and there was none to bury [ them ] .
DARBY	Psalms	79	4	We are become a reproach to our neighbours , a mockery and a derision to them that are round about us .
DARBY	Psalms	79	5	How long , O Jehovah ? wilt thou be angry for ever ? Shall thy jealousy burn like fire ?
DARBY	Psalms	79	6	Pour out thy fury upon the nations that have not known thee , and upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name :
DARBY	Psalms	79	7	For they have devoured Jacob , and laid waste his habitation .
DARBY	Psalms	79	8	Remember not against us the iniquities of [ our ] forefathers ; let thy tender mercies speedily come to meet us : for we are brought very low .
DARBY	Psalms	79	9	Help us , O God of our salvation , because of the glory of thy name ; and deliver us , and forgive our sins , for thy name 's sake .
DARBY	Psalms	79	10	Wherefore should the nations say , Where is their God ? Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants that is shed be known among the nations in our sight .
DARBY	Psalms	79	11	Let the groaning of the prisoner come before thee ; according to the greatness of thine arm , preserve those that are appointed to die ;
DARBY	Psalms	79	12	And render unto our neighbours , sevenfold into their bosom , their reproach , wherewith they have reproached thee , O Lord .
DARBY	Psalms	79	13	And we , thy people and the sheep of thy pasture , will give thanks unto thee for ever ; we will shew forth thy praise from generation to generation .
DARBY	Psalms	80	80	Give ear , O Shepherd of Israel , thou that leadest Joseph like a flock ; thou that sittest [ between ] the cherubim , shine forth .
DARBY	Psalms	80	2	Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh , stir up thy strength , and come to our deliverance .
DARBY	Psalms	80	3	O God , restore us ; and cause thy face to shine , and we shall be saved .
DARBY	Psalms	80	4	Jehovah , God of hosts , how long will thine anger smoke against the prayer of thy people ?
DARBY	Psalms	80	5	Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears , and given them tears to drink in large measure :
DARBY	Psalms	80	6	Thou hast made us a strife unto our neighbours , and our enemies mock among themselves .
DARBY	Psalms	80	7	Restore us , O God of hosts ; and cause thy face to shine , and we shall be saved .
DARBY	Psalms	80	8	Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt ; thou didst cast out the nations , and plant it :
DARBY	Psalms	80	9	Thou preparedst space before it , and it took deep root , and filled the land ;
DARBY	Psalms	80	10	The mountains were covered with its shadow , and the branches thereof were [ like ] cedars of God ;
DARBY	Psalms	80	11	It sent out its boughs unto the sea , and its shoots unto the river .
DARBY	Psalms	80	12	Why hast thou broken down its fences , so that all who pass by the way do pluck it ?
DARBY	Psalms	80	13	The boar out of the forest doth waste it , and the beast of the field doth feed off it .
DARBY	Psalms	80	14	O God of hosts , return , we beseech thee ; look down from the heavens , and behold , and visit this vine ;
DARBY	Psalms	80	15	Even the stock which thy right hand hath planted , and the young plant thou madest strong for thyself .
DARBY	Psalms	80	16	It is burned with fire , it is cut down ; they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance .
DARBY	Psalms	80	17	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand , upon the son of man whom thou hast made strong for thyself .
DARBY	Psalms	80	18	So will we not go back from thee . Revive us , and we will call upon thy name .
DARBY	Psalms	80	19	Restore us , O Jehovah , God of hosts ; cause thy face to shine , and we shall be saved .
DARBY	Psalms	81	81	Sing ye joyously unto God our strength , shout aloud unto the God of Jacob ;
DARBY	Psalms	81	2	Raise a song , and sound the tambour , the pleasant harp with the lute .
DARBY	Psalms	81	3	Blow the trumpet at the new moon , at the set time , on our feast day :
DARBY	Psalms	81	4	For this is a statute for Israel , an ordinance of the God of Jacob ;
DARBY	Psalms	81	5	He ordained it in Joseph [ for ] a testimony , when he went forth over the land of Egypt , [ where ] I heard a language that I knew not .
DARBY	Psalms	81	6	I removed his shoulder from the burden ; his hands were freed from the basket .
DARBY	Psalms	81	7	Thou calledst in trouble , and I delivered thee ; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder ; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah . Selah .
DARBY	Psalms	81	8	Hear , my people , and I will testify unto thee ; O Israel , if thou wouldest hearken unto me !
DARBY	Psalms	81	9	There shall no strange god be in thee , neither shalt thou worship any foreign god .
DARBY	Psalms	81	10	I am Jehovah thy God , that brought thee up out of the land of Egypt : open thy mouth wide , and I will fill it .
DARBY	Psalms	81	11	But my people hearkened not to my voice , and Israel would none of me .
DARBY	Psalms	81	12	So I gave them up unto their own hearts ' stubbornness : they walked after their own counsels .
DARBY	Psalms	81	13	Oh that my people had hearkened unto me , that Israel had walked in my ways !
DARBY	Psalms	81	14	I would soon have subdued their enemies , and turned my hand against their adversaries .
DARBY	Psalms	81	15	The haters of Jehovah would have come cringing unto him ; but their time would have been for ever .
DARBY	Psalms	81	16	And he would have fed them with the finest of wheat ; yea , with honey out of the rock would I have satisfied thee .
DARBY	Psalms	82	82	God standeth in the assembly of God , he judgeth among the gods .
DARBY	Psalms	82	2	How long will ye judge unrighteously , and accept the person of the wicked ? Selah .
DARBY	Psalms	82	3	Judge the poor and the fatherless , do justice to the afflicted and the destitute ;
DARBY	Psalms	82	4	Rescue the poor and needy , deliver them out of the hand of the wicked .
DARBY	Psalms	82	5	They know not , neither do they understand ; they walk on in darkness : all the foundations of the earth are moved .
DARBY	Psalms	82	6	I have said , Ye are gods , and all of you are children of the Most High ;
DARBY	Psalms	82	7	But ye shall die like men , and fall like one of the princes .
DARBY	Psalms	82	8	Arise , O God , judge the earth ; for * thou * shalt inherit all the nations . Bible Gateway Recommends NLT Life Application Study Bible , Third Edition -- hardcover , red letter Retail : $ 49.99 Our Price : $ 36.99 Save : $ 13.00 (

DARBY	Psalms	83	83	O God , keep not silence ; hold not thy peace , and be not still , O God :
DARBY	Psalms	83	2	For behold , thine enemies make a tumult ; and they that hate thee lift up the head .
DARBY	Psalms	83	3	They take crafty counsel against thy people , and consult against thy hidden ones :
DARBY	Psalms	83	4	They say , Come , and let us cut them off from being a nation , and let the name of Israel be mentioned no more .
DARBY	Psalms	83	5	For they have consulted together with one heart : they have made an alliance together against thee .
DARBY	Psalms	83	6	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites , Moab and the Hagarites ;
DARBY	Psalms	83	7	Gebal , and Ammon , and Amalek ; Philistia , with the inhabitants of Tyre ;
DARBY	Psalms	83	8	Asshur also is joined with them : they are an arm to the sons of Lot . Selah .
DARBY	Psalms	83	9	Do unto them as to Midian ; as to Sisera , as to Jabin , at the torrent of Kishon :
DARBY	Psalms	83	10	Who were destroyed at Endor ; they became as dung for the ground .
DARBY	Psalms	83	11	Make their nobles as Oreb and as Zeeb ; and all their chiefs as Zebah and as Zalmunna .
DARBY	Psalms	83	12	For they have said , Let us take to ourselves God 's dwelling-places in possession .
DARBY	Psalms	83	13	O my God , make them like a whirling thing , like stubble before the wind .
DARBY	Psalms	83	14	As fire burneth a forest , and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire ,
DARBY	Psalms	83	15	So pursue them with thy tempest , and terrify them with thy whirlwind .
DARBY	Psalms	83	16	Fill their faces with shame , that they may seek thy name , O Jehovah .
DARBY	Psalms	83	17	Let them be put to shame and be dismayed for ever , and let them be confounded and perish :
DARBY	Psalms	83	18	That they may know that thou alone , whose name is Jehovah , art the Most High over all the earth .
DARBY	Psalms	84	84	How amiable are thy tabernacles , O Jehovah of hosts !
DARBY	Psalms	84	2	My soul longeth , yea , even fainteth for the courts of Jehovah ; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God .
DARBY	Psalms	84	3	Yea , the sparrow hath found a house , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she layeth her young , thine altars , O Jehovah of hosts , my King and my God .
DARBY	Psalms	84	4	Blessed are they that dwell in thy house : they will be constantly praising thee . Selah .
DARBY	Psalms	84	5	Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee , —they , in whose heart are the highways .
DARBY	Psalms	84	6	Passing through the valley of Baca , they make it a well-spring ; yea , the early rain covereth it with blessings .
DARBY	Psalms	84	7	They go from strength to strength : [ each one ] will appear before God in Zion .

DARBY	Psalms	104	4	Who maketh his angels spirits ; his ministers a flame of fire .
DARBY	Psalms	104	5	He laid the earth upon its foundations : it shall not be removed for ever .
DARBY	Psalms	104	6	Thou hadst covered it with the deep , as with a vesture ; the waters stood above the mountains :

DARBY	Psalms	104	19	He made the moon for seasons : the sun knoweth its going down .
DARBY	Psalms	104	20	Thou makest darkness , and it is night , wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth :
DARBY	Psalms	104	21	The young lions roar after the prey , and to seek their food from God .
DARBY	Psalms	104	22	The sun ariseth , they retreat , and lay them down in their dens .
DARBY	Psalms	104	23	Man goeth forth unto his work , and to his labour until the evening .
DARBY	Psalms	104	24	How manifold are thy works , O Jehovah ! in wisdom hast thou made them all : the earth is full of thy riches .
DARBY	Psalms	104	25	Yonder is the great and wide sea : therein are moving things innumerable , living creatures small and great .
DARBY	Psalms	104	26	There go the ships ; [ there ] that leviathan , which thou hast formed to play therein .

DARBY	Psalms	105	15	[ Saying , ] Touch not mine anointed ones , and do my prophets no harm .
DARBY	Psalms	105	16	And he called for a famine upon the land ; he broke the whole staff of bread .
DARBY	Psalms	105	17	He sent a man before them : Joseph was sold for a bondman .
DARBY	Psalms	105	18	They afflicted his feet with fetters ; his soul came into irons ;
DARBY	Psalms	105	19	Until the time when what he said came about : the word of Jehovah tried him .
DARBY	Psalms	105	20	The king sent and loosed him—the ruler of peoples—and let him go free .

DARBY	Psalms	105	27	They set his signs among them , and miracles in the land of Ham .
DARBY	Psalms	105	28	He sent darkness , and made it dark ; and they rebelled not against his word .
DARBY	Psalms	105	29	He turned their waters into blood , and caused their fish to die .
DARBY	Psalms	105	30	Their land swarmed with frogs , —in the chambers of their kings .
DARBY	Psalms	105	31	He spoke , and there came dog-flies , [ and ] gnats in all their borders .
DARBY	Psalms	105	32	He gave them hail for rain , [ and ] flaming fire in their land ;
DARBY	Psalms	105	33	And he smote their vines and their fig-trees , and broke the trees of their borders .

DARBY	Psalms	105	36	And he smote every firstborn in their land , the firstfruits of all their vigour .

DARBY	Psalms	106	6	We have sinned with our fathers , we have committed iniquity , we have done wickedly .
DARBY	Psalms	106	7	Our fathers in Egypt considered not thy wondrous works ; they remembered not the multitude of thy loving-kindnesses ; but they rebelled at the sea , at the Red Sea .
DARBY	Psalms	106	8	Yet he saved them for his name 's sake , that he might make known his might .
DARBY	Psalms	106	9	And he rebuked the Red Sea , and it dried up ; and he led them through the deeps as through a wilderness .
DARBY	Psalms	106	10	And he saved them from the hand of him that hated [ them ] , and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy .
DARBY	Psalms	106	11	And the waters covered their oppressors : there was not one of them left .
DARBY	Psalms	106	12	Then believed they his words ; they sang his praise .
DARBY	Psalms	106	13	They soon forgot his works ; they waited not for his counsel :
DARBY	Psalms	106	14	And they lusted exceedingly in the wilderness , and tempted God in the desert .
DARBY	Psalms	106	15	Then he gave them their request , but sent leanness into their soul .
DARBY	Psalms	106	16	And they envied Moses in the camp , [ and ] Aaron , the saint of Jehovah .
DARBY	Psalms	106	17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan , and covered the company of Abiram ;
DARBY	Psalms	106	18	And fire was kindled in their company ; a flame burned up the wicked .
DARBY	Psalms	106	19	They made a calf in Horeb , and did homage to a molten image ;
DARBY	Psalms	106	20	And they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass .
DARBY	Psalms	106	21	They forgot God their Saviour , who had done great things in Egypt ,
DARBY	Psalms	106	22	Wondrous works in the land of Ham , terrible things by the Red Sea .
DARBY	Psalms	106	23	And he said that he would destroy them , had not Moses , his chosen , stood before him in the breach , to turn away his fury , lest he should destroy [ them ] .
DARBY	Psalms	106	24	And they despised the pleasant land ; they believed not his word ,
DARBY	Psalms	106	25	But murmured in their tents : they hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah .
DARBY	Psalms	106	26	And he lifted up his hand to them , that he would make them fall in the wilderness ;
DARBY	Psalms	106	27	And that he would make their seed fall among the nations , and disperse them through the countries .
DARBY	Psalms	106	28	And they joined themselves unto Baal-Peor , and ate the sacrifices of the dead ;
DARBY	Psalms	106	29	And they provoked [ him ] to anger with their doings ; and a plague broke out among them .
DARBY	Psalms	106	30	Then stood up Phinehas and executed judgment , and the plague was stayed ;
DARBY	Psalms	106	31	And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness , from generation to generation , for evermore .
DARBY	Psalms	106	32	And they moved him to wrath at the waters of Meribah , and it went ill with Moses on their account ;
DARBY	Psalms	106	33	For they provoked his spirit , so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips .
DARBY	Psalms	106	34	They did not destroy the peoples , as Jehovah commanded them ;
DARBY	Psalms	106	35	But they mingled with the nations , and learned their works ;
DARBY	Psalms	106	36	And they served their idols ; and they were a snare unto them :
DARBY	Psalms	106	37	And they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons ,
DARBY	Psalms	106	38	And shed innocent blood , the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan ; and the land was polluted with blood .
DARBY	Psalms	106	39	And they were defiled with their works , and went a-whoring in their doings .
DARBY	Psalms	106	40	Then was the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people , and he abhorred his inheritance ;
DARBY	Psalms	106	41	And he gave them into the hand of the nations ; and they that hated them ruled over them :
DARBY	Psalms	106	42	And their enemies oppressed them , and they were brought into subjection under their hand .
DARBY	Psalms	106	43	Often did he deliver them ; but as for them they provoked [ him ] by their counsel , and they were brought low by their iniquity .
DARBY	Psalms	106	44	But he regarded their distress , when he heard their cry ;
DARBY	Psalms	106	45	And he remembered for them his covenant , and repented according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses ;
DARBY	Psalms	106	46	And he caused them to find compassion of all those that had carried them captives .
DARBY	Psalms	106	47	Save us , Jehovah our God , and gather us from among the nations , to give thanks unto thy holy name , [ and ] to triumph in thy praise .
DARBY	Psalms	106	48	Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel , from eternity and to eternity ! And let all the people say , Amen ! Hallelujah !
DARBY	Psalms	107	107	Give ye thanks unto Jehovah ; for he is good ; for his loving-kindness [ endureth ] for ever .
DARBY	Psalms	107	2	Let the redeemed of Jehovah say so , whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the oppressor ,
DARBY	Psalms	107	3	And gathered out of the countries , from the east and from the west , from the north and from the sea .
DARBY	Psalms	107	4	They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way , they found no city of habitation ;
DARBY	Psalms	107	5	Hungry and thirsty , their soul fainted in them :
DARBY	Psalms	107	6	Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble , [ and ] he delivered them out of their distresses ,
DARBY	Psalms	107	7	And he led them forth by a right way , that they might go to a city of habitation .
DARBY	Psalms	107	8	Let them give thanks unto Jehovah for his loving-kindness , and for his wondrous works to the children of men ;
DARBY	Psalms	107	9	For he hath satisfied the longing soul and filled the hungry soul with good .
DARBY	Psalms	107	10	Such as inhabit darkness and the shadow of death , bound in affliction and iron ,
DARBY	Psalms	107	11	Because they had rebelled against the words of God , and had despised the counsel of the Most High ; …
DARBY	Psalms	107	12	And he bowed down their heart with labour ; they stumbled , and there was none to help :
DARBY	Psalms	107	13	Then they cried unto Jehovah in their trouble , [ and ] he saved them out of their distresses ;
DARBY	Psalms	107	14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death , and broke their bands in sunder .
DARBY	Psalms	107	15	Let them give thanks unto Jehovah for his loving-kindness , and for his wondrous works to the children of men ;
DARBY	Psalms	107	16	For he hath broken the gates of bronze , and cut asunder the bars of iron .
DARBY	Psalms	107	17	Fools , because of their way of transgression , and because of their iniquities , are afflicted ;
DARBY	Psalms	107	18	Their soul abhorreth all manner of food , and they draw near unto the gates of death :
DARBY	Psalms	107	19	Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble , [ and ] he saveth them out of their distresses ;
DARBY	Psalms	107	20	He sendeth his word , and healeth them , and delivereth them from their destructions .
DARBY	Psalms	107	21	Let them give thanks unto Jehovah for his loving-kindness , and for his wondrous works to the children of men ,
DARBY	Psalms	107	22	And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving , and declare his works in joyful song .
DARBY	Psalms	107	23	They that go down to the sea in ships , that do business in great waters ,
DARBY	Psalms	107	24	These see the works of Jehovah , and his wonders in the deep .
DARBY	Psalms	107	25	For he speaketh , and raiseth the stormy wind , which lifteth up the waves thereof :
DARBY	Psalms	107	26	They mount up to the heavens , they go down to the depths ; their soul is melted because of trouble ;
DARBY	Psalms	107	27	They reel to and fro , and stagger like a drunken man , and they are at their wits ' end :
DARBY	Psalms	107	28	Then they cry unto Jehovah in their trouble , and he bringeth them out of their distresses ;

DARBY	Proverbs	1	1	Proverbs of Solomon , son of David , king of Israel :
DARBY	Proverbs	1	2	to know wisdom and instruction ; to discern the words of understanding ;
DARBY	Proverbs	1	3	to receive the instruction of wisdom , righteousness and judgment , and equity ;
DARBY	Proverbs	1	4	to give prudence to the simple , to the young man knowledge and discretion .
DARBY	Proverbs	1	5	He that is wise will hear , and will increase learning ; and the intelligent will gain wise counsels :
DARBY	Proverbs	1	6	to understand a proverb and an allegory , the words of the wise and their enigmas .
DARBY	Proverbs	1	7	The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge : fools despise wisdom and instruction .
DARBY	Proverbs	1	8	Hear , my son , the instruction of thy father , and forsake not the teaching of thy mother ;
DARBY	Proverbs	1	9	for they shall be a garland of grace unto thy head , and chains about thy neck .
DARBY	Proverbs	1	10	My son , if sinners entice thee , consent not .
DARBY	Proverbs	1	11	If they say , Come with us , let us lay wait for blood , let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause ;
DARBY	Proverbs	1	12	let us swallow them up alive as Sheol , and whole , as those that go down into the pit ;
DARBY	Proverbs	1	13	we shall find all precious substance , we shall fill our houses with spoil :
DARBY	Proverbs	1	14	cast in thy lot among us ; we will all have one purse :
DARBY	Proverbs	1	15	—my son , walk not in the way with them , keep back thy foot from their path ;
DARBY	Proverbs	1	16	for their feet run to evil , and they make haste to shed blood .
DARBY	Proverbs	1	17	For in vain the net is spread in the sight of anything which hath wings .
DARBY	Proverbs	1	18	And these lay wait for their own blood ; they lurk secretly for their own lives .
DARBY	Proverbs	1	19	So are the paths of every one that is greedy of gain : it taketh away the life of its possessors .
DARBY	Proverbs	1	20	Wisdom crieth without ; she raiseth her voice in the broadways ;
DARBY	Proverbs	1	21	she calleth in the chief [ place ] of concourse , in the entry of the gates ; in the city she uttereth her words :
DARBY	Proverbs	1	22	How long , simple ones , will ye love simpleness , and scorners take pleasure in their scorning , and the foolish hate knowledge ?
DARBY	Proverbs	1	23	Turn you at my reproof : behold , I will pour forth my spirit unto you , I will make known to you my words .
DARBY	Proverbs	1	24	Because I have called , and ye refused ; I have stretched out my hand , and no one regarded ;
DARBY	Proverbs	1	25	and ye have rejected all my counsel , and would none of my reproof :
DARBY	Proverbs	1	26	I also will laugh in your calamity , I will mock when your fear cometh ;
DARBY	Proverbs	1	27	when your fear cometh as sudden destruction , and your calamity cometh as a whirlwind ; when distress and anguish come upon you :
DARBY	Proverbs	1	28	—then will they call upon me , but I will not answer ; they will seek me early , and shall not find me .
DARBY	Proverbs	1	29	Because they hated knowledge , and did not choose the fear of Jehovah ;
DARBY	Proverbs	1	30	they would none of my counsel , they despised all my reproof :
DARBY	Proverbs	1	31	therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their way , and be filled with their own devices .
DARBY	Proverbs	1	32	For the turning away of the simple shall slay them , and the prosperity of the foolish shall cause them to perish .
DARBY	Proverbs	1	33	But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely , and shall be at rest from fear of evil .
DARBY	Proverbs	2	2	so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom [ and ] thou apply thy heart to understanding ;
DARBY	Proverbs	2	3	yea , if thou criest after discernment [ and ] liftest up thy voice to understanding ;
DARBY	Proverbs	2	4	if thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for hidden treasures :
DARBY	Proverbs	2	5	then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah , and find the knowledge of God .
DARBY	Proverbs	2	6	For Jehovah giveth wisdom ; out of his mouth [ come ] knowledge and understanding .
DARBY	Proverbs	2	7	He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright ; [ he ] is a shield to them that walk in integrity ;
DARBY	Proverbs	2	8	guarding the paths of just judgment and keeping the way of his godly ones .
DARBY	Proverbs	2	9	Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity : every good path .
DARBY	Proverbs	2	10	When wisdom entereth into thy heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul ,
DARBY	Proverbs	2	11	discretion shall keep thee , understanding shall preserve thee :
DARBY	Proverbs	2	12	To deliver thee from the way of evil , from the man that speaketh froward things ;
DARBY	Proverbs	2	13	[ from those ] who leave the paths of uprightness , to walk in the ways of darkness ;
DARBY	Proverbs	2	14	who rejoice to do evil , [ and ] delight in the frowardness of evil ;
DARBY	Proverbs	2	15	whose paths are crooked , and who are perverted in their course :
DARBY	Proverbs	2	16	To deliver thee from the strange woman , from the stranger who flattereth with her words ;
DARBY	Proverbs	2	17	who forsaketh the guide of her youth , and forgetteth the covenant of her God ;
DARBY	Proverbs	2	18	—for her house inclineth unto death , and her paths unto the dead ;
DARBY	Proverbs	2	19	none that go unto her return again , neither do they attain to the paths of life :
DARBY	Proverbs	2	20	—that thou mayest walk in the way of the good , and keep the paths of the righteous .
DARBY	Proverbs	2	21	For the upright shall dwell in the land , and the perfect shall remain in it ;
DARBY	Proverbs	2	22	but the wicked shall be cut off from the land , and the unfaithful shall be plucked up out of it .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	3	Let not loving-kindness and truth forsake thee ; bind them about thy neck , write them upon the tablet of thy heart :
DARBY	Proverbs	3	2	for length of days , and years of life , and peace shall they add to thee .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	4	and thou shalt find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	5	Confide in Jehovah with all thy heart , and lean not unto thine own intelligence ;
DARBY	Proverbs	3	6	in all thy ways acknowledge him , and he will make plain thy paths .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	7	Be not wise in thine own eyes ; fear Jehovah , and depart from evil :
DARBY	Proverbs	3	8	it shall be health for thy navel , and moisture for thy bones .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	9	Honour Jehovah with thy substance , and with the first-fruits of all thine increase ;
DARBY	Proverbs	3	10	so shall thy barns be filled with plenty , and thy vats shall overflow with new wine .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	11	My son , despise not the instruction of Jehovah , neither be weary of his chastisement ;
DARBY	Proverbs	3	12	for whom Jehovah loveth he chasteneth , even as a father the son in whom he delighteth .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	13	Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom , and the man that getteth understanding .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	14	For the gain thereof is better than the gain of silver , and her revenue than fine gold .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	15	She is more precious than rubies ; and all the things thou canst desire are not equal unto her .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	16	Length of days is in her right hand ; in her left hand riches and honour .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	17	Her ways are ways of pleasantness , and all her paths are peace .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	18	She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her ; and happy is he that retaineth her .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	19	Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth ; by understanding he established the heavens .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	20	By his knowledge the deeps were broken up , and the skies drop down the dew .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	21	My son , let them not depart from thine eyes ; keep sound wisdom and discretion :
DARBY	Proverbs	3	22	so shall they be life unto thy soul , and grace unto thy neck .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	23	Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely , and thy foot shall not stumble ;
DARBY	Proverbs	3	24	when thou liest down , thou shalt not be afraid , but thou shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	25	Be not afraid of sudden fear , neither of the destruction of the wicked , when it cometh ;
DARBY	Proverbs	3	26	for Jehovah shall be thy confidence , and he will keep thy foot from being taken .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	27	Withhold not good from them to whom it is due , when it is in the power of thy hand to do it .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	28	Say not unto thy neighbour , Go , and come again , and to-morrow I will give , when thou hast it by thee .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	29	Devise not evil against thy neighbour , seeing he dwelleth securely by thee .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	30	Strive not with a man without cause , if he have done thee no harm .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	31	Envy not the man of violence , and choose none of his ways .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	32	For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah ; but his secret is with the upright .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	33	The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked ; but he blesseth the habitation of the righteous .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	34	He indeed scorneth the scorners ; but he giveth grace unto the lowly .
DARBY	Proverbs	3	35	The wise shall inherit glory ; but shame shall be the promotion of the foolish .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	4	And he taught me , and said unto me , Let thy heart retain my words ; keep my commandments and live .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	2	for I give you good doctrine : forsake ye not my law .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	3	For I was a son unto my father , tender and an only one in the sight of my mother .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	5	Get wisdom , get intelligence : forget [ it ] not ; neither decline from the words of my mouth .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	6	Forsake her not , and she shall keep thee ; love her , and she shall preserve thee .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	7	The beginning of wisdom [ is ] , Get wisdom ; and with all thy getting get intelligence .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	8	Exalt her , and she shall promote thee ; she shall bring thee to honour when thou dost embrace her .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	9	She shall give to thy head a garland of grace ; a crown of glory will she bestow upon thee .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	10	Hear , my son , and receive my sayings , and the years of thy life shall be multiplied .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	11	I will teach thee in the way of wisdom , I will lead thee in paths of uprightness .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	12	When thou goest , thy steps shall not be straitened ; and when thou runnest , thou shalt not stumble .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	13	Take fast hold of instruction , let [ her ] not go : keep her , for she is thy life .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	14	Enter not into the path of the wicked , and go not in the way of evil [ men ] :
DARBY	Proverbs	4	15	avoid it , pass not by it ; turn from it , and pass away .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	16	For they sleep not except they have done mischief , and their sleep is taken away unless they have caused [ some ] to fall .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	17	For they eat the bread of wickedness , and drink the wine of violence .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	18	But the path of the righteous is as the shining light , going on and brightening until the day be fully come .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	19	The way of the wicked is as darkness : they know not at what they stumble .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	20	My son , attend to my words ; incline thine ear unto my sayings .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	21	Let them not depart from thine eyes ; keep them in the midst of thy heart .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	22	For they are life unto those that find them , and health to all their flesh .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	23	Keep thy heart more than anything that is guarded ; for out of it are the issues of life .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	24	Put away from thee perverseness of mouth , and corrupt lips put far from thee .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	25	Let thine eyes look right on , and let thine eyelids look straight before thee .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	26	Ponder the path of thy feet , and let all thy ways be well-ordered .
DARBY	Proverbs	4	27	Turn not to the right hand nor to the left ; remove thy foot from evil .
DARBY	Proverbs	5	5	Her feet go down to death ; her steps take hold on Sheol .
DARBY	Proverbs	5	2	that thou mayest keep reflection , and that thy lips may preserve knowledge .
DARBY	Proverbs	5	3	For the lips of the strange woman drop honey , and her mouth is smoother than oil ;
DARBY	Proverbs	5	4	but her end is bitter as wormwood , sharp as a two-edged sword .
DARBY	Proverbs	5	6	Lest she should ponder the path of life , her ways wander , she knoweth not [ whither ] .
DARBY	Proverbs	5	7	And now , children , hearken unto me , and depart not from the words of my mouth .
DARBY	Proverbs	5	8	Remove thy way far from her , and come not nigh the door of her house :
DARBY	Proverbs	5	9	lest thou give thine honour unto others , and thy years unto the cruel ;
DARBY	Proverbs	5	10	lest strangers be filled with thy wealth , and the fruits of thy toil [ come ] into the house of a stranger ;
DARBY	Proverbs	5	11	and thou mourn in thine end , when thy flesh and thy body are consumed ;
DARBY	Proverbs	5	12	and thou say , How have I hated instruction , and my heart despised reproof !
DARBY	Proverbs	5	13	and I have not hearkened unto the voice of my teachers , nor inclined mine ear to those that instructed me ;
DARBY	Proverbs	5	14	I was well nigh in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly .
DARBY	Proverbs	5	15	Drink waters out of thine own cistern , and running waters out of thine own well .
DARBY	Proverbs	5	16	Thy fountains shall be poured forth , as water-brooks in the broadways .
DARBY	Proverbs	5	17	Let them be only thine own , and not strangers ' with thee .
DARBY	Proverbs	5	18	Let thy fountain be blessed ; and have joy of the wife of thy youth .
DARBY	Proverbs	5	19	As a lovely hind and a graceful roe , let her breasts satisfy thee at all times : be thou ravished continually with her love .
DARBY	Proverbs	5	20	And why shouldest thou , my son , be ravished with a strange woman , and embrace the bosom of a stranger ?
DARBY	Proverbs	5	21	For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah , and he pondereth all his paths .
DARBY	Proverbs	5	22	His own iniquities shall take the wicked , and he shall be holden with the cords of his sin .

DARBY	Proverbs	31	8	Open thy mouth for the dumb , for the cause of all those that are left desolate .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	9	Open thy mouth , judge righteously , and minister justice to the afflicted and needy .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	10	Who can find a woman of worth ? for her price is far above rubies .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	11	The heart of her husband confideth in her , and he shall have no lack of spoil .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	12	She doeth him good , and not evil , all the days of her life .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	13	She seeketh wool and flax , and worketh willingly with her hands .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	14	She is like the merchants ' ships : she bringeth her food from afar ;
DARBY	Proverbs	31	15	And she riseth while it is yet night , and giveth meat to her household , and the day 's work to her maidens .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	16	She considereth a field , and acquireth it ; of the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	17	She girdeth her loins with strength , and maketh strong her arms .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	18	She perceiveth that her earning is good ; her lamp goeth not out by night .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	19	She putteth her hands to the distaff , and her hands hold the spindle .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	20	She stretcheth out her hand to the afflicted , and she reacheth forth her hands to the needy .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	21	She is not afraid of the snow for her household ; for all her household are clothed with scarlet .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	22	She maketh herself coverlets ; her clothing is byssus and purple .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	23	Her husband is known in the gates , when he sitteth among the elders of the land .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	24	She maketh body linen and selleth it , and delivereth girdles unto the merchant .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	25	Strength and dignity are her clothing , and she laugheth [ at ] the coming day .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	26	She openeth her mouth with wisdom ; and upon her tongue is the law of kindness .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	27	She surveyeth the ways of her household , and eateth not the bread of idleness .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	28	Her children rise up and call her blessed ; her husband [ also ] , and he praiseth her :
DARBY	Proverbs	31	29	Many daughters have done worthily , but thou excellest them all .
DARBY	Proverbs	31	30	Gracefulness is deceitful and beauty is vain ; a woman [ that ] feareth Jehovah , she shall be praised .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	1	The words of the Preacher , the son of David , king in Jerusalem .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	2	Vanity of vanities , saith the Preacher , vanity of vanities ! all is vanity .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	3	What profit hath man of all his labour wherewith he laboureth under the sun ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	4	[ One ] generation passeth away , and [ another ] generation cometh , but the earth standeth for ever .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	5	The sun also riseth , and the sun goeth down , and hasteth to its place where it ariseth .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	6	The wind goeth towards the south , and turneth about towards the north : it turneth about continually , and the wind returneth again to its circuits .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	7	All the rivers run into the sea , yet the sea is not full : unto the place whither the rivers go , thither they go again .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	8	All things are full of toil ; none can express it . The eye is not satisfied with seeing , nor the ear filled with hearing .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	9	That which hath been is that which shall be ; and that which hath been done is that which will be done : and there is nothing new under the sun .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	10	Is there a thing whereof it may be said , See , this is new ? It hath been already in the ages which were before us .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	11	There is no remembrance of former things ; neither shall there be remembrance of things that are to come with those who shall live afterwards .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	12	I , the Preacher , was king over Israel in Jerusalem .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	13	And I applied my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the heavens : this grievous occupation hath God given to the children of men to weary themselves therewith .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	14	I have seen all the works that are done under the sun , and behold , all is vanity and pursuit of the wind .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	15	That which is crooked can not be made straight ; and that which is wanting can not be numbered .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	16	I communed with mine own heart , saying , Lo , I have become great and have acquired wisdom more than all they that have been before me over Jerusalem ; and my heart hath seen much of wisdom and knowledge .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	17	And I applied my heart to the knowledge of wisdom , and to the knowledge of madness and folly : I perceived that this also is a striving after the wind .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	1	18	For in much wisdom is much vexation , and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	2	I said of laughter , Madness ! and of mirth , What availeth it ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	3	I searched in my heart how to cherish my flesh with wine , while practising my heart with wisdom ; and how to lay hold on folly , till I should see what was that good for the children of men which they should do under the heavens all the days of their life .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	4	I made me great works ; I builded me houses ; I planted me vineyards ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	5	I made me gardens and parks , and I planted trees in them of every kind of fruit ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	6	I made me ponds of water , to water therewith the wood , where the trees are reared .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	7	I acquired servants and maidens , and had servants born in my house ; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks , above all that had been in Jerusalem before me .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	8	I gathered me also silver and gold , and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces ; I got me men-singers and women-singers , and the delights of the children of men , a wife and concubines .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	9	And I became great , and increased more than all that had been before me in Jerusalem : also my wisdom remained with me .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	10	And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them : I withheld not my heart from any joy ; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour , and this was my portion from all my labour .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	11	Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought , and on the labour that it had cost me to do [ them ] ; and behold , all was vanity and pursuit of the wind , and there was no profit under the sun .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	12	And I turned myself to behold wisdom , and madness , and folly ; for what shall the man [ do ] that cometh after the king ? —that which hath already been done .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	13	And I saw that wisdom excelleth folly , as light excelleth darkness .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	14	The wise man 's eyes are in his head , and the fool walketh in darkness ; but I myself also perceived that one event happeneth to them all .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	15	And I said in my heart , As it happeneth to the fool so will it happen even to me ; and why was I then so wise ? Then I said in my heart that this also is vanity .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	16	For there shall be no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever ; because everything is already forgotten in the days which come . And how dieth the wise even as the fool ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	17	And I hated life ; for the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me ; for all is vanity and pursuit of the wind .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	18	And I hated all my labour wherewith I had been toiling under the sun , because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	19	And who knoweth whether he will be a wise [ man ] or a fool ? yet shall he have rule over all my labour at which I have laboured , and wherein I have been wise under the sun . This also is vanity .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	20	Then I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour wherewith I had laboured under the sun .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	21	For there is a man whose labour hath been with wisdom , and with knowledge , and with skill , and who leaveth it to a man that hath not laboured therein , to be his portion . This also is vanity and a great evil .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	22	For what will man have of all his labour and of the striving of his heart , wherewith he hath wearied himself under the sun ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	23	For all his days are sorrows , and his travail vexation : even in the night his heart taketh no rest . This also is vanity .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	24	There is nothing good for man , but that he should eat and drink , and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour . This also I saw , that it was from the hand of God .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	25	For who can eat , or who be eager , more than I ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	2	26	For he giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom , and knowledge , and joy ; but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and to heap up , that he may give to him that is good in God 's sight . This also is vanity and pursuit of the wind .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	3	A time to kill , and a time to heal ; A time to break down , and a time to build up ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	2	A time to be born , and a time to die ; A time to plant , and a time to pluck up that which is planted ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	4	A time to weep , and a time to laugh ; A time to mourn , and a time to dance ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	5	A time to cast away stones , and a time to gather stones together ; A time to embrace , and a time to refrain from embracing ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	6	A time to seek , and a time to lose ; A time to keep , and a time to cast away ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	7	A time to rend , and a time to sew ; A time to keep silence , and a time to speak ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	8	A time to love , and a time to hate ; A time of war , and a time of peace .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	9	What profit hath he that worketh from that wherein he laboureth ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	10	I have seen the travail that God hath given to the sons of men to toil in .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	11	He hath made everything beautiful in its time ; also he hath set the world in their heart , so that man findeth not out from the beginning to the end the work that God doeth .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	12	I know that there is nothing good for them but to rejoice and to do well in their life ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	13	yea also that every man should eat and drink , and enjoy good in all his labour , it is the gift of God .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	14	I know that whatever God doeth , it shall be for ever ; there is nothing to be added to it , nor anything to be taken from it ; and God doeth [ it ] , that [ men ] should fear before him .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	15	That which is was long ago , and that which is to be hath already been ; and God bringeth back again that which is past .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	16	And moreover I saw under the sun , that in the place of judgment , wickedness was there ; and in the place of righteousness , wickedness was there .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	17	I said in my heart , God will judge the righteous and the wicked ; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	18	I said in my heart , It is thus with the children of men , that God may prove them , and that they should see that they themselves are but beasts .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	19	For what befalleth the children of men befalleth beasts ; even one thing befalleth them : as the one dieth , so dieth the other , and they have all one breath ; and man hath no pre-eminence above the beast : for all is vanity .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	20	All go unto one place : all are of the dust , and all return to dust .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	21	Who knoweth the spirit of the children of men ? Doth it go upwards ? and the spirit of the beasts , doth it go downwards to the earth ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	3	22	And I have seen that there is nothing better than that man should rejoice in his own works ; for that is his portion ; for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	4	4	And I saw all labour , and all success of work , that it is man 's jealousy of his neighbour . This also is vanity and pursuit of the wind .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	4	2	Then I praised the dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	4	3	and more fortunate than both is he who hath not yet been , who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	4	5	The fool foldeth his hands together , and eateth his own flesh .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	4	6	Better is a handful with quietness , than both hands full with labour and pursuit of the wind .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	4	7	And I returned and saw vanity under the sun .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	4	8	There is one [ alone ] and without a second ; also he hath neither son nor brother : yet is there no end of all his labour , neither is his eye satisfied with riches , and [ he saith not ] , For whom then am I labouring , and depriving my soul of good ? This also is vanity and a grievous occupation .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	4	9	Two are better than one ; because they have a good reward for their labour .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	4	10	For if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow ; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth , and who hath not another to lift him up !
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	4	11	Again , if two lie together , then they have warmth ; but how can one alone be warm ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	4	12	And if a [ man ] overpower the one , the two shall withstand him ; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	4	13	Better is a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king , who knoweth no more how to be admonished .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	4	14	For out of the prison-house he came forth to reign , although he was born poor in his kingdom .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	4	15	I saw all the living that walk under the sun , with the child , the second , that should stand up in his stead .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	4	16	[ There is ] no end of all the people , of all that stood before them ; those however that come after shall not rejoice in him . Surely this also is vanity and a striving after the wind .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	5	Better is it that thou shouldest not vow , than that thou shouldest vow and not pay .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	2	Be not rash with thy mouth , and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before God : for God is in the heavens , and thou upon earth ; therefore let thy words be few .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	3	For a dream cometh through the multitude of business , and a fool 's voice through a multitude of words .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	4	When thou vowest a vow unto God , defer not to pay it ; for he hath no pleasure in fools : pay that which thou hast vowed .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	6	Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin ; neither say thou before the angel , that it was an inadvertence . Wherefore should God be wroth at thy voice , and destroy the work of thy hands ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	7	For in the multitude of dreams are vanities ; so with many words : but fear God .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	8	If thou seest the oppression of the poor , and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province , marvel not at the matter ; for a higher than the high is watching , and there are higher than they .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	9	Moreover the earth is every way profitable : the king [ himself ] is dependent upon the field .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	10	He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver , nor he that loveth abundance with increase . This also is vanity .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	11	When goods increase , they are increased that eat them ; and what profit is there to the owner thereof , except the beholding [ of them ] with his eyes ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	12	The sleep of the labourer is sweet , whether he have eaten little or much ; but the fulness of the rich doth not suffer him to sleep .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	13	There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun : riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	14	or those riches perish by some evil circumstance , and if he have begotten a son , there is nothing in his hand .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	15	As he came forth from his mother 's womb , naked shall he go away again as he came , and shall take nothing of his labour , which he may carry away in his hand .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	16	And this also is a grievous evil , that in all points as he came so doth he go away , and what profit hath he , in having laboured for the wind ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	17	All his days also he eateth in darkness , and hath much vexation , and sickness , and irritation .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	18	Behold what I have seen good and comely : [ it is ] to eat and to drink , and to enjoy good in all his labour wherewith [ man ] laboureth under the sun , all the days of his life which God hath given him : for that is his portion .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	19	Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth , and power to eat thereof , and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour : that is a gift of God .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	5	20	For he will not much remember the days of his life , because God answereth [ him ] with the joy of his heart .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	6	6	Yea , though he live twice a thousand years , yet hath he seen no good : do not all go to one place ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	6	2	one to whom God giveth riches , wealth , and honour , and he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth , yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof , but a stranger eateth it : this is vanity , and a sore evil .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	6	3	If a man beget a hundred [ sons ] , and live many years , so that the days of his years be many , but his soul be not filled with good , and also he have no burial , I say an untimely birth is better than he .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	6	4	For it cometh in vanity , and departeth in darkness , and its name is covered with darkness ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	6	5	moreover it hath not seen nor known the sun : this hath rest rather than the other .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	6	7	All the labour of man is for his mouth , and yet the appetite is not filled .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	6	8	For what advantage hath the wise above the fool ? what hath the poor , that knoweth to walk before the living ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	6	9	Better is the seeing of the eyes than the wandering of the desire : this also is vanity and pursuit of the wind .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	6	10	That which is hath already been named ; and what man is , is known , and that he can not contend with him that is mightier than he .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	6	11	For there are many things that increase vanity : what is man advantaged ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	6	12	For who knoweth what is good for man in life , all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow ? for who can tell man what shall be after him under the sun ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	7	Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad , and a gift destroyeth the heart .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	2	It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting : in that that is the end of all men , and the living taketh it to heart .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	3	Vexation is better than laughter ; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	4	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning , but the heart of fools in the house of mirth .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	5	It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise , than to hear the song of fools .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	6	For as the crackling of thorns under a pot , so is the laughter of the fool . This also is vanity .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	8	Better is the end of a thing than its beginning ; better is a patient spirit than a proud spirit .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	9	Be not hasty in thy spirit to be vexed ; for vexation resteth in the bosom of fools .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	10	Say not , How is it that the former days were better than these ? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	11	Wisdom is as good as an inheritance , and profitable to them that see the sun .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	12	For wisdom is a defence [ as ] money is a defence ; but the excellency of knowledge is , [ that ] wisdom maketh them that possess it to live .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	13	Consider the work of God ; for who can make straight what he hath made crooked ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	14	In the day of prosperity enjoy good , and in the day of adversity consider : God hath also set the one beside the other , to the end that man should find out nothing [ of what shall be ] after him .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	15	All [ this ] have I seen in the days of my vanity : there is a righteous [ man ] that perisheth by his righteousness , and there is a wicked [ man ] that prolongeth [ his days ] by his wickedness .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	16	Be not righteous overmuch ; neither make thyself overwise : why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	17	Be not overmuch wicked , neither be thou foolish : why shouldest thou die before thy time ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	18	It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this ; yea , also from that withdraw not thy hand : for he that feareth God cometh forth from them all .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	19	Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty [ men ] that are in a city .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	20	Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth , that doeth good and sinneth not .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	21	Also give not heed unto all words that are spoken , lest thou hear thy servant curse thee .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	22	For also thine own heart knoweth that oftentimes thou thyself likewise hast cursed others .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	23	All this have I tried by wisdom : I said , I will be wise ; but it was far from me .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	24	Whatever hath been , is far off , and exceeding deep : who will find it out ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	25	I turned , I and my heart , to know , and to search , and to seek out wisdom and reason , and to know wickedness to be folly , and foolishness to be madness ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	26	and I found more bitter than death the woman whose heart is nets and snares , [ and ] whose hands are bands : whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her ; but the sinner shall be caught by her .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	27	See this which I have found , saith the Preacher , [ searching ] one by one to find out the reason ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	28	which my soul yet seeketh , and I have not found : one man among a thousand have I found , but a woman among all those have I not found .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	7	29	Only see this which I have found : that God made man upright , but they have sought out many devices .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	8	8	There is no man who hath control over the spirit to retain the spirit ; and no one hath control over the day of death ; and there is no discharge in that war , neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	8	2	I [ say ] , Keep the king 's commandment , and [ that ] on account of the oath of God .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	8	3	Be not hasty to go out of his sight ; persist not in an evil thing : for he doeth whatever pleaseth him ,
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	8	4	because the word of a king is power ; and who may say unto him , What doest thou ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	8	5	Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing ; and a wise man 's heart knoweth time and manner .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	8	6	For to every purpose there is time and manner . For the misery of man is great upon him ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	8	7	for he knoweth not that which shall be ; for who can tell him how it shall be ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	8	9	All this have I seen , and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun : there is a time when man ruleth man to his hurt .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	8	10	And I have also seen the wicked buried and going away ; and such as had acted rightly went from [ the ] holy place , and were forgotten in the city . This also is vanity .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	8	11	Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the children of men is fully set in them to do evil .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	8	12	Though a sinner do evil a hundred times , and prolong his [ days ] , yet I know that it shall be well with them that fear God , because they fear before him ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	8	13	but it shall not be well with the wicked , neither shall he prolong [ his ] days as a shadow , because he feareth not before God .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	8	14	There is a vanity which is done upon the earth ; that there are righteous [ men ] unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked ; and there are wicked [ men ] to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous . I said that this also is vanity .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	8	15	And I commended mirth , because there is nothing better for man under the sun than to eat , and to drink , and to be merry ; for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life , which God hath given him under the sun .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	8	16	When I applied my heart to know wisdom , and to see the business that is done upon the earth ( for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes ) ,
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	8	17	then I saw that all [ is ] the work of God , [ and ] that man can not find out the work that is done under the sun : because however man may labour to seek [ it ] out , yet doth he not find [ it ] ; and even , if a wise [ man ] think to know [ it ] , he shall not be able to find [ it ] out .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	9	Enjoy life with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity , which he hath given thee under the sun , all the days of thy vanity ; for that is thy portion in life , and in thy labour wherein thou art labouring under the sun .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	2	All things [ come ] alike to all : one event to the righteous and to the wicked , to the good , and to the clean , and to the unclean , to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not : as is the good , so is the sinner ; he that sweareth , as he that feareth an oath .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	3	This is an evil among all that is done under the sun , that one thing befalleth all : yea , also the heart of the children of men is full of evil , and madness is in their heart while they live ; and after that , [ they have to go ] to the dead .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	4	For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope ; for a living dog is better than a dead lion .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	5	For the living know that they shall die ; but the dead know not anything , neither have they any more a reward , for the memory of them is forgotten .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	6	Their love also , and their hatred , and their envy is already perished ; neither have they any more for ever a portion in all that is done under the sun .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	7	Go , eat thy bread with joy , and drink thy wine with a merry heart ; for God hath already accepted thy works .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	8	Let thy garments be always white , and let not thy head lack oil .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	10	Whatever thy hand findeth to do , do with thy might ; for there is no work , nor device , nor knowledge , nor wisdom , in Sheol , whither thou goest .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	11	I returned , and saw under the sun , that the race is not to the swift , nor the battle to the strong , neither yet bread to the wise , nor yet riches to the intelligent , nor yet favour to men of knowledge ; but time and chance happeneth to them all .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	12	For man also knoweth not his time : as the fishes that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are taken with the snare , like them are the children of men snared in an evil time , when it falleth suddenly upon them .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	13	This also have I seen as wisdom under the sun , and it was great unto me .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	14	There was a little city , and few men within it ; and there came a great king against it , and encompassed it , and built great bulwarks against it :
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	15	and there was found in it a poor wise man , who by his wisdom delivered the city ; but no man remembered that poor man .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	16	Then said I , Wisdom is better than strength ; but the poor man 's wisdom is despised , and his words are not heard .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	17	The words of the wise are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	9	18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war ; but one sinner destroyeth much good .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	10	If the iron be blunt , and one do not whet the edge , then must he apply more strength ; but wisdom is profitable to give success .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	2	The heart of a wise [ man ] is at his right hand ; but a fool 's heart at his left .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	3	Yea also , when he that is a fool walketh by the way , his sense faileth [ him ] , and he saith to every one [ that ] he is a fool .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	4	If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee , leave not thy place ; for quietness pacifieth great offences .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	5	There is an evil that I have seen under the sun , as an error [ that ] proceedeth from the ruler :
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	6	folly is set in great dignities , but the rich sit in a low place .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	7	I have seen servants upon horses , and princes walking as servants upon the earth .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	8	He that diggeth a pit falleth into it ; and whoso breaketh down a hedge , a serpent biteth him .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	9	Whoso removeth stones is hurt therewith ; he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	11	If the serpent bite before enchantment , then the charmer hath no advantage .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	12	The words of a wise man 's mouth are gracious ; but the lips of a fool swallow up himself .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	13	The beginning of the words of his mouth is folly ; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	14	And the fool multiplieth words : [ yet ] man knoweth not what shall be ; and what shall be after him , who will tell him ?
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	15	The labour of fools wearieth them , because they know not how to go to the city .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	16	Woe to thee , O land , when thy king is a child , and thy princes eat in the morning !
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	17	Happy art thou , O land , when thy king is a son of nobles , and thy princes eat in [ due ] season , for strength , and not for drunkenness !
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	18	By much sloth fulness the framework falleth in ; and through idleness of the hands the house drippeth .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	19	A feast is made for laughter , and wine maketh life merry ; but money answereth everything .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	10	20	Curse not the king , no , not in thy thought ; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber : for the bird of the air will carry the voice , and that which hath wings will tell the matter .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	11	11	Cast thy bread upon the waters ; for thou shalt find it after many days .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	11	2	Give a portion to seven , and also to eight ; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	11	3	If the clouds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the earth ; and if a tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falleth , there it shall be .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	11	4	He that observeth the wind will not sow ; and he that regardeth the clouds will not reap .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	11	5	As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit , how the bones [ grow ] in the womb of her that is with child , even so thou knowest not the work of God who maketh all .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	11	6	In the morning sow thy seed , and in the evening withhold not thy hand ; for thou knowest not which shall prosper , whether this or that , or whether they both shall be alike good .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	11	7	Now the light is sweet , and pleasant is it to the eyes to see the sun ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	11	8	but if a man live many years , [ and ] rejoice in them all , yet let him remember the days of darkness ; for they shall be many : all that cometh is vanity .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	11	9	Rejoice , young man , in thy youth ; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth , and walk in the ways of thy heart , and in the sight of thine eyes ; but know that for all these [ things ] God will bring thee into judgment .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	11	10	Then remove discontent from thy heart , and put away evil from thy flesh ; for childhood and youth are vanity .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	12	12	And besides , my son , be warned by them : of making many books there is no end , and much study is a weariness of the flesh .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	12	2	before the sun , and the light , and the moon , and the stars , be darkened , and the clouds return after the rain ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	12	3	in the day when the keepers of the house tremble , and the strong men bow themselves , and the grinders cease because they are few , and those that look out of the windows are darkened ,
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	12	4	and the doors are shut toward the street ; when the sound of the grinding is subdued , and they rise up at the voice of the bird , and all the daughters of song are brought low ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	12	5	they are also afraid of what is high , and terrors are in the way , and the almond is despised , and the grasshopper is a burden , and the caper-berry is without effect ; ( for man goeth to his age-long home , and the mourners go about the streets ; )
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	12	6	—before the silver cord be loosed , or the golden bowl be broken , or the pitcher be shattered at the fountain , or the wheel be broken at the cistern ;
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	12	7	and the dust return to the earth as it was , and the spirit return unto God who gave it .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	12	8	Vanity of vanities , saith the Preacher : all is vanity .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	12	9	And moreover , because the Preacher was wise , he still taught the people knowledge ; and he pondered , and sought out , [ and ] set in order many proverbs .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	12	10	The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words ; and that which was written is upright , words of truth .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	12	11	The words of the wise are as goads , and the collections [ of them ] as nails fastened in : they are given from one shepherd .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	12	13	Let us hear the end of the whole matter : Fear God , and keep his commandments ; for this is the whole of man .
DARBY	Ecclesiastes	12	14	For God shall bring every work into judgment , with every secret thing , whether it be good or whether it be evil .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	1	The song of songs , which is Solomon 's .

DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	16	Behold , thou art fair , my beloved , yea , pleasant ; Also our bed is green .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	1	17	The beams of our houses are cedars , Our rafters are cypresses .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	2	As the lily among thorns , So is my love among the daughters .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	3	As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood , So is my beloved among the sons : In his shadow have I rapture and sit down ; And his fruit is sweet to my taste .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	4	He hath brought me to the house of wine , And his banner over me is love .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	5	Sustain ye me with raisin-cakes , Refresh me with apples ; For I am sick of love .

DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	10	My beloved spake and said unto me , Rise up , my love , my fair one , and come away .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	11	For behold , the winter is past , The rain is over , it is gone :
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	12	The flowers appear on the earth ; The time of singing is come , And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land ;
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	2	13	The fig-tree melloweth her winter figs , And the vines in bloom give forth [ their ] fragrance . Arise , my love , my fair one , and come away !

DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	6	Who is this , [ she ] that cometh up from the wilderness Like pillars of smoke , Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense , With all powders of the merchant ? …
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	7	Behold his couch , Solomon 's own : Threescore mighty men are about it , Of the mighty of Israel .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	8	They all hold the sword , Experts in war ; Each hath his sword upon his thigh Because of alarm in the nights .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	9	King Solomon made himself a palanquin Of the wood of Lebanon .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	3	10	Its pillars he made of silver , Its support of gold , Its seat of purple ; The midst thereof was paved [ with ] love By the daughters of Jerusalem .

DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	7	Thou art all fair , my love ; And there is no spot in thee .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	4	8	[ Come ] with me , from Lebanon , [ my ] spouse , With me from Lebanon , —Come , look from the top of Amanah , From the top of Senir and Hermon , From the lions ' dens , From the mountains of the leopards .

DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	5	I rose up to open to my beloved ; And my hands dropped with myrrh , And my fingers with liquid myrrh , Upon the handles of the lock .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	2	I slept , but my heart was awake . The voice of my beloved ! he knocketh : Open to me , my sister , my love , my dove , mine undefiled ; For my head is filled with dew , My locks with the drops of the night .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	3	—I have put off my tunic , how should I put it on ? I have washed my feet , how should I pollute them ? —
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	4	My beloved put in his hand by the hole [ of the door ] ; And my bowels yearned for him .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	6	I opened to my beloved ; But my beloved had withdrawn himself ; he was gone : My soul went forth when he spoke . I sought him , but I found him not ; I called him , but he gave me no answer .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	7	The watchmen that went about the city found me ; They smote me , they wounded me ; The keepers of the walls took away my veil from me .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	8	I charge you , daughters of Jerusalem , If ye find my beloved , … What will ye tell him ? —That I am sick of love .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	9	What is thy beloved more than [ another ] beloved , Thou fairest among women ? What is thy beloved more than [ another ] beloved , That thou dost so charge us ?

DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	15	His legs , pillars of marble , set upon bases of fine gold : His bearing as Lebanon , excellent as the cedars ;
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	5	16	His mouth is most sweet : Yea , he is altogether lovely . This is my beloved , yea , this is my friend , O daughters of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	6	Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep Which go up from the washing ; Which have all borne twins , And none is barren among them .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	2	My beloved is gone down into his garden , to the beds of spices , To feed in the gardens and to gather lilies .

DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	4	Thou art fair , my love , as Tirzah , Comely as Jerusalem , Terrible as troops with banners :
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	5	Turn away thine eyes from me , For they overcome me . Thy hair is as a flock of goats On the slopes of Gilead .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	7	As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples Behind thy veil .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	8	There are threescore queens , and fourscore concubines , And virgins without number :
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	9	My dove , mine undefiled , is but one ; She is the only one of her mother , She is the choice one of her that bore her . The daughters saw her , and they called her blessed ; The queens and the concubines , and they praised her .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	10	Who is she that looketh forth as the dawn , Fair as the moon , clear as the sun , Terrible as troops with banners ?
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	11	I went down into the garden of nuts , To see the verdure of the valley , To see whether the vine budded , Whether the pomegranates blossomed .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	12	Before I was aware , My soul set me upon the chariots of my willing people .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	6	13	Return , return , O Shulamite ; Return , return , that we may look upon thee.—What would ye look upon in the Shulamite ? —As it were the dance of two camps .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	7	This thy stature is like to a palm-tree , And thy breasts to grape clusters .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	2	Thy navel is a round goblet , [ which ] wanteth not mixed wine ; Thy belly a heap of wheat , set about with lilies ;
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	3	Thy two breasts are like two fawns , twins of a gazelle ;
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	4	Thy neck is as a tower of ivory ; Thine eyes , [ like ] the pools in Heshbon , By the gate of Bath-rabbim ; Thy nose like the tower of Lebanon , Which looketh toward Damascus ;
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	5	Thy head upon thee is like Carmel , And the locks of thy head like purple ; The king is fettered by [ thy ] ringlets !
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	6	How fair and how pleasant art thou , [ my ] love , in delights !
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	8	I said , I will go up to the palm-tree , I will take hold of the boughs thereof ; And thy breasts shall indeed be like clusters of the vine , And the fragrance of thy nose like apples ,
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	9	And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine , … That goeth down smoothly for my beloved , And stealeth over the lips of them that are asleep .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	10	I am my beloved 's , And his desire is toward me .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	11	—Come , my beloved , let us go forth into the fields ; Let us lodge in the villages .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	12	We will go up early to the vineyards , We will see if the vine hath budded , [ If ] the blossom is opening , And the pomegranates are in bloom : There will I give thee my loves .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	7	13	The mandrakes yield fragrance ; And at our gates are all choice fruits , new and old : I have laid them up for thee , my beloved .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	8	We have a little sister , And she hath no breasts : What shall we do for our sister In the day when she shall be spoken for ? —
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	2	I would lead thee , bring thee into my mother 's house ; Thou wouldest instruct me : I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine , Of the juice of my pomegranate .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	3	His left hand would be under my head , And his right hand embrace me .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	4	I charge you , daughters of Jerusalem , … Why should ye stir up , why awake [ my ] love , till he please ?
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	5	Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness , Leaning upon her beloved ? I awoke thee under the apple-tree : There thy mother brought thee forth ; There she brought thee forth [ that ] bore thee .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	6	Set me as a seal upon thy heart , As a seal upon thine arm : For love is strong as death ; Jealousy is cruel as Sheol : The flashes thereof are flashes of fire , Flames of Jah .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	7	Many waters can not quench love , Neither do the floods drown it : Even if a man gave all the substance of his house for love , It would utterly be contemned .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	9	If she be a wall , We will build upon her a turret of silver ; And if she be a door , We will enclose her with boards of cedar .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	10	I am a wall , and my breasts like towers ; Then was I in his eyes as one that findeth peace .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	11	Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon : He let out the vineyard unto keepers ; Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand silver-pieces .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	12	My vineyard , which is mine , is before me : The thousand [ silver-pieces ] be to thee , Solomon ; And to the keepers of its fruit , two hundred .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	13	Thou that dwellest in the gardens , The companions hearken to thy voice : Let me hear [ it ] .
DARBY	Song%20of%20Solomon	8	14	Haste , my beloved , And be thou like a gazelle or a young hart Upon the mountains of spices .

DARBY	Isaiah	1	11	To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me ? saith Jehovah . I am sated with burnt-offerings of rams , and the fat of fed beasts ; and in the blood of bullocks , and of lambs , and of he-goats I take no pleasure .
DARBY	Isaiah	1	12	When ye come to appear before me , who hath required this from your hand—to tread my courts ?

DARBY	Isaiah	1	31	And the strong shall be for tow , and his work a spark ; and they shall both burn together , and there shall be none to quench [ them ] .
DARBY	Isaiah	2	2	And it shall come to pass in the end of days , [ that ] the mountain of Jehovah 's house shall be established on the top of the mountains , and shall be lifted up above the hills ; and all the nations shall flow unto it .
DARBY	Isaiah	2	3	And many peoples shall go and say , Come , and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah , to the house of the God of Jacob ; and he will teach us of his ways , and we will walk in his paths . For out of Zion shall go forth the law , and Jehovah 's word from Jerusalem .
DARBY	Isaiah	2	4	And he shall judge among the nations , and shall reprove many peoples ; and they shall forge their swords into ploughshares , and their spears into pruning-knives : nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
DARBY	Isaiah	2	5	House of Jacob , come ye , and let us walk in the light of Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	2	6	For thou hast cast off thy people , the house of Jacob , because they are filled [ with what comes ] from the east , and use auguries like the Philistines , and ally themselves with the children of foreigners .
DARBY	Isaiah	2	7	And their land is full of silver and gold , and there is no end of their treasures : their land also is full of horses , and there is no end of their chariots .
DARBY	Isaiah	2	8	And their land is full of idols ; they bow themselves down to the work of their own hands , to that which their fingers have made .
DARBY	Isaiah	2	9	And the mean man shall be bowed down , and the great man shall be brought low : and do not thou forgive them !
DARBY	Isaiah	2	10	Enter into the rock , and hide thee in the dust , from before the terror of Jehovah , and from the glory of his majesty .
DARBY	Isaiah	2	11	The lofty eyes of man shall be brought low , and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down , and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day .
DARBY	Isaiah	2	12	For there shall be a day of Jehovah of hosts upon everything proud and lofty , and upon everything lifted up , and it shall be brought low ;
DARBY	Isaiah	2	13	and upon all the cedars of Lebanon , high and lifted up , and upon all the oaks of Bashan ;
DARBY	Isaiah	2	14	and upon all the lofty mountains , and upon all the hills that are lifted up ;
DARBY	Isaiah	2	15	and upon every high tower , and upon every fenced wall ;
DARBY	Isaiah	2	16	and upon all the ships of Tarshish , and upon all pleasant works of art .
DARBY	Isaiah	2	17	And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low ; and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day :
DARBY	Isaiah	2	18	and the idols shall utterly pass away .
DARBY	Isaiah	2	19	And they shall go into the caves of the rocks , and into the holes of the earth , from before the terror of Jehovah , and from the glory of his majesty , when he shall arise to terrify the earth .
DARBY	Isaiah	2	20	In that day men shall cast away their idols of silver and their idols of gold , which they made [ each ] for himself to worship , to the moles and to the bats ;
DARBY	Isaiah	2	21	to go into the clefts of the rocks , and into the fissures of the cliffs , from before the terror of Jehovah , and from the glory of his majesty , when he shall arise to terrify the earth .
DARBY	Isaiah	2	22	Cease ye from man , whose breath is in his nostrils ; for what account is to be made of him ?
DARBY	Isaiah	3	3	the captain of fifty , and the honourable man , and the counsellor , and the clever among artificers , and the one versed in enchantments .
DARBY	Isaiah	3	2	the mighty man and the man of war , the judge and the prophet , and the diviner and the elder ,
DARBY	Isaiah	3	4	And I will appoint youths as their princes , and children shall rule over them .
DARBY	Isaiah	3	5	And the people shall be oppressed one by the other , and each by his neighbour ; the child will be insolent against the elder , and the base against the honourable .
DARBY	Isaiah	3	6	When a man shall take hold of his brother , in his father 's house , [ and shall say : ] Thou hast clothing ; be our chief , and let this ruin be under thy hand ;
DARBY	Isaiah	3	7	he will lift up [ his hand ] in that day , saying , I can not be a healer , and in my house there is neither bread nor clothing ; ye shall not make me a chief of the people .
DARBY	Isaiah	3	8	For Jerusalem stumbleth and Judah falleth , because their tongue and their doings are against Jehovah , to provoke the eyes of his glory .
DARBY	Isaiah	3	9	The look of their face doth witness against them , and they declare their sin as Sodom : they hide it not . Woe unto their soul ! for they have brought evil upon themselves .
DARBY	Isaiah	3	10	Say ye of the righteous that it shall be well [ with him ] , for they shall eat the fruit of their doings .
DARBY	Isaiah	3	11	Woe unto the wicked ! it shall be ill [ with him ] , because the desert of his hands shall be rendered unto him .
DARBY	Isaiah	3	12	[ As for ] my people , children are their oppressors , and women rule over them . My people ! they that guide thee mislead [ thee ] , and destroy the way of thy paths .
DARBY	Isaiah	3	13	Jehovah setteth himself to plead , and standeth to judge the peoples .
DARBY	Isaiah	3	14	Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of his people and their princes , [ saying : ] It is ye that have eaten up the vineyard : the spoil of the poor is in your houses .
DARBY	Isaiah	3	15	What mean ye that ye crush my people , and grind the faces of the afflicted ? saith the Lord , Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Isaiah	3	16	And Jehovah said , Because the daughters of Zion are haughty , and walk with stretched-out neck and wanton eyes , and go along mincing , and making a tinkling with their feet ;
DARBY	Isaiah	3	17	therefore the Lord will make bald the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion , and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts .
DARBY	Isaiah	3	18	In that day the Lord will take away the ornament of anklets , and the little suns and crescents ,
DARBY	Isaiah	3	19	the pearl-drops , and the bracelets , and the veils ,
DARBY	Isaiah	3	20	the head-dresses , and the stepping chains , and the girdles , and the scent-boxes , and the amulets ;
DARBY	Isaiah	3	21	the finger-rings , and the nose-rings ;
DARBY	Isaiah	3	22	the festival-robes , and the tunics , and the mantles , and the wallets ;
DARBY	Isaiah	3	23	the mirrors , and the fine linen bodices , and the turbans , and the flowing veils .
DARBY	Isaiah	3	24	And it shall come to pass , instead of perfume there shall be rottenness ; and instead of a girdle , a rope ; and instead of well-set hair , baldness ; and instead of a robe of display , a girding of sackcloth ; brand instead of beauty .
DARBY	Isaiah	3	25	Thy men shall fall by the sword , and thy mighty in the fight ;
DARBY	Isaiah	3	26	and her gates shall lament and mourn ; and , stripped , she shall sit upon the ground .
DARBY	Isaiah	4	4	when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion , and shall have scoured out the blood of Jerusalem from its midst , by the spirit of judgment , and by the spirit of burning .
DARBY	Isaiah	4	2	In that day there shall be a sprout of Jehovah for beauty and glory , and the fruit of the earth for excellency and for ornament for those that are escaped of Israel .
DARBY	Isaiah	4	3	And it shall come to pass that he who remaineth in Zion , and he that is left in Jerusalem , shall be called holy , —every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem ;
DARBY	Isaiah	4	5	And Jehovah will create over every dwelling-place of mount Zion , and over its convocations , a cloud by day and a smoke , and the brightness of a flame of fire by night : for over all the glory shall be a covering .
DARBY	Isaiah	4	6	And there shall be a tabernacle for shade by day from the heat , and for a shelter and for a covert from storm and from rain .
DARBY	Isaiah	5	5	And now , let me tell you what I am about to do to my vineyard : I will take away its hedge , and it shall be eaten up ; I will break down its wall , and it shall be trodden under foot ;
DARBY	Isaiah	5	2	And he dug it , and gathered out the stones thereof , and planted it with the choicest vine ; and he built a tower in the midst of it , and also hewed out a winepress therein ; and he looked that it should bring forth grapes , but it brought forth wild grapes .
DARBY	Isaiah	5	3	And now , inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah , judge , I pray you , between me and my vineyard .
DARBY	Isaiah	5	4	What was there yet to do to my vineyard that I have not done in it ? Wherefore , when I looked that it should bring forth grapes , brought it forth wild grapes ? —
DARBY	Isaiah	5	6	and I will make it a waste—it shall not be pruned nor cultivated , but there shall come up briars and thorns ; and I will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it .
DARBY	Isaiah	5	7	For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel , and the men of Judah the plant of his delight : and he looked for justice , and behold , blood-shedding ; for righteousness , and behold , a cry .
DARBY	Isaiah	5	8	Woe unto them that add house to house , that join field to field , until there is no more room , and that ye dwell yourselves alone in the midst of the land !
DARBY	Isaiah	5	9	In mine ears Jehovah of hosts [ hath said ] , Many houses shall assuredly become a desolation , great and excellent ones , without inhabitant .
DARBY	Isaiah	5	10	Yea , ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath , and a homer of seed shall yield an ephah .
DARBY	Isaiah	5	11	Woe unto them that , rising early in the morning , run after strong drink ; that linger till twilight , [ till ] wine inflameth them !
DARBY	Isaiah	5	12	And harp and lyre , tambour and flute , and wine are in their banquets ; but they regard not the work of Jehovah , nor do they see the operation of his hands .
DARBY	Isaiah	5	13	Therefore my people are led away captive from lack of knowledge , and their nobility die of famine , and their multitude are parched with thirst .
DARBY	Isaiah	5	14	Therefore doth Sheol enlarge its desire , and open its mouth without measure ; and her splendour shall descend [ into it ] , and her multitude , and her tumult , and [ all ] that is joyful within her .
DARBY	Isaiah	5	15	And the mean man shall be bowed down , and the great man brought low , and the eyes of the lofty shall be brought low ;
DARBY	Isaiah	5	16	and Jehovah of hosts shall be exalted in judgment , and the holy God hallowed in righteousness .
DARBY	Isaiah	5	17	And the lambs shall feed as on their pasture , and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat .
DARBY	Isaiah	5	18	Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity , and sin as with cart-ropes !
DARBY	Isaiah	5	19	who say , Let him hasten , let him speed his work , that we may see [ it ] ; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come , that we may know it !
DARBY	Isaiah	5	20	Woe unto them who call evil good , and good evil ; who put darkness for light , and light for darkness ; who put bitter for sweet , and sweet for bitter !
DARBY	Isaiah	5	21	Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes , and intelligent in their own esteem !
DARBY	Isaiah	5	22	Woe unto them that are mighty for drinking wine , and men valiant to mix strong drink ;
DARBY	Isaiah	5	23	who justify the wicked for a bribe , and turn away the righteousness of the righteous from them !
DARBY	Isaiah	5	24	Therefore as a tongue of fire devoureth the stubble , and dry grass sinketh down in the flame , their root shall be as rottenness , and their blossom shall go up as dust ; for they have rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts , and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel .
DARBY	Isaiah	5	25	Therefore is the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people , and he hath stretched out his hand against them and hath smitten them ; and the mountains trembled , and their carcases are become as dung in the midst of the streets . For all this his anger is not turned away , and his hand is stretched out still .
DARBY	Isaiah	5	26	And he will lift up a banner to the nations afar off , and will hiss for one from the end of the earth ; and behold , it will come rapidly [ and ] lightly .
DARBY	Isaiah	5	27	None among them is weary , none stumbleth ; they slumber not , nor sleep ; none hath the girdle of his loins loosed , nor the thong of his sandals broken ;
DARBY	Isaiah	5	28	their arrows are sharp , and all their bows bent ; their horses ' hoofs are reckoned as the flint , and their wheels as a whirlwind .
DARBY	Isaiah	5	29	Their roaring is like a lioness , they roar as the young lions ; yea , they growl , and snatch the prey , and carry it away safe , and there is none to deliver ;
DARBY	Isaiah	5	30	and they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea . And if one look upon the earth , behold darkness [ and ] distress , and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof .
DARBY	Isaiah	6	6	And one of the seraphim flew unto me , and he had in his hand a glowing coal , which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar ;
DARBY	Isaiah	6	2	Seraphim were standing above him : each had six wings ; with twain he covered his face , and with twain he covered his feet , and with twain he flew .
DARBY	Isaiah	6	3	And one called to the other and said , Holy , holy , holy is Jehovah of hosts ; the whole earth is full of his glory !
DARBY	Isaiah	6	4	And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried , and the house was filled with smoke .
DARBY	Isaiah	6	5	And I said , Woe unto me ! for I am undone ; for I am a man of unclean lips , and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips : for mine eyes have seen the King , Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Isaiah	6	7	and he made it touch my mouth , and said , Behold , this hath touched thy lips ; and thine iniquity is taken away , and thy sin expiated .
DARBY	Isaiah	6	8	And I heard the voice of the Lord saying , Whom shall I send , and who will go for us ? And I said , Here am I ; send me .
DARBY	Isaiah	6	9	And he said , Go ; and thou shalt say unto this people , Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand , and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive .
DARBY	Isaiah	6	10	Make the heart of this people fat , and make their ears heavy , and blind their eyes ; lest they see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and be converted , and healed .
DARBY	Isaiah	6	11	And I said , Lord , how long ? And he said , Until the cities be wasted , without inhabitant , and the houses without man , and the land become an utter desolation ,
DARBY	Isaiah	6	12	and Jehovah have removed men far away , and the solitude be great in the midst of the land .
DARBY	Isaiah	6	13	But a tenth part shall still be therein , and it shall return and be eaten ; as the terebinth and as the oak whose trunk [ remaineth ] after the felling : the holy seed shall be the trunk thereof .
DARBY	Isaiah	7	7	thus saith the Lord Jehovah : It shall not stand , nor come to pass ;
DARBY	Isaiah	7	2	And it was told the house of David saying , Syria is allied with Ephraim . Then his heart and the heart of his people shook , as the trees of the forest are shaken with the wind .
DARBY	Isaiah	7	3	And Jehovah said to Isaiah , Go out now to meet Ahaz , thou and thy son Shear-jashub , at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool , on the highway of the fuller 's field ;
DARBY	Isaiah	7	4	and thou shalt say unto him , Take heed and be quiet ; fear not , and let not thy heart faint before these two ends of smoking firebrands , because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria , and of the son of Remaliah .
DARBY	Isaiah	7	5	Inasmuch as Syria hath taken evil counsel against thee , Ephraim [ also ] and the son of Remaliah , saying ,
DARBY	Isaiah	7	6	Let us go up against Judah , and harass it , and make a breach therein for us , and set up a king therein—the son of Tabeal ;
DARBY	Isaiah	7	8	for the head of Syria is Damascus , and the head of Damascus is Rezin ; and within sixty-five years shall Ephraim be broken , so as to be no [ more a ] people ;
DARBY	Isaiah	7	9	and the head of Ephraim is Samaria , and the head of Samaria is Remaliah 's son . If ye believe not , surely ye shall not be established .
DARBY	Isaiah	7	10	And Jehovah spoke again to Ahaz , saying ,
DARBY	Isaiah	7	11	Ask for thee a sign from Jehovah thy God ; ask for it in the deep , or in the height above .
DARBY	Isaiah	7	12	And Ahaz said , I will not ask , and will not tempt Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	7	13	And he said , Hear then , house of David : Is it a small matter for you to weary men , that ye weary also my God ?
DARBY	Isaiah	7	14	Therefore will the Lord himself give you a sign : Behold , the virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son , and call his name Immanuel .
DARBY	Isaiah	7	15	Butter and honey shall he eat , that he may know to refuse the evil , and to choose the good .
DARBY	Isaiah	7	16	For before the child knoweth to refuse the evil and to choose the good , the land whose two kings thou fearest shall be forsaken .
DARBY	Isaiah	7	17	Jehovah will bring upon thee , and upon thy people , and upon thy father 's house , days which have not come since the day when Ephraim turned away from Judah— [ even ] the king of Assyria .
DARBY	Isaiah	7	18	And it shall come to pass in that day , that Jehovah will hiss for the fly which is at the extremity of the streams of Egypt , and for the bee which is in the land of Assyria ;
DARBY	Isaiah	7	19	and they shall come and settle all of them in the desolate valleys , and in the holes of the rocks , and on all thorn-bushes , and on all the pastures .
DARBY	Isaiah	7	20	In that day will the Lord , with a razor which is hired beyond the river , with the king of Assyria , shave the head and the hair of the feet , yea , the beard also will it take away .
DARBY	Isaiah	7	21	And it shall come to pass in that day , [ that ] a man shall nourish a young cow and two sheep ,
DARBY	Isaiah	7	22	and it shall come to pass , from the abundance of milk they shall give , [ that ] he shall eat butter ; for every one that remaineth in the midst of the land shall eat butter and honey .
DARBY	Isaiah	7	23	And it shall come to pass in that day , [ that ] every place , where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver pieces , shall become briars and thorns :
DARBY	Isaiah	7	24	with arrows and with the bow shall they come thither , for the whole land shall become briars and thorns .
DARBY	Isaiah	7	25	And all mountains that have been dug up with the hoe—thither will they not come , from fear of briars and thorns ; and they shall be for the sending forth of oxen , and for the treading of small cattle .
DARBY	Isaiah	8	8	and he shall pass through Judah ; he shall overflow it and go further , he shall reach even to the neck ; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land , O Immanuel !
DARBY	Isaiah	8	2	And I took unto me to witness , sure witnesses , Urijah the priest , and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah .
DARBY	Isaiah	8	3	And I came near to the prophetess , and she conceived and bore a son ; and Jehovah said unto me , Call his name , Maher-shalal-hash-baz .
DARBY	Isaiah	8	4	For before the lad knoweth to cry , My father ! and , My mother ! the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria .
DARBY	Isaiah	8	5	And Jehovah spoke again to me , saying ,
DARBY	Isaiah	8	6	Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah which flow softly , and rejoiceth in Rezin and in the son of Remaliah ,
DARBY	Isaiah	8	7	therefore behold , the Lord will bring up upon them the waters of the river , strong and many , the king of Assyria and all his glory ; and he shall mount up over all his channels , and go over all his banks :
DARBY	Isaiah	8	9	Rage , ye peoples , and be broken in pieces ! And give ear , all ye distant parts of the earth : Gird yourselves , and be broken in pieces ; gird yourselves , and be broken in pieces !
DARBY	Isaiah	8	10	Settle a plan , and it shall come to nought ; speak a word , and it shall not stand : for God is with us .
DARBY	Isaiah	8	11	For Jehovah spoke thus to me with a strong hand , and he instructed me not to walk in the way of this people , saying ,
DARBY	Isaiah	8	12	Ye shall not say , Conspiracy , of everything of which this people saith , Conspiracy ; and fear ye not their fear , and be not in dread .
DARBY	Isaiah	8	13	Jehovah of hosts , him shall ye sanctify ; and let him be your fear , and let him be your dread .
DARBY	Isaiah	8	14	And he will be for a sanctuary ; and for a stone of stumbling , and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel , for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Isaiah	8	15	And many among them shall stumble , and fall , and be broken , and snared , and taken .
DARBY	Isaiah	8	16	Bind up the testimony , seal the law among my disciples .
DARBY	Isaiah	8	17	And I will wait for Jehovah , who hideth his face from the house of Jacob ; and I will look for him .
DARBY	Isaiah	8	18	Behold , I and the children that Jehovah hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel , from Jehovah of hosts , who dwelleth in mount Zion .
DARBY	Isaiah	8	19	And when they shall say unto you , Seek unto the necromancers and unto the soothsayers , who chirp and who mutter , [ say , ] Shall not a people seek unto their God ? [ Will they go ] for the living unto the dead ?
DARBY	Isaiah	8	20	To the law and the testimony ! If they speak not according to this word , for them there is no daybreak .
DARBY	Isaiah	8	21	And they shall pass through it , hard pressed and hungry ; and it shall come to pass when they are hungry , they will fret themselves , and curse their king and their God , and will gaze upward :
DARBY	Isaiah	8	22	and they will look to the earth ; and behold , trouble and darkness , gloom of anguish ; and they shall be driven into thick darkness .
DARBY	Isaiah	9	9	And all the people shall know [ it ] , Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria , that say in pride and stoutness of heart ,
DARBY	Isaiah	9	2	the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light ; they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death , upon them light hath shone .
DARBY	Isaiah	9	3	Thou hast multiplied the nation , hast increased its joy : they joy before thee like to the joy in harvest ; as [ men ] rejoice when they divide the spoil .
DARBY	Isaiah	9	4	For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden and the staff of his shoulder , the rod of his oppressor , as in the day of Midian .
DARBY	Isaiah	9	5	For every boot of him that is shod for the tumult , and the garment rolled in blood , shall be for burning , fuel for fire .
DARBY	Isaiah	9	6	For unto us a child is born , unto us a son is given ; and the government shall be upon his shoulder ; and his name is called Wonderful , Counsellor , Mighty God , Father of Eternity , Prince of Peace .
DARBY	Isaiah	9	7	Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end , upon the throne of David and over his kingdom , to establish it , and to uphold it with judgment and with righteousness , from henceforth even for ever . The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this .
DARBY	Isaiah	9	8	The Lord sent a word unto Jacob , and it lighteth upon Israel .
DARBY	Isaiah	9	10	The bricks are fallen down , but we will build with hewn stones ; the sycamore trees are cut down , but we will replace them with cedars .
DARBY	Isaiah	9	11	And Jehovah will set up the adversaries of Rezin against him , and arm his enemies ,
DARBY	Isaiah	9	12	the Syrians on the east , and the Philistines on the west ; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth . For all this his anger is not turned away , and his hand is stretched out still .
DARBY	Isaiah	9	13	But the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them , and they do not seek Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Isaiah	9	14	And Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail , palm-branch and rush , in one day :
DARBY	Isaiah	9	15	the ancient and honourable , he is the head ; and the prophet that teacheth lies , he is the tail .
DARBY	Isaiah	9	16	For the guides of this people mislead [ them ] ; and they that are guided by them are swallowed up .
DARBY	Isaiah	9	17	Therefore the Lord will not rejoice in their young men , neither will he have mercy on their fatherless and on their widows ; for every one is a hypocrite and an evildoer , and every mouth speaketh folly . For all this his anger is not turned away , and his hand is stretched out still .
DARBY	Isaiah	9	18	For wickedness burneth as a fire : it devoureth briars and thorns , and kindleth in the thickets of the forest , and they go rolling up like a pillar of smoke .
DARBY	Isaiah	9	19	Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts is the land burned up , and the people is as fuel for fire : a man spareth not his brother ;
DARBY	Isaiah	9	20	and he snatcheth on the right hand , and is hungry , and eateth on the left hand ; and they are not satisfied . They eat every man the flesh of his own arm :
DARBY	Isaiah	9	21	Manasseh , Ephraim , and Ephraim , Manasseh ; [ and ] they together are against Judah . For all this his anger is not turned away , and his hand is stretched out still .
DARBY	Isaiah	10	10	As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols , —and their graven images exceeded those of Jerusalem and Samaria ,
DARBY	Isaiah	10	2	to turn away the poor from judgment , and to take away the right from the afflicted of my people ; that widows may be their prey , and that they may rob the fatherless !
DARBY	Isaiah	10	3	And what will ye do in the day of visitation , and in the sudden destruction [ which ] shall come from far ? To whom will ye flee for help , and where will ye leave your glory ?
DARBY	Isaiah	10	4	They can but crouch under the prisoners , and they shall fall under the slain . For all this his anger is not turned away , and his hand is stretched out still .
DARBY	Isaiah	10	5	Ah ! the Assyrian ! the rod of mine anger ! and the staff in their hand is mine indignation .
DARBY	Isaiah	10	6	I will send him against a hypocritical nation , and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge ; to take the spoil , and to seize the prey , and to tread them down like the mire of the streets .
DARBY	Isaiah	10	7	But he meaneth not so , neither doth his heart think so ; for it is in his heart to extirpate and cut off nations not a few .
DARBY	Isaiah	10	8	For he saith , Are not my princes all kings ?
DARBY	Isaiah	10	9	Is not Calno as Karkemish ? Is not Hamath as Arpad ? Is not Samaria as Damascus ?
DARBY	Isaiah	10	11	—shall I not , as I have done unto Samaria and her idols , so do to Jerusalem and her images ?
DARBY	Isaiah	10	12	And it shall come to pass , when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and upon Jerusalem , I will punish the fruit of the stoutness of heart of the king of Assyria , and the glory of his high looks .
DARBY	Isaiah	10	13	For he saith , By the strength of my hand I have done [ it ] , and by my wisdom , for I am intelligent ; and I have removed the bounds of the peoples , and have robbed their treasures , and , like a valiant man , I have brought down them that sit [ on thrones ] ;
DARBY	Isaiah	10	14	and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the peoples , and as one gathereth forsaken eggs , have I gathered all the earth ; and there was none that moved the wing , or opened the mouth , or chirped .
DARBY	Isaiah	10	15	—Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith ? shall the saw magnify itself against him that wieldeth it ? As if the rod should wield them that lift it up ; as if the staff should lift up [ him who is ] not wood !
DARBY	Isaiah	10	16	Therefore shall the Lord , Jehovah of hosts , send among his fat ones leanness , and under his glory he shall kindle a burning , like the burning of a fire :
DARBY	Isaiah	10	17	and the light of Israel shall be for a fire , and his Holy One for a flame ; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briars in one day ,
DARBY	Isaiah	10	18	and it shall consume the glory of his forest , and of his fruitful field , both soul and body ; and they shall be as when a sick man fainteth .
DARBY	Isaiah	10	19	And the remainder of the trees of his forest shall be few : yea , a child might write them .
DARBY	Isaiah	10	20	And it shall come to pass in that day , [ that ] the remnant of Israel and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob shall no more again rely upon him that smote them ; but they shall rely upon Jehovah , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
DARBY	Isaiah	10	21	The remnant shall return , the remnant of Jacob , unto the mighty God .
DARBY	Isaiah	10	22	For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea , [ only ] a remnant of them shall return : the consumption determined shall overflow in righteousness .
DARBY	Isaiah	10	23	For a consumption , and [ one ] determined , will the Lord , Jehovah of hosts , accomplish in the midst of all the land .
DARBY	Isaiah	10	24	Therefore thus saith the Lord , Jehovah of hosts : O my people that dwellest in Zion , be not afraid of the Assyrian ; he shall smite thee with a rod , and shall lift up his staff against thee , after the manner of Egypt :

DARBY	Isaiah	19	11	They are but fools , the princes of Zoan , the wise counsellors of Pharaoh : [ their ] counsel is become senseless . How say ye unto Pharaoh , I am the son of the wise , the son of ancient kings ?
DARBY	Isaiah	19	12	Where are they then , thy wise [ men ] ? Let them now tell thee , and let them make known what Jehovah of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt .
DARBY	Isaiah	19	13	The princes of Zoan are become foolish , the princes of Noph are deceived ; and the corner-stones of its tribes have caused Egypt to err .
DARBY	Isaiah	19	14	Jehovah hath mingled a spirit of perverseness in the midst thereof ; and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof , as a drunkard staggereth in his vomit .
DARBY	Isaiah	19	15	Neither shall there be any work for Egypt , which the head or tail , palm-branch or rush , may do .
DARBY	Isaiah	19	16	In that day shall Egypt be like unto women ; and it shall tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of hosts , which he shaketh over it .

DARBY	Isaiah	20	20	In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod , when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him , ( and he fought against Ashdod and took it , )
DARBY	Isaiah	20	2	at that time spoke Jehovah by Isaiah the son of Amoz , saying , Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins , and put off thy sandal from thy foot . And he did so , walking naked and barefoot .
DARBY	Isaiah	20	3	And Jehovah said , Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years , a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia ,
DARBY	Isaiah	20	4	so shall the king of Assyria lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia , young and old , naked and barefoot , and with buttocks uncovered , [ to ] the shame of Egypt .

DARBY	Isaiah	21	4	My heart panteth , horror affrighteth me : the night of my pleasure hath he turned into trembling unto me .
DARBY	Isaiah	21	5	Prepare the table , appoint the watch ; eat , drink : arise , ye princes , anoint the shield .

DARBY	Isaiah	21	9	—And behold , there cometh a chariot of men ; horsemen by pairs . And he answered and said , Babylon is fallen , is fallen ; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground .
DARBY	Isaiah	21	10	O my threshing , and the corn of my floor ! What I have heard of Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel , have I declared unto you .
DARBY	Isaiah	21	11	The burden of Dumah . He calleth to me out of Seir , Watchman , what of the night ? Watchman , what of the night ?
DARBY	Isaiah	21	12	The watchman said , The morning cometh , and also the night : if ye will inquire , inquire ; return , come .
DARBY	Isaiah	21	13	The burden against Arabia . In the forest of Arabia shall ye lodge , [ ye ] caravans of Dedanites .
DARBY	Isaiah	21	14	Bring ye water to meet the thirsty ! The inhabitants of the land of Tema come forth with their bread for him that fleeth .
DARBY	Isaiah	21	15	For they flee from the swords , from the drawn sword , and from the bent bow , and from the grievousness of war .
DARBY	Isaiah	21	16	For thus hath the Lord said unto me : Within a year , according to the years of a hired servant , and all the glory of Kedar shall fail ;
DARBY	Isaiah	21	17	and the residue of the number of the archers , the mighty men of the sons of Kedar , shall be diminished : for Jehovah , the God of Israel , hath spoken .
DARBY	Isaiah	22	22	And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder ; and he shall open , and none shall shut ; and he shall shut , and none shall open .
DARBY	Isaiah	22	2	Thou that wast full of stir , a town of tumult , a joyous city : thy slain men are not slain with the sword , nor dead in battle .
DARBY	Isaiah	22	3	All thy rulers have fled together , they are taken prisoners without the bow : all that are found of thee are made prisoners together ; they were fleeing far off .
DARBY	Isaiah	22	4	Therefore said I , Look away from me ; let me weep bitterly : labour not to comfort me , because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people .
DARBY	Isaiah	22	5	For it is a day of trouble , and of treading down , and of perplexity , from the Lord , Jehovah of hosts , in the valley of vision ; [ a day of ] breaking down the wall , and of crying to the mountain :
DARBY	Isaiah	22	6	—Elam beareth the quiver with chariots of men [ and ] horsemen ; and Kir uncovereth the shield .
DARBY	Isaiah	22	7	And it shall come to pass [ that ] thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots , and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate .
DARBY	Isaiah	22	8	And he uncovereth the covering of Judah : and thou didst look in that day to the armour in the house of the forest ;
DARBY	Isaiah	22	9	and ye have seen the breaches of the city of David , that they are many ; and ye have gathered together the waters of the lower pool ;
DARBY	Isaiah	22	10	and ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem , and have broken down the houses to fortify the wall ;
DARBY	Isaiah	22	11	and ye have made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool : but ye have not had regard unto the maker thereof , neither have ye looked unto him that fashioned it long ago .
DARBY	Isaiah	22	12	And in that day did the Lord Jehovah of hosts call to weeping , and to mourning , and to baldness , and to girding with sackcloth ;
DARBY	Isaiah	22	13	and behold joy and rejoicing , slaying oxen , and killing sheep , eating flesh , and drinking wine : —Let us eat and drink , for to-morrow we die .
DARBY	Isaiah	22	14	And it was revealed in mine ears by Jehovah of hosts : Assuredly this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die , saith the Lord , Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Isaiah	22	15	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts : Go , get thee in unto this steward , unto Shebna , who is over the house , [ and say , ]
DARBY	Isaiah	22	16	What hast thou here ? and whom hast thou here , that thou hast hewn thee out a sepulchre here , [ as ] he that heweth out his sepulchre on high , cutting out in the rock a habitation for himself ?
DARBY	Isaiah	22	17	Behold , Jehovah will hurl thee with the force of a mighty man , and will cover thee entirely .
DARBY	Isaiah	22	18	Rolling thee up completely , he will roll thee as a ball into a wide country : there shalt thou die , and there shall be the chariots of thy glory , O shame of thy lord 's house !
DARBY	Isaiah	22	19	And I will drive thee from thine office , and from thy station will I pull thee down .
DARBY	Isaiah	22	20	And it shall come to pass in that day , that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkijah ;
DARBY	Isaiah	22	21	and I will clothe him with thy robe , and strengthen him with thy girdle , and I will commit thy government into his hand ; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Judah .
DARBY	Isaiah	22	23	And I will fasten him [ as ] a nail in a sure place ; and he shall be for a throne of glory to his father 's house :
DARBY	Isaiah	22	24	and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father 's house , the offspring and the issue , all the small vessels , as well the vessels of cups as all the vessels of flagons .
DARBY	Isaiah	22	25	In that day , saith Jehovah of hosts , shall the nail that is fastened in a sure place be removed , and be cut down , and fall ; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off : for Jehovah hath spoken .
DARBY	Isaiah	23	23	The burden of Tyre . Howl , ye ships of Tarshish ! for it is laid waste , so that there is no house , none entering in . From the land of Chittim it is revealed to them .
DARBY	Isaiah	23	2	Be still , ye inhabitants of the isle ! The merchants of Sidon , that pass over the sea , have replenished thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	23	3	And on great waters , the seed of Shihor , the harvest of the Nile , was her revenue ; and she was the market of the nations .
DARBY	Isaiah	23	4	Be thou ashamed , Sidon , for the sea hath spoken , the strength of the sea , saying , I have not travailed nor brought forth , neither have I nourished young men [ nor ] brought up virgins .
DARBY	Isaiah	23	5	—When the report came into Egypt , they were sorely pained at the news of Tyre .
DARBY	Isaiah	23	6	Pass over to Tarshish ; howl , ye inhabitants of the coast !
DARBY	Isaiah	23	7	Is this your joyous [ city ] , whose antiquity is of ancient days ? Her feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn .
DARBY	Isaiah	23	8	Who hath purposed this against Tyre , the distributor of crowns , whose merchants were princes , whose dealers were the honourable of the earth ?
DARBY	Isaiah	23	9	Jehovah of hosts hath purposed it , to profane the pride of all glory , to bring to nought all the honourable of the earth .
DARBY	Isaiah	23	10	Overflow thy land like the Nile , daughter of Tarshish : there is no more restraint .
DARBY	Isaiah	23	11	He hath stretched out his hand over the sea , he shaketh the kingdoms . Jehovah hath given a commandment concerning Canaan , to destroy the strongholds thereof ,
DARBY	Isaiah	23	12	and hath said , Thou shalt no more exult , [ thou ] oppressed virgin , daughter of Sidon : get thee up , pass over to Chittim ; even there shalt thou have no rest .
DARBY	Isaiah	23	13	Behold the land of the Chaldeans : this people did not exist ; the Assyrian founded it for the dwellers in the desert : they set up their towers , they destroyed the palaces thereof ; he brought it to ruin .
DARBY	Isaiah	23	14	Howl , ships of Tarshish ! for your fortress is laid waste .
DARBY	Isaiah	23	15	And it shall come to pass in that day , that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years , according to the days of one king . At the end of seventy years it shall be for Tyre as the harlot 's song .
DARBY	Isaiah	23	16	Take a harp , go about the city , thou forgotten harlot ! Make sweet melody , sing many songs , that thou mayest be remembered .
DARBY	Isaiah	23	17	And it shall come to pass at the end of seventy years , that Jehovah will visit Tyre ; and she will return to her hire , and will commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the earth upon the face of the ground .
DARBY	Isaiah	23	18	And her merchandise and her hire shall be holy to Jehovah : it shall not be treasured nor laid up ; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before Jehovah , to eat and be sufficed , and for excellent clothing .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	24	Behold , Jehovah maketh the land empty , and maketh it waste , and turneth it upside down , and scattereth abroad its inhabitants .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	2	And it shall be , as with the people , so with the priest ; as with the servant , so with his master ; as with the maid , so with her mistress ; as with the buyer , so with the seller ; as with the lender , so with the borrower ; as with the taker of usury , so with him from whom usury is taken .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	3	The land shall be utterly emptied , and utterly spoiled ; for Jehovah hath spoken this word .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	4	The land mourneth , it fadeth away ; the world languisheth , it fadeth away : the haughty people of the land do languish .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	5	And the land is polluted under the inhabitants thereof ; for they have violated the laws , changed the statute , broken the everlasting covenant .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	6	Therefore doth the curse devour the earth , and they that dwell therein are held guilty ; therefore the inhabitants of the earth are consumed , and few men are left .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	7	The new wine mourneth , the vine languisheth , all that were merry-hearted do sigh ;
DARBY	Isaiah	24	8	the mirth of tambours ceaseth , the noise of them that rejoice endeth , the joy of the harp ceaseth .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	9	They do not drink wine with a song ; strong drink is bitter to them that drink it .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	10	The city of solitude is broken down ; every house is shut up , so that none entereth in .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	11	There is a crying for wine in the streets ; all joy is darkened , the mirth of the land is gone ;
DARBY	Isaiah	24	12	desolation remaineth in the city , and the gate is smitten , —a ruin .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	13	For so will it be in the midst of the land among the peoples , as the shaking of an olive-tree , as the grape-gleanings when the vintage is done .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	14	These shall lift up their voice , they shall shout for the majesty of Jehovah , they shall cry aloud from the sea .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	15	Therefore glorify Jehovah in the east , the name of Jehovah , the God of Israel , in the isles of the west .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	16	From the end of the earth have we heard songs : Glory to the righteous ! And I said , My leanness , my leanness , woe unto me ! The treacherous have dealt treacherously ; yea , the treacherous have dealt very treacherously .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	17	Fear , and the pit , and the snare are upon thee , inhabitant of the land .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	18	And it shall come to pass , [ that ] he who fleeth from the sound of the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare ; for the windows on high are open , and the foundations of the earth shake .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	19	The earth is utterly broken down , the earth is completely dissolved , the earth is violently moved .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	20	The earth reeleth to and fro like a drunkard , and is shaken like a night hut ; and its transgression is heavy upon it ; and it falleth and shall not rise again .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	21	And it shall come to pass in that day , [ that ] Jehovah will punish the host of the high ones on high , and the kings of the earth upon the earth .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	22	And they shall be brought together , [ as ] an assemblage of prisoners for the pit , and shall be shut up in prison , and after many days shall they be visited .
DARBY	Isaiah	24	23	And the moon shall be confounded , and the sun ashamed ; for Jehovah of hosts shall reign on mount Zion , and in Jerusalem , and before his ancients in glory .
DARBY	Isaiah	25	25	Jehovah , thou art my God : I will exalt thee ; I will celebrate thy name , for thou hast done wonderful things ; counsels of old [ which are ] faithfulness [ and ] truth .
DARBY	Isaiah	25	2	For thou hast made of the city a heap , of the fortified town a ruin , the palace of strangers to be no city ; it shall never be built up .
DARBY	Isaiah	25	3	Therefore shall the mighty people glorify thee , the city of terrible nations shall fear thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	25	4	For thou hast been a fortress to the poor , a fortress for the needy in his distress , a refuge from the storm , a shadow from the heat : for the blast of the terrible ones [ has been ] as the storm [ against ] a wall .
DARBY	Isaiah	25	5	Thou hast subdued the tumult of strangers , as the heat in a dry place ; [ as ] the heat , by the shadow of a cloud , [ so ] the song of the terrible ones is brought low .
DARBY	Isaiah	25	6	And in this mountain will Jehovah of hosts make unto all peoples a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the lees , of fat things full of marrow , of wines on the lees well refined .
DARBY	Isaiah	25	7	And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the veil which veileth all the peoples , and the covering that is spread over all the nations .
DARBY	Isaiah	25	8	He will swallow up death in victory . And the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces ; and the reproach of his people will he take away from off all the earth : for Jehovah hath spoken .
DARBY	Isaiah	25	9	And it shall be said in that day , Behold , this is our God ; we have waited for him , and he will save us : this is Jehovah , we have waited for him ; we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation .
DARBY	Isaiah	25	10	For in this mountain shall the hand of Jehovah rest , and Moab shall be trodden down under him , as straw is trodden down in the dunghill ;
DARBY	Isaiah	25	11	and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them , as he that swimmeth spreadeth them forth to swim ; and he shall bring down their pride together with the plots of their hands .
DARBY	Isaiah	25	12	And the fortress of the high defences of thy walls will he bring down , lay low , bring to the ground , into the dust .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	26	In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah : We have a strong city ; salvation doth he appoint for walls and bulwarks .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	2	Open ye the gates , and the righteous nation which keepeth faithfulness shall enter in .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	3	Thou wilt keep in perfect peace the mind stayed [ on thee ] , for he confideth in thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	4	Confide ye in Jehovah for ever ; for in Jah , Jehovah , is the rock of ages .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	5	For he bringeth down them that dwell on high ; the lofty city , he layeth it low , he layeth it low to the ground , he bringeth it even to the dust .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	6	The foot shall tread it down , —the feet of the afflicted , the steps of the poor .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	7	The way of the just is uprightness : thou , the Upright , dost make the path of the just even .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	8	Yea , in the way of thy judgments , O Jehovah , have we waited for thee ; the desire of [ our ] soul is to thy name , and to thy memorial .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	9	With my soul have I desired thee in the night ; yea , with my spirit within me I seek thee early : for when thy judgments are in the earth , the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	10	If favour be shewn to the wicked , he doth not learn righteousness : in the land of uprightness he dealeth unjustly , and beholdeth not the majesty of Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	11	Jehovah , thy hand is lifted up , but they do not see : [ yet ] they shall see [ thy ] jealousy [ for ] the people , and be ashamed ; yea , the fire which is for thine adversaries shall devour them .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	12	Jehovah , thou wilt ordain peace for us ; for thou also hast wrought all our works for us .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	13	Jehovah our God , other lords than thee have had dominion over us ; by thee only will we make mention of thy name .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	14	[ They are ] dead , they shall not live ; deceased , they shall not rise : for thou hast visited and destroyed them , and made all memory of them to perish .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	15	Thou hast increased the nation , Jehovah , thou hast increased the nation : thou art glorified . Thou hadst removed [ it ] far [ unto ] all the ends of the earth .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	16	Jehovah , in trouble they sought thee ; they poured out [ their ] whispered prayer when thy chastening was upon them .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	17	As a woman with child , that draweth near her delivery , is in travail , [ and ] crieth out in her pangs ; so have we been before thee , Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	18	We have been with child , we have been in travail , we have as it were brought forth wind ; we have not wrought the deliverance of the land , neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	19	Thy dead shall live , my dead bodies shall arise . Awake and sing in triumph , ye that dwell in dust ; for thy dew is the dew of the morning , and the earth shall cast forth the dead .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	20	Come , my people , enter into thy chambers , and shut thy doors about thee ; hide thyself just for a little moment , until the indignation be past .
DARBY	Isaiah	26	21	For behold , Jehovah cometh out of his place to visit the iniquity of the inhabitants of the earth upon them ; and the earth shall disclose her blood , and shall no more cover her slain .
DARBY	Isaiah	27	27	In that day Jehovah , with his sore and great and strong sword , will visit leviathan the fleeing serpent , and leviathan the crooked serpent ; and he will slay the monster that is in the sea .
DARBY	Isaiah	27	2	In that day [ there shall be ] a vineyard of pure wine ; sing concerning it :
DARBY	Isaiah	27	3	I Jehovah keep it , I will water it every moment ; lest any harm it , I will keep it night and day .
DARBY	Isaiah	27	4	Fury is not in me . Oh that I had briars [ and ] thorns in battle against me ! I would march against them , I would burn them together .
DARBY	Isaiah	27	5	Or let him take hold of my strength ; let him make peace with me : [ yea , ] let him make peace with me .
DARBY	Isaiah	27	6	In the future Jacob shall take root ; Israel shall blossom and bud , and they shall fill the face of the world with fruit .
DARBY	Isaiah	27	7	Hath he smitten him according to the smiting of those that smote him ? Is he slain according to the slaughter of those slain by him ?
DARBY	Isaiah	27	8	In measure , when sending her away , didst thou contend with her : he hath taken [ her ] away with his rough wind in the day of the east wind .
DARBY	Isaiah	27	9	By this , therefore , shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged ; and this is all the fruit of the taking away of his sin : when he shall make all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are crumbled in pieces , —the Asherahs and the sun-images shall not stand .
DARBY	Isaiah	27	10	For the fortified city is solitary , a habitation abandoned and forsaken like a wilderness ; there shall the calf feed , and there shall he lie down , and consume its boughs .
DARBY	Isaiah	27	11	When its branches are withered they shall be broken off ; women shall come [ and ] set them on fire . For it is a people of no intelligence ; therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them , and he who formed them will shew them no favour .
DARBY	Isaiah	27	12	And it shall come to pass in that day , that Jehovah shall beat out from the flood of the river unto the torrent of Egypt , and ye shall be gathered one by one , [ ye ] children of Israel .
DARBY	Isaiah	27	13	And it shall come to pass in that day , [ that ] the great trumpet shall be blown ; and they shall come that were perishing in the land of Assyria , and the outcasts in the land of Egypt , and they shall worship Jehovah in the holy mountain at Jerusalem .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	28	Bread [ corn ] is crushed , because he will not ever be threshing it ; and if he drove the wheels of his cart and his horses [ over it ] , he would not crush it .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	2	Behold , the Lord hath a mighty and strong one , as a storm of hail [ and ] a destroying tempest ; as a storm of mighty waters overflowing , shall he cast down to the earth with might .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	3	The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under feet ;
DARBY	Isaiah	28	4	and the fading flower of his glorious adornment which is on the head of the fat valley shall be like an early fig before the summer : as soon as he that seeth it perceiveth it , scarcely is it in his hand , he swalloweth it down .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	5	In that day will Jehovah of hosts be for a crown of glory , and for a diadem of beauty , unto the remnant of his people ;
DARBY	Isaiah	28	6	and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment , and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	7	But these also have erred through wine , and through strong drink are they gone astray . The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink ; they are overpowered by wine , they are gone astray through strong drink ; they have erred in vision , they have stumbled [ in ] judgment .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	8	For all tables are full of filthy vomit , so that there is no [ more ] place .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	9	Whom shall he teach knowledge ? and whom shall he make to understand the report ? Them that are weaned from the milk , withdrawn from the breasts ?
DARBY	Isaiah	28	10	For [ it is ] precept upon precept , precept upon precept ; line upon line , line upon line ; here a little , there a little . …
DARBY	Isaiah	28	11	For with stammering lips and a strange tongue will he speak to this people ;
DARBY	Isaiah	28	12	to whom he said , This is the rest : cause the weary to rest ; and this is the refreshing . But they would not hear .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	13	And the word of Jehovah was unto them precept upon precept , precept upon precept , line upon line , line upon line , here a little , there a little : that they might go , and fall backward , and be broken , and snared , and taken .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	14	Therefore hear the word of Jehovah , ye scornful men , that rule this people which is in Jerusalem .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	15	For ye have said , We have made a covenant with death , and with Sheol have we made an agreement ; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through , it shall not come unto us ; for we have made lies our refuge , and under falsehood have we hid ourselves .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	16	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I lay for foundation in Zion a stone , a tried stone , a precious corner-stone , a sure foundation : he that trusteth shall not make haste .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	17	And I will appoint judgment for a line , and righteousness for a plummet ; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies , and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	18	And your covenant with death shall be annulled , and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand ; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through , ye shall be trodden down by it .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	19	As it passeth through it shall take you ; for morning by morning shall it pass through , by day and by night ; and it shall be terror only to understand the report .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	20	For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on , and the covering too narrow when he would wrap himself in it .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	21	For Jehovah will rise up as on mount Perazim , he will be moved with anger as in the valley of Gibeon ; that he may do his work , his strange work , and perform his act , his unwonted act .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	22	Now therefore be ye not scorners , lest your bonds be made strong ; for I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of hosts a consumption , and [ one ] determined , upon the whole land .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	23	Give ear , and hear my voice ; hearken , and hear my speech .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	24	Doth the ploughman plough all day to sow ? Is he [ all day ] opening and breaking the clods of his land ?
DARBY	Isaiah	28	25	Doth he not , when he hath levelled the face thereof , cast abroad dill , and scatter cummin , and set the wheat in rows , and the barley in an appointed place , and the rye in its border ?
DARBY	Isaiah	28	26	His God doth instruct him in [ his ] judgment , he doth teach him .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	27	For the dill is not threshed with a threshing instrument , neither is a cart-wheel turned about upon the cummin ; but dill is beaten out with a staff , and cummin with a rod .
DARBY	Isaiah	28	29	This also cometh forth from Jehovah of hosts ; he is wonderful in counsel , great in wisdom .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	29	Woe to Ariel , to Ariel , the city of David 's encampment ! Add ye year to year ; let the feasts come round .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	2	But I will distress Ariel , and there shall be sorrow and sadness ; and it shall be unto me as an Ariel .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	3	And I will camp against thee round about , and will lay siege against thee with watch-posts , and I will raise forts against thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	4	And thou shalt be brought low , thou shalt speak out of the ground , and thy speech shall come low out of the dust , and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit , out of the ground , and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	5	And the multitude of thine enemies shall be like small dust , and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passeth away ; and it shall be in an instant , suddenly .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	6	Thou shalt be visited by Jehovah of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise , with whirlwind and tempest , and the flame of devouring fire .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	7	And the multitude of all the nations that war against Ariel , even all that war against her and her fortifications , and that distress her , shall be as a dream of a night vision .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	8	It shall even be as when the hungry dreameth , and , behold , he eateth ; and he awaketh , and his soul is empty ; or as when the thirsty dreameth , and , behold , he drinketh ; and he awaketh , and , behold , he is faint , and his soul craveth : so shall the multitude of all the nations be that war against mount Zion .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	9	Be astounded and astonished , blind yourselves and be blind ! They are drunken , but not with wine ; they stagger , but not with strong drink .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	10	For Jehovah hath poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep , and hath closed your eyes ; the prophets and your chiefs , the seers , hath he covered .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	11	And the whole vision is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed , which they give to one that can read , saying , Read this , I pray thee ; and he saith , I can not , for it is sealed .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	12	And they give the book to him that can not read , saying , Read this , I pray thee ; and he saith , I can not read .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	13	And the Lord saith , Forasmuch as this people draw near with their mouth , and honour me with their lips , but their heart is removed far from me , and their fear of me is a commandment taught of men ;
DARBY	Isaiah	29	14	therefore , behold , I will proceed to do marvellously with this people , to do marvellously , even with wonder , and the wisdom of their wise [ men ] shall perish , and the understanding of their intelligent ones shall be hid .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	15	Woe unto them that hide deep , far from Jehovah , their counsel ! And their works are in the dark , and they say , Who seeth us ? and who knoweth us ?
DARBY	Isaiah	29	16	[ Oh ] your perverseness ! —Shall the potter be esteemed as the clay , so that the work should say of him that made it , He made me not ; or the thing formed say of him that formed it , He hath no understanding ?
DARBY	Isaiah	29	17	Is it not yet a very little while , and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest ?
DARBY	Isaiah	29	18	And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book , and , out of obscurity and out of darkness , the eyes of the blind shall see ;
DARBY	Isaiah	29	19	and the meek shall increase their joy in Jehovah , and the needy among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	20	For the terrible one shall come to nought , and the scorner shall be no more , and all that watch for iniquity shall be cut off ,
DARBY	Isaiah	29	21	that make a man an offender for a word , and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate , and pervert [ the judgment of ] the righteous by futility .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	22	Therefore thus saith Jehovah who redeemed Abraham , concerning the house of Jacob : Jacob shall not now be ashamed , neither shall his face now be pale ;
DARBY	Isaiah	29	23	for when he seeth his children , the work of my hands , in the midst of him , they shall hallow my name , and hallow the Holy One of Jacob , and shall fear the God of Israel .
DARBY	Isaiah	29	24	And they that are of erring spirit shall know understanding , and the disobedient shall learn doctrine .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	30	And Jehovah will cause the majesty of his voice to be heard , and will shew the lighting down of his arm with indignation of anger , and a flame of consuming fire , with waterflood and storm and hailstones .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	2	who walk to go down into Egypt , and have not asked of my mouth , —to take refuge under the protection of Pharaoh , and trust in the shadow of Egypt !
DARBY	Isaiah	30	3	For to you the protection of Pharaoh shall be a shame , and the trust in the shadow of Egypt a confusion .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	4	For his princes were at Zoan , and his ambassadors came to Hanes .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	5	They were all ashamed of a people [ that ] did not profit them , nor were a help or profit , but a shame , and also a reproach .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	6	—The burden of the beasts of the south : Through a land of trouble and anguish , whence come the lioness and lion , the viper and fiery flying serpent , they carry their riches upon the shoulders of asses , and their treasures upon the bunches of camels , to the people that shall not profit [ them ] .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	7	For Egypt shall help in vain , and to no purpose ; therefore have I named her , Arrogance , that doeth nothing .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	8	Now go , write it before them on a tablet , and record it in a book , that it may be for the time to come , as a witness for ever ,
DARBY	Isaiah	30	9	that this is a rebellious people , lying children , children that will not hear the law of Jehovah ;
DARBY	Isaiah	30	10	who say to the seers , See not ; and to the prophets , Prophesy not unto us right things ; speak unto us smooth things , prophesy deceits ;
DARBY	Isaiah	30	11	get you out of the way , turn aside out of the path , cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us !
DARBY	Isaiah	30	12	Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel : Because ye reject this word , and confide in oppression and wilfulness , and depend thereon ,
DARBY	Isaiah	30	13	therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall , swelling out in a towering wall , whose breaking shall come suddenly in an instant .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	14	And he shall break it as the breaking of a potter 's vessel , that is broken in pieces unsparingly ; and in the pieces of it there shall not be found a sherd to take fire from the hearth , or to scoop water out of the cistern .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	15	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah , the Holy One of Israel : In returning and rest shall ye be saved , in quietness and confidence shall be your strength ; but ye would not .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	16	And ye said , No , but we will flee upon horses , —therefore shall ye flee ; and , We will ride upon the swift , —therefore shall they that pursue you be swift .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	17	One thousand [ shall flee ] at the rebuke of one ; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee : till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain , and as a banner on a hill .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	18	And therefore will Jehovah wait , that he may be gracious unto you , and therefore will he lift himself up , that he may have mercy upon you ; for Jehovah is a God of judgment : blessed are all they that wait for him .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	19	For the people shall dwell in Zion , at Jerusalem . Thou shalt weep no more ; he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry ; as he heareth it , he will answer thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	20	And the Lord will give you the bread of adversity , and the water of oppression ; yet thy teachers shall not be hidden any more , but thine eyes shall see thy teachers .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	21	And when ye turn to the right hand or when ye turn to the left , thine ears shall hear a word behind thee , saying , This is the way , walk ye in it .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	22	And ye shall defile the silver covering of your graven images , and the gold overlaying of your molten images ; thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth : Out ! shalt thou say unto it .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	23	And he will give the rain of thy seed with which thou shalt sow the ground ; and bread , the produce of the ground , and it shall be fat and rich . In that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures ;
DARBY	Isaiah	30	24	and the oxen and the asses that till the ground shall eat salted provender , which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	25	And there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every hill that is lifted up , brooks [ and ] water-courses , in the day of the great slaughter , when the towers fall .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	26	And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun , and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold , as the light of seven days , in the day that Jehovah bindeth up the breach of his people , and healeth the wound of their stroke .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	27	Behold , the name of Jehovah cometh from far , burning [ with ] his anger—a grievous conflagration ; his lips are full of indignation , and his tongue as a consuming fire ;
DARBY	Isaiah	30	28	and his breath as an overflowing torrent , which reacheth even to the neck , to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction , and [ to put ] a bridle into the jaws of the peoples , that causeth them to go astray .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	29	Ye shall have a song , as in the night when a feast is sanctified ; and joy of heart , as of one who goeth with a pipe to come unto the mountain of Jehovah , to the Rock of Israel .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	31	For through the voice of Jehovah shall the Assyrian be broken down : he will smite [ him ] with the rod .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	32	And wherever shall pass the appointed staff , which Jehovah shall lay upon him , it shall be with tambours and harps ; and with tumultuous battles will he fight with it .
DARBY	Isaiah	30	33	For Topheth is prepared of old ; for the king also it is prepared : he hath made it deep and large ; its pile is fire and much wood ; the breath of Jehovah , like a stream of brimstone , doth kindle it .
DARBY	Isaiah	31	31	Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help , and depend on horses , and confide in chariots because [ they are ] many , and in horsemen because they are very strong ; and who look not unto the Holy One of Israel , neither seek Jehovah !
DARBY	Isaiah	31	2	But he also is wise , and he bringeth evil , and recalleth not his words ; and he will arise against the house of evildoers , and against the help of workers of iniquity .
DARBY	Isaiah	31	3	And the Egyptians are men , and not God , and their horses flesh , and not spirit ; and Jehovah shall stretch forth his hand , and he that helpeth shall stumble , and he that is helped shall fall , and they all shall perish together .
DARBY	Isaiah	31	4	For thus hath Jehovah said unto me : Like as the lion and the young lion growling over his prey , when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him , is not afraid of their voice , nor giveth way before the multitude of them ; so will Jehovah of hosts come down to war upon mount Zion , and on the hill thereof .
DARBY	Isaiah	31	5	As birds with outstretched wings , so will Jehovah of hosts cover Jerusalem ; covering , he will also deliver , passing over , he will rescue [ it ] .
DARBY	Isaiah	31	6	Turn unto him from whom ye have deeply revolted , ye children of Israel ;
DARBY	Isaiah	31	7	for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold , which your sinful hands have made unto you .
DARBY	Isaiah	31	8	And Asshur shall fall by the sword , not of a great man ; and the sword , not of a mean man , shall devour him : and he shall flee from the sword , and his young men shall become tributary ;
DARBY	Isaiah	31	9	and for fear , he shall pass over to his rock , and his princes shall be afraid of the banner , saith Jehovah , whose fire is in Zion , and his furnace in Jerusalem .
DARBY	Isaiah	32	32	Behold , a king shall reign in righteousness , and princes shall rule in judgment .
DARBY	Isaiah	32	2	And a man shall be as a hiding-place from the wind , and a covert from the storm ; as brooks of water in a dry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land .
DARBY	Isaiah	32	3	And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim , and the ears of them that hear shall hearken ;
DARBY	Isaiah	32	4	and the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge , and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly .
DARBY	Isaiah	32	5	The vile man shall be no more called noble , nor the churl said to be bountiful :
DARBY	Isaiah	32	6	for the vile man will speak villainy , and his heart will work iniquity , to practise hypocrisy , and to utter error against Jehovah , to make empty the soul of the hungry , and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail .
DARBY	Isaiah	32	7	The instruments also of the churl are evil : he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the meek with lying words , even when the needy speaketh right .
DARBY	Isaiah	32	8	But the noble deviseth noble things ; and to noble things doth he stand .
DARBY	Isaiah	32	9	Rise up , ye women that are at ease , hear my voice ; ye careless daughters , give ear unto my speech .
DARBY	Isaiah	32	10	In a year and [ some ] days shall ye be troubled , ye careless women ; for the vintage shall fail , the ingathering shall not come .
DARBY	Isaiah	32	11	Tremble , ye women that are at ease ; be troubled , ye careless ones ; strip you , and make you bare , and gird [ sackcloth ] on your loins !
DARBY	Isaiah	32	12	They shall smite on the breasts [ in lamentation ] for the pleasant fields , for the fruitful vineyards .
DARBY	Isaiah	32	13	Upon the land of my people shall come up thistles [ and ] briars , yea , upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city .
DARBY	Isaiah	32	14	For the palace shall be deserted , the multitude of the city shall be forsaken ; hill and watchtower shall be caves for ever , a joy of wild asses , a pasture of flocks ;
DARBY	Isaiah	32	15	until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high , and the wilderness become a fruitful field , and the fruitful field be counted for a forest .
DARBY	Isaiah	32	16	And judgment shall inhabit the wilderness , and righteousness dwell in the fruitful field .
DARBY	Isaiah	32	17	And the work of righteousness shall be peace ; and the effect of righteousness , quietness and assurance for ever .
DARBY	Isaiah	32	18	And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation , and in sure dwellings , and in quiet resting-places .
DARBY	Isaiah	32	19	And it shall hail , coming down on the forest ; and the city shall be low in a low place .
DARBY	Isaiah	32	20	Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters , that send forth the feet of the ox and the ass .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	33	Woe to thee that spoilest , and thou wast not spoiled ; and that dealest treacherously , and they dealt not treacherously with thee ! When thou shalt cease to spoil , thou shalt be spoiled ; when thou shalt make an end of dealing treacherously , they shall deal treacherously with thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	2	Jehovah , be gracious unto us ; we have waited for thee : be their arm every morning , yea , our salvation in the time of trouble .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	3	At the noise of the tumult the peoples fled ; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	4	And your spoil shall be gathered [ like ] the gathering of the caterpillar : as the running of locusts shall they run upon it .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	5	Jehovah is exalted ; for he dwelleth on high : he hath filled Zion with justice and righteousness ;
DARBY	Isaiah	33	6	and he shall be the stability of thy times , the riches of salvation , wisdom and knowledge : the fear of Jehovah shall be your treasure .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	7	Behold , their valiant ones cry without ; the messengers of peace weep bitterly .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	8	The highways are desolate , the wayfaring man ceaseth . He hath broken the covenant , he hath despised the cities , he regardeth no man .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	9	The land mourneth , it languisheth ; Lebanon is ashamed , is withered ; the Sharon is become as a desert , and Bashan and Carmel are stripped .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	10	Now will I arise , saith Jehovah ; now will I be exalted , now will I lift up myself .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	11	Ye shall conceive dry grass , ye shall bring forth stubble : your breath shall devour you [ as ] fire .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	12	And the peoples shall be [ as ] burnings of lime , [ as ] thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	13	Hear , ye that are far off , what I have done ; and ye that are near , acknowledge my might .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	14	The sinners in Zion are afraid ; trembling hath surprised the hypocrites : Who among us shall dwell with the consuming fire ? who among us shall dwell with everlasting flames ?
DARBY	Isaiah	33	15	—He that walketh righteously , and speaketh uprightly ; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions , that shaketh his hands from taking hold of bribes , that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood , and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil :
DARBY	Isaiah	33	16	he shall dwell on high , the fortresses of the rocks shall be his high retreat ; bread shall be given him , his water shall be sure .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	17	Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty ; they shall behold the land that is far off .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	18	Thy heart shall meditate on terror : Where is the scribe ? where is the receiver ? where is he that counted the towers ?
DARBY	Isaiah	33	19	Thou shalt no more see the fierce people , a people of a deeper speech than thou canst comprehend , of a stammering tongue that can not be understood .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	20	Look upon Zion , the city of our solemnities : thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation , a tent that shall not be removed , the stakes whereof shall never be pulled up , neither shall any of its cords be broken ;
DARBY	Isaiah	33	21	but there Jehovah is unto us glorious , —a place of rivers , of broad streams : no galley with oars shall go there , neither shall gallant ship pass thereby .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	22	For Jehovah is our judge , Jehovah , our lawgiver , Jehovah , our king : he will save us .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	23	Thy tacklings are loosed ; they strengthen not the socket of their mast , they can not spread the sail : then is the prey of a great spoil divided ; the lame take the prey .
DARBY	Isaiah	33	24	And the inhabitant shall not say , I am sick : the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven [ their ] iniquity .
DARBY	Isaiah	34	34	Come near , ye nations , to hear ; and hearken , ye peoples : let the earth hear , and all its fulness ; the world , and all that cometh forth of it .
DARBY	Isaiah	34	2	For the wrath of Jehovah is against all the nations , and [ his ] fury against all their armies : he hath devoted them to destruction , he hath delivered them to the slaughter .
DARBY	Isaiah	34	3	And their slain shall be cast out , and their stink shall come up from their carcases , and the mountains shall be melted with their blood .
DARBY	Isaiah	34	4	And all the host of the heavens shall be dissolved , and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll ; and all their host shall fade away , as a leaf fadeth from off the vine , and as the withered [ fruit ] from the fig-tree .
DARBY	Isaiah	34	5	For my sword is bathed in the heavens ; behold , it shall come down upon Edom , and upon the people of my ban , to judgment .
DARBY	Isaiah	34	6	The sword of Jehovah is filled with blood , it is made fat with fatness , with the blood of lambs and goats , with the fat of the kidneys of rams ; for Jehovah hath a sacrifice in Bozrah , and a great slaughter in the land of Edom .
DARBY	Isaiah	34	7	And the buffaloes shall come down with them , and the bullocks with the bulls ; and their land shall be soaked with blood , and their dust made fat with fatness .
DARBY	Isaiah	34	8	For it is the day of Jehovah 's vengeance , the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion .
DARBY	Isaiah	34	9	And the torrents thereof shall be turned into pitch , and its dust into brimstone ; yea , the land thereof shall become burning pitch :
DARBY	Isaiah	34	10	it shall not be quenched night nor day ; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever : from generation to generation it shall lie waste ; none shall pass through it for ever and ever .
DARBY	Isaiah	34	11	And the pelican and the bittern shall possess it , and the great owl and the raven shall dwell in it . And he shall stretch out upon it the line of waste , and the plummets of emptiness .
DARBY	Isaiah	34	12	Of her nobles who should proclaim the kingdom , none are there ; and all her princes shall be nought .
DARBY	Isaiah	34	13	And thorns shall come up in her palaces , nettles and brambles in her fortresses ; and it shall be a dwelling-place of wild dogs , a court for ostriches .
DARBY	Isaiah	34	14	And there shall the beasts of the desert meet with the jackals , and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow ; the lilith also shall settle there , and find for herself a place of rest .
DARBY	Isaiah	34	15	There shall the arrow-snake make her nest , and lay , and hatch , and gather under her shadow ; there also shall the vultures be gathered one with another .
DARBY	Isaiah	34	16	Search ye in the book of Jehovah and read : not one of these shall fail , one shall not have to seek for the other ; for my mouth , it hath commanded , and his Spirit , it hath gathered them .
DARBY	Isaiah	34	17	For he himself hath cast the lot for them , and his hand hath divided it unto them with the line : they shall possess it for ever ; from generation to generation shall they dwell therein .
DARBY	Isaiah	35	35	The wilderness and the dry land shall be gladdened ; and the desert shall rejoice , and blossom as the rose .
DARBY	Isaiah	35	2	It shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and shouting : the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it , the excellency of Carmel and Sharon . They shall see the glory of Jehovah , the excellency of our God .
DARBY	Isaiah	35	3	Strengthen the weak hands and confirm the tottering knees .
DARBY	Isaiah	35	4	Say to them that are of a timid heart , Be strong , fear not ; behold your God : vengeance cometh , the recompense of God ! He will come himself , and save you .
DARBY	Isaiah	35	5	Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened , and the ears of the deaf be unstopped ;
DARBY	Isaiah	35	6	then shall the lame [ man ] leap as a hart , and the tongue of the dumb sing : for in the wilderness shall waters break out , and torrents in the desert .
DARBY	Isaiah	35	7	And the mirage shall become a pool , and the thirsty land springs of water : in the habitation of wild dogs , where they lay down , shall be grass with reeds and rushes .
DARBY	Isaiah	35	8	And a highway shall be there and a way , and it shall be called , The way of holiness : the unclean shall not pass through it ; but it shall be for these . Those that go [ this ] way—even fools , —shall not err [ therein ] .
DARBY	Isaiah	35	9	No lion shall be there , nor shall ravenous beast go up thereon , nor be found there ; but the redeemed shall walk [ there ] .
DARBY	Isaiah	35	10	And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return , and come to Zion with singing ; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads : they shall obtain gladness and joy , and sorrow and sighing shall flee away .
DARBY	Isaiah	36	36	And it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah , that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah , and took them .
DARBY	Isaiah	36	2	And the king of Assyria sent Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem , to king Hezekiah , with a strong force . And he stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool , on the highway of the fuller 's field .
DARBY	Isaiah	36	3	Then came forth to him Eliakim the son of Hilkijah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph , the chronicler .
DARBY	Isaiah	36	4	And Rab-shakeh said to them , Say now to Hezekiah , Thus says the great king , the king of Assyria : What confidence is this in which thou trustest ?
DARBY	Isaiah	36	5	Thou sayest , but it is a word of the lips , [ There is ] counsel and strength for war . Now on whom dost thou rely , that thou hast revolted against me ?
DARBY	Isaiah	36	6	Behold , thou reliest upon the staff of that broken reed , upon Egypt , on which if a man lean , it goes into his hand , and pierces it : so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that rely upon him .
DARBY	Isaiah	36	7	And if thou say to me , We rely upon Jehovah our God : is it not he , whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has removed , saying to Judah and Jerusalem , Ye shall worship before this altar ?
DARBY	Isaiah	36	8	And now engage , I pray thee , with my master the king of Assyria , and I will give thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them .
DARBY	Isaiah	36	9	How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants ? And thou reliest upon Egypt for chariots and for horsemen !
DARBY	Isaiah	36	10	And now am I come up without Jehovah against this land to destroy it ? Jehovah said to me , Go up against this land and destroy it .
DARBY	Isaiah	36	11	And Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to Rab-shakeh , Speak , we pray thee , to thy servants in Syriac , for we understand it ; and speak not to us in the Jewish [ language ] in the ears of the people that are upon the wall .
DARBY	Isaiah	36	12	And Rab-shakeh said , Is it to thy master and to thee that my master sent me to speak these words ? Is it not to the men that sit on the wall , that they may eat their own dung , and drink their own urine with you ?
DARBY	Isaiah	36	13	And Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish [ language ] , and said , Hear the words of the great king , the king of Assyria !
DARBY	Isaiah	36	14	Thus says the king : Let not Hezekiah deceive you ; for he will not be able to deliver you .
DARBY	Isaiah	36	15	Neither let Hezekiah make you rely upon Jehovah , saying , Jehovah will certainly deliver us ; this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria .
DARBY	Isaiah	36	16	Hearken not to Hezekiah ; for thus says the king of Assyria : Make peace with me and come out to me ; and eat every one of his vine , and every one of his fig-tree , and drink every one the waters of his own cistern ;
DARBY	Isaiah	36	17	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land , a land of corn and wine , a land of bread and vineyards .
DARBY	Isaiah	36	18	Let not Hezekiah persuade you , saying , Jehovah will deliver us . Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
DARBY	Isaiah	36	19	Where are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad ? where are the gods of Sepharvaim ? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand ?
DARBY	Isaiah	36	20	Who are they among all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand , that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ?
DARBY	Isaiah	36	21	And they were silent , and answered him not a word ; for the king 's command was , saying , Answer him not .
DARBY	Isaiah	36	22	And Eliakim the son of Hilkijah , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph , the chronicler , came to Hezekiah , with their garments rent , and told him the words of Rab-shakeh .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	37	And Sennacherib king of Assyria departed , and went and returned , and abode at Nineveh .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	2	And he sent Eliakim , who was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and the elders of the priests , covered with sackcloth , to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	3	And they said to him , Thus says Hezekiah : This day is a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and of reviling ; for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	4	It may be Jehovah thy God will hear the words of Rab-shakeh , whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God , and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God hath heard . Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that is left .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	5	And the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	6	And Isaiah said to them , Thus shall ye say to your master , Thus saith Jehovah : Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard , wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	7	Behold , I will put a spirit into him , and he shall hear tidings , and shall return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	8	And Rab-shakeh returned , and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah ; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	9	And he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , He has come forth to make war with thee . And when he heard [ it ] , he sent messengers to Hezekiah , saying ,
DARBY	Isaiah	37	10	Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying : Let not thy God , upon whom thou reliest , deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	11	Behold , thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all countries , destroying them utterly ; and shalt thou be delivered ?
DARBY	Isaiah	37	12	Have the gods of the nations which my fathers have destroyed delivered them , Gozan , and Haran , and Rezeph , and the children of Eden that were in Thelassar ?
DARBY	Isaiah	37	13	Where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arpad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivvah ?
DARBY	Isaiah	37	14	And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it ; and Hezekiah went up into the house of Jehovah , and spread it before Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	15	And Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah , saying ,
DARBY	Isaiah	37	16	Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel , who sittest [ between ] the cherubim , thou , the Same , thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth : thou hast made the heavens and the earth .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	17	Incline thine ear , O Jehovah , and hear ; open , Jehovah , thine eyes , and see ; and hear all the words of Sennacherib , who hath sent to reproach the living God .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	18	Of a truth , Jehovah , the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the lands , and their countries ,
DARBY	Isaiah	37	19	and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone ; and they have destroyed them .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	20	And now , Jehovah our God , save us out of his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art Jehovah , thou only .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	21	And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah , saying , Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel , Whereas thou hast prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria ,
DARBY	Isaiah	37	22	this is the word which Jehovah hath spoken against him : The virgin-daughter of Zion despiseth thee , laugheth thee to scorn ; the daughter of Jerusalem shaketh her head at thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	23	Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed ? and against whom hast thou exalted the voice ? Against the Holy One of Israel hast thou lifted up thine eyes on high .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	24	By thy servants thou hast reproached the Lord , and hast said , With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains , to the recesses of Lebanon ; and I will cut down its tall cedars , the choice of its cypresses ; and I will enter into its furthest height , [ into ] the forest of its fruitful field .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	25	I have digged and drunk water ; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the streams of Matsor .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	26	Hast thou not heard that long ago I did it , and that from ancient days I formed it ? Now have I brought it to pass , that thou shouldest lay waste fortified cities [ into ] ruinous heaps .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	27	And their inhabitants were powerless , they were dismayed and put to shame ; they were [ as ] the grass of the field and the green herb , [ as ] the grass on the housetops , and grain blighted before it be grown up .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	28	But I know thine abode , and thy going out , and thy coming in , and thy raging against me .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	29	Because thy raging against me and thine arrogance is come up into mine ears , I will put my ring in thy nose , and my bridle in thy lips , and I will make thee go back by the way by which thou camest .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	30	And this [ shall be ] the sign unto thee : there shall be eaten this year such as groweth of itself ; and in the second year that which springeth of the same ; but in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	31	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward , and bear fruit upward ;
DARBY	Isaiah	37	32	for out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and out of mount Zion they that escape : the zeal of Jehovah of hosts shall do this .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	33	Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria : He shall not come into this city , nor shoot an arrow there , nor come before it with shield , nor cast a bank against it .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	34	By the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and shall not come into this city , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	35	And I will defend this city , to save it , for mine own sake , and for my servant David 's sake .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	36	And an angel of Jehovah went forth , and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand . And when they arose early in the morning , behold , they were all dead bodies .
DARBY	Isaiah	37	38	And it came to pass , as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword ; and they escaped into the land of Ararat . And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	38	In those days Hezekiah was sick unto death . And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him , and said to him , Thus saith Jehovah : Set thy house in order ; for thou shalt die , and not live .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	2	And Hezekiah turned his face to the wall , and prayed to Jehovah ,
DARBY	Isaiah	38	3	and said , Ah , Jehovah , remember , I beseech thee , how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in thy sight . And Hezekiah wept much .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	4	And the word of Jehovah came to Isaiah , saying ,
DARBY	Isaiah	38	5	Go and say to Hezekiah , Thus saith Jehovah , the God of David thy father : I have heard thy prayer , I have seen thy tears : behold , I will add to thy days fifteen years .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	6	And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria , and I will defend this city .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	7	And this [ shall be ] the sign to thee from Jehovah , that Jehovah will do this thing that he hath spoken :
DARBY	Isaiah	38	8	behold , I will bring again the shadow of the degrees which hath gone down with the sun on the dial of Ahaz , ten degrees backward . So the sun returned on the dial ten degrees , by which it had gone down .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	9	The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah , when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness :
DARBY	Isaiah	38	10	I said , In the meridian of my days I shall go to the gates of Sheol : I am deprived of the rest of my years .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	11	I said , I shall not see Jah , Jah in the land of the living . With those who dwell where all has ceased to be , I shall behold man no more .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	12	Mine age is departed , and is removed from me as a shepherd 's tent . I have cut off like a weaver my life . He separateth me from the thrum : —from day to night thou wilt make an end of me .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	13	I kept still until the morning ; … as a lion , so doth he break all my bones . From day to night thou wilt make an end of me .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	14	Like a swallow [ or ] a crane , so did I chatter ; I mourned as a dove ; mine eyes failed [ with looking ] upward : Lord , I am oppressed ; undertake for me .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	15	What shall I say ? He hath both spoken unto me , and himself hath done [ it ] . I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	16	Lord , by these things [ men ] live , and in all these things is the life of my spirit ; and thou hast recovered me , and made me to live .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	17	Behold , instead of peace I had bitterness upon bitterness ; but thou hast in love delivered my soul from the pit of destruction ; for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	18	For not Sheol shall praise thee , nor death celebrate thee ; they that go down into the pit do not hope for thy truth .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	19	The living , the living , he shall praise thee , as I this day : the father to the children shall make known thy truth .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	20	Jehovah was [ purposed ] to save me.—And we will play upon my stringed instruments all the days of our life , in the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	21	Now Isaiah had said , Let them take a cake of figs , and lay it for a plaster upon the boil , and he shall recover .
DARBY	Isaiah	38	22	And Hezekiah had said , What is the sign that I shall go up into the house of Jehovah ?
DARBY	Isaiah	39	39	At that time Merodach-Baladan , the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent a letter and a present to Hezekiah ; for he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered .
DARBY	Isaiah	39	2	And Hezekiah was glad of them , and shewed them the house of his precious things , the silver and the gold , and the spices and the fine oil , and all the house of his armour , and all that was found amongst his treasures : there was nothing in his house , nor in all his dominion , that Hezekiah did not shew them .
DARBY	Isaiah	39	3	Then came the prophet Isaiah to king Hezekiah , and said to him , What said these men ? and from whence came they to thee ? And Hezekiah said , They came from a far country to me , from Babylon .
DARBY	Isaiah	39	4	And he said , What have they seen in thy house ? And Hezekiah said , All that is in my house have they seen : there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewn them .
DARBY	Isaiah	39	5	And Isaiah said to Hezekiah , Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts :
DARBY	Isaiah	39	6	Behold , days come when all that is in thy house , and that which thy fathers have laid up until this day , shall be carried to Babylon : nothing shall be left , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	39	7	And of thy sons that shall issue from thee , whom thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .
DARBY	Isaiah	39	8	And Hezekiah said to Isaiah , Good is the word of Jehovah which thou hast spoken . And he said , For there shall be peace and truth in my days .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	40	Comfort ye , comfort ye my people , saith your God .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	2	Speak to the heart of Jerusalem , and cry unto her , that her time of suffering is accomplished , that her iniquity is pardoned ; for she hath received of Jehovah 's hand double for all her sins .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	3	The voice of one crying in the wilderness : Prepare ye the way of Jehovah , make straight in the desert a highway for our God !
DARBY	Isaiah	40	4	Every valley shall be raised up , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough places a plain .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	5	And the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed , and all flesh shall see [ it ] together : for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	6	A voice saith , Cry . And he saith , What shall I cry ? —All flesh is grass , and all the comeliness thereof as the flower of the field .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	7	The grass withereth , the flower fadeth , for the breath of Jehovah bloweth upon it : surely the people is grass .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	8	The grass withereth , the flower fadeth ; but the word of our God abideth for ever .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	9	O Zion , that bringest glad tidings , get thee up into a high mountain ; O Jerusalem , that bringest glad tidings , lift up thy voice with strength : lift it up , be not afraid ; say unto the cities of Judah , Behold your God !
DARBY	Isaiah	40	10	Behold , the Lord Jehovah will come with might , and his arm shall rule for him ; behold , his reward is with him , and his recompence before him .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	11	He will feed his flock like a shepherd : he will gather the lambs with his arm , and carry them in his bosom ; he will gently lead those that give suck .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	12	Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand , and meted out the heavens with [ his ] span , and grasped the dust of the earth in a measure , and weighed the mountains in a balance , and the hills in scales ?
DARBY	Isaiah	40	13	Who hath directed the Spirit of Jehovah , and , [ as ] his counsellor , hath taught him ?
DARBY	Isaiah	40	14	With whom took he counsel , and [ who ] gave him intelligence , and instructed him in the path of judgment , and taught him knowledge , and shewed him the way of understanding ?
DARBY	Isaiah	40	15	Behold , the nations are esteemed as a drop of the bucket , and as the fine dust on the scales ; behold , he taketh up the isles as an atom .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	16	And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn , nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt-offering .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	17	All the nations are as nothing before him ; they are esteemed by him less than a cipher , and vanity .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	18	To whom then will ye liken God ? and what likeness will ye compare unto him ?
DARBY	Isaiah	40	19	The workman casteth a graven image , and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold , and casteth silver chains [ for it ] .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	20	He that is impoverished , so that he hath no offering , chooseth a tree that doth not rot ; he seeketh unto him a skilled workman to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	21	—Do ye not know ? Have ye not heard ? Hath it not been told you from the beginning ? Have ye not understood the foundation of the earth ?
DARBY	Isaiah	40	22	[ It is ] he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth , and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers ; that stretcheth out the heavens as a gauze curtain , and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in ;
DARBY	Isaiah	40	23	that bringeth the princes to nothing , that maketh the judges of the earth as vanity .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	24	Scarcely are they planted , scarcely are they sown , scarcely hath their stock taken root in the earth , but he also bloweth upon them and they wither , and the whirlwind taketh them away as stubble .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	25	To whom then will ye liken me , or shall I be equal ? saith the Holy One .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	26	Lift up your eyes on high , and see ! Who hath created these things , bringing out their host by number ? He calleth them all by name ; through the greatness of his might and strength of power , not one faileth .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	27	Why sayest thou , Jacob , and speakest , O Israel , My way is hid from Jehovah , and my right is passed away from my God ?
DARBY	Isaiah	40	28	Dost thou not know , hast thou not heard , that the everlasting God , Jehovah , the Creator of the ends of the earth , fainteth not nor tireth ? There is no searching of his understanding .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	29	He giveth power to the faint ; and to him that hath no might he increaseth strength .
DARBY	Isaiah	40	30	Even the youths shall faint and shall tire , and the young men shall stumble and fall ;
DARBY	Isaiah	40	31	but they that wait upon Jehovah shall renew [ their ] strength : they shall mount up with wings as eagles ; they shall run , and not tire ; they shall walk , and not faint .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	41	Keep silence before me , islands ; and let the peoples renew [ their ] strength : let them come near ; then let them speak : let us draw near together to judgment .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	2	Who raised up from the east him whom righteousness calleth to its foot ? He gave the nations before him , and caused him to have dominion over kings ; he gave them as dust to his sword , as driven stubble to his bow .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	3	He pursued them , he passed on in safety , by a way he had never come with his feet .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	4	Who hath wrought and done [ it ] , calling the generations from the beginning ? I , Jehovah , the first ; and with the last , I [ am ] HE .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	5	The isles saw [ it ] , and feared ; the ends of the earth trembled : they drew near , and came .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	6	They helped every one his neighbour , and [ each ] said to his brother , Take courage .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	7	And the artizan encouraged the founder , he that smootheth [ with ] the hammer him that smiteth on the anvil , saying of the soldering , It is good ; and he fasteneth it with nails , that it be not moved .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	8	But thou , Israel , my servant , Jacob , whom I have chosen , the seed of Abraham , my friend
DARBY	Isaiah	41	9	—thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth , and called from the extremities thereof , and to whom I said , Thou art my servant , I have chosen thee and not rejected thee ,
DARBY	Isaiah	41	10	—Fear not , for I [ am ] with thee ; be not dismayed , for I [ am ] thy God : I will strengthen thee , yea , I will help thee , yea , I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	11	Lo , all that are incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded ; they that strive with thee shall be as nothing , and shall perish .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	12	Thou shalt seek them , and shalt not find them—them that contend with thee ; they that war against thee shall be as nothing , and as a thing of nought .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	13	For I , Jehovah , thy God , hold thy right hand , saying unto thee , Fear not ; I will help thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	14	Fear not , thou worm Jacob , ye men of Israel ; I will help thee , saith Jehovah , and thy Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	15	Behold , I have made of thee a new sharp threshing instrument having double teeth : thou shalt thresh and beat small the mountains , and shalt make the hills as chaff ;
DARBY	Isaiah	41	16	thou shalt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the whirlwind shall scatter them ; and thou shalt rejoice in Jehovah , thou shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	17	The afflicted and the needy seek water , and there is none ; their tongue faileth for thirst : I , Jehovah , will answer them , [ I ] , the God of Israel , will not forsake them .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	18	I will open rivers on the bare heights , and fountains in the midst of the valleys ; I will make the wilderness into a pool of water , and the dry land into water-springs .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	19	I will give in the wilderness the cedar , acacia , myrtle , and oleaster ; I will set in the desert the cypress , pine , and box-tree together ;
DARBY	Isaiah	41	20	that they may see , and know , and consider , and understand together , that the hand of Jehovah hath done this , and the Holy One of Israel hath created it .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	21	Produce your cause , saith Jehovah ; bring forward your arguments , saith the King of Jacob .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	22	Let them bring them forward , and declare to us what shall happen : shew the former things , what they are , that we may give attention to them , and know the end of them ; —or let us hear things to come :
DARBY	Isaiah	41	23	declare the things that are to happen hereafter , that we may know that ye are gods ; yea , do good , or do evil , that we may be astonished , and behold it together .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	24	Behold , ye are less than nothing , and your work is of nought ; an abomination is he that chooseth you . …
DARBY	Isaiah	41	25	I have raised up one from the north , and he shall come , —from the rising of the sun , he who will call upon my name ; and he shall come upon princes as on mortar , and as the potter treadeth clay .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	26	Who hath declared [ it ] from the beginning , that we may know ? and beforetime , that we may say , [ It is ] right ? Indeed , there is none that declareth ; no , none that sheweth ; no , none that heareth your words .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	27	The first , [ I said ] to Zion , Behold , behold them ! and to Jerusalem , I will give one that bringeth glad tidings .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	28	And I beheld , and there was no man ; even among them , —and there was no counsellor , that , when I asked of them , could answer a word .
DARBY	Isaiah	41	29	Behold , they are all vanity , their works are nought , their molten images are wind and emptiness .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	42	Behold my servant whom I uphold , mine elect [ in whom ] my soul delighteth ! I will put my Spirit upon him ; he shall bring forth judgment to the nations .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	2	He shall not cry , nor lift up , nor cause his voice to be heard in the street .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	3	A bruised reed shall he not break , and smoking flax shall he not quench : he shall bring forth judgment according to truth .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	4	He shall not faint nor be in haste , till he have set justice in the earth : and the isles shall wait for his law .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	5	Thus saith God , Jehovah , he that created the heavens and stretched them out , he that spread forth the earth and its productions , he that giveth breath unto the people upon it , and spirit to them that walk therein :
DARBY	Isaiah	42	6	I , Jehovah , have called thee in righteousness , and will take hold of thy hand ; and I will preserve thee , and give thee for a covenant of the people , for a light of the nations ,
DARBY	Isaiah	42	7	to open the blind eyes , to bring forth the prisoner from the prison , them that sit in darkness out of the house of restraint .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	8	I am Jehovah , that is my name ; and my glory will I not give to another , neither my praise to graven images .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	9	Behold , the former things are come to pass , and new things do I declare : before they spring forth will I cause you to hear them .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	10	Sing unto Jehovah a new song , his praise from the end of the earth , ye that go down to the sea , and all that is therein , the isles and their inhabitants .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	11	Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up [ their voice ] , the villages that Kedar doth inhabit ; let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them shout from the top of the mountains :
DARBY	Isaiah	42	12	let them give glory unto Jehovah , and declare his praise in the islands .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	13	Jehovah will go forth as a mighty man , he will stir up jealousy like a man of war : he will cry , yea , he will shout ; he will shew himself mighty against his enemies .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	14	Long time have I holden my peace ; I have been still , I have restrained myself : I will cry like a woman that travaileth ; I will blow and pant at once .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	15	I will lay waste mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs ; and I will make the rivers islands , and I will dry up the pools .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	16	And I will bring the blind by a way that they know not , in paths that they know not will I lead them ; I will make darkness light before them , and crooked things straight . These things will I do unto them , and not forsake them .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	17	They shall be turned back , they shall be covered with shame , that confide in graven images , that say to the molten images , Ye are our gods .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	18	—Hear , ye deaf ; and look , ye blind , that ye may see .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	19	Who is blind , but my servant ? and deaf , as my messenger whom I sent ? Who is blind as he in whom I have trusted , and blind as Jehovah 's servant ,
DARBY	Isaiah	42	20	—seeing many things , and thou observest not ? With opened ears , he heareth not .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	21	Jehovah had delight [ in him ] for his righteousness ' sake : he hath magnified the law , and made it honourable .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	22	But this is a people robbed and spoiled ; they are all of them snared in holes , and hidden in prison-houses ; they are become a prey , and none delivereth , —a spoil , and none saith , Restore .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	23	Who among you will give ear to this , [ who ] will hearken and hear what is to come ?
DARBY	Isaiah	42	24	Who gave Jacob for a spoil , and Israel to the robbers ? Did not Jehovah , he against whom we have sinned ? And they would not walk in his ways , neither did they hearken unto his law .
DARBY	Isaiah	42	25	And he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger , and the strength of battle : and it set him on fire round about , yet he knew not ; and it burned him , yet he took it not to heart .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	43	But now thus saith Jehovah , that created thee , O Jacob , and he that formed thee , O Israel : Fear not , for I have redeemed thee , I have called [ thee ] by thy name ; thou art mine .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	2	When thou passest through the waters , I [ will be ] with thee ; and through the rivers , they shall not overflow thee ; when thou walkest through the fire , thou shalt not be burned , neither shall the flame kindle upon thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	3	For I [ am ] Jehovah thy God , the Holy One of Israel , thy Saviour : I gave Egypt for thy ransom , Ethiopia and Seba for thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	4	Since thou wast precious in my sight , thou hast been honourable , and I have loved thee ; and I will give men for thee , and peoples for thy life .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	5	Fear not , for I [ am ] with thee : I will bring thy seed from the east , and gather thee from the west ;
DARBY	Isaiah	43	6	I will say to the north , Give up ; and to the south , Keep not back : bring my sons from afar , and my daughters from the end of the earth ,
DARBY	Isaiah	43	7	every one that is called by my name , and whom I have created for my glory : I have formed him , yea , I have made him .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	8	Bring forth the blind people that have eyes , and the deaf that have ears .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	9	Let all the nations be gathered together , and let the peoples be assembled : who among them declareth this , or causeth us to hear former things ? let them bring forth their witnesses , that they may be justified ; or let them hear , and say , [ It is ] truth .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	10	Ye are my witnesses , saith Jehovah , and my servant whom I have chosen ; that ye may know and believe me , and understand that I [ am ] HE : before me there was no God formed , neither shall there be after me .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	11	I , I [ am ] Jehovah ; and besides me there is no saviour .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	12	It is I that have declared , and have saved , and have shewed , when there was no strange [ god ] among you ; and ye are my witnesses , saith Jehovah , that I [ am ] God .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	13	Yea , since the day was , I [ am ] HE , and there is none that delivereth out of my hand : I will work , and who shall hinder it ?
DARBY	Isaiah	43	14	Thus saith Jehovah , your Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel : For your sake I have sent to Babylon , and have brought all of them down as fugitives , even the Chaldeans , whose cry is in the ships .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	15	I [ am ] Jehovah , your Holy One , the Creator of Israel , your King .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	16	Thus saith Jehovah , who maketh a way in the sea , and a path in the mighty waters ,
DARBY	Isaiah	43	17	who bringeth forth chariot and horse , army and power—they lie down together , they shall not rise ; they are extinct , they are quenched as tow :
DARBY	Isaiah	43	18	—Remember not the former things , neither consider the ancient things :
DARBY	Isaiah	43	19	behold , I do a new thing ; now it shall spring forth : shall ye not know it ? I will even make a way in the wilderness , rivers in the waste .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	20	The beast of the field shall glorify me , the jackals and the ostriches ; for I will give waters in the wilderness , rivers in the waste , to give drink to my people , my chosen .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	21	This people have I formed for myself : they shall shew forth my praise .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	22	—But thou hast not called upon me , Jacob ; for thou hast been weary of me , O Israel :
DARBY	Isaiah	43	23	thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt-offerings , neither hast thou glorified me with thy sacrifices . I have not caused thee to toil with an oblation , nor wearied thee with incense .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	24	Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money , neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices ; but thou hast made me to toil with thy sins , thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	25	—I , I [ am ] He that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake , and I will not remember thy sins .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	26	Put me in remembrance , let us plead together ; rehearse thine own [ cause ] , that thou mayest be justified .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	27	Thy first father hath sinned , and thy mediators have rebelled against me .
DARBY	Isaiah	43	28	And I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary , and have given Jacob to the ban , and Israel to reproaches .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	44	And now hear , Jacob , my servant , and Israel , whom I have chosen :
DARBY	Isaiah	44	2	thus saith Jehovah , that made thee , and formed thee from the womb , who helpeth thee , Fear not , Jacob , my servant , and thou , Jeshurun , whom I have chosen .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	3	For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty , and floods upon the dry ground ; I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed , and my blessing upon thine offspring .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	4	And they shall spring up among the grass , as willows by the water-courses .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	5	One shall say , I am Jehovah 's ; and another shall call [ himself ] by the name of Jacob ; and another shall write with his hand : [ I am ] Jehovah 's , and surname [ himself ] by the name of Israel .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	6	Thus saith Jehovah , the King of Israel , and his Redeemer , Jehovah of hosts : I [ am ] the first , and I [ am ] the last , and beside me there is no God .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	7	And who , as I , shall call , and shall declare it , and set it in order for me , since I appointed the ancient people ? And the coming things , and those that shall happen , let them declare unto them .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	8	Fear not , neither be afraid . Have I not caused thee to hear from that time , and have declared it ? and ye are my witnesses . Is there a +God beside me ? yea , there is no Rock : I know not any .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	9	They that form a graven image are all of them vanity , and their delectable things are of no profit ; and they are their own witnesses : they see not , nor know ; —that they may be ashamed .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	10	Who hath formed a god , or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing ?
DARBY	Isaiah	44	11	Behold , all his fellows shall be ashamed ; and the workmen are but men . Let them all be gathered together , let them stand up : they shall fear , they shall be ashamed together .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	12	The iron-smith [ hath ] a chisel , and he worketh in the coals , and he fashioneth it with hammers , and worketh it with his strong arm ; —but he is hungry , and his strength faileth ; he hath not drunk water , and he is faint .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	13	The worker in wood stretcheth out a line ; he marketh it out with red chalk ; he formeth it with sharp tools , and he marketh it out with the compass , and maketh it after the figure of a man , according to the beauty of man : that it may remain in the house .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	14	When he heweth him down cedars , he taketh also a holm-oak and a terebinth—he chooseth for himself among the trees of the forest : he planteth a pine , and the rain maketh [ it ] grow .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	15	And it shall be for a man to burn , and he taketh thereof , and warmeth himself ; he kindleth it also , and baketh bread ; he maketh also a god , and worshippeth it ; he maketh it a graven image , and falleth down thereto .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	16	He burneth part thereof in the fire ; with part thereof he eateth flesh , he roasteth roast , and is satisfied ; yea , he is warm , and saith , Aha , I am become warm , I have seen the fire .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	17	And with the remainder thereof he maketh a god , his graven image ; he falleth down unto it , and worshippeth it , and prayeth unto it , and saith , Deliver me , for thou art my god .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	18	They have no knowledge , and understand not ; for he hath plastered their eyes , that they may not see ; and their hearts , that they may not understand .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	19	And none taketh it to heart , neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say , I have burned part of it in the fire , and have also baked bread upon the coals thereof , I have roasted flesh , and eaten [ it ] , and with the rest thereof shall I make an abomination ? shall I bow down to a block of wood ?
DARBY	Isaiah	44	20	He feedeth on ashes ; a deceived heart hath turned him aside , that he can not deliver his soul , nor say , Is there not a lie in my right hand ?
DARBY	Isaiah	44	21	Remember these things , O Jacob , and Israel , for thou art my servant ; I have formed thee : thou art my servant , Israel ; thou shalt not be forgotten of me .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	22	I have blotted out , as a thick cloud , thy transgressions , and , as a cloud , thy sins : return unto me ; for I have redeemed thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	23	Sing , ye heavens ; for Jehovah hath done it : shout , ye lower parts of the earth ; break forth into singing , ye mountains , the forest , and every tree therein ! For Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob , and glorified himself in Israel .
DARBY	Isaiah	44	24	Thus saith Jehovah , thy Redeemer , and he that formed thee from the womb : I [ am ] Jehovah , the maker of all things ; who alone stretched out the heavens , who did spread forth the earth by myself ;
DARBY	Isaiah	44	25	—he that frustrateth the tokens of the liars , and maketh diviners mad ; that turneth wise men backward , and maketh their knowledge foolish ;
DARBY	Isaiah	44	26	that confirmeth the word of his servant , and performeth the counsel of his messengers ; that saith to Jerusalem , Thou shalt be inhabited ; and to the cities of Judah , Ye shall be built up , and I will raise up their ruins ;
DARBY	Isaiah	44	27	that saith to the deep , Be dry , and I will dry up thy rivers ;
DARBY	Isaiah	44	28	that saith of Cyrus , [ He is ] my shepherd , and he shall perform all my pleasure ; even saying to Jerusalem , Thou shalt be built ; and to the temple , Thy foundation shall be laid .
DARBY	Isaiah	45	45	Thus saith Jehovah to his anointed , to Cyrus , whose right hand I have holden , to subdue nations before him—and I will loose the loins of kings ; to open before him the two-leaved doors , and the gates shall not be shut :
DARBY	Isaiah	45	2	I will go before thee , and make the elevated places plain ; I will break in pieces the brazen doors , and cut asunder the bars of iron ;
DARBY	Isaiah	45	3	and I will give thee the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places ; that thou mayest know that I , Jehovah , who call thee by name , [ am ] the God of Israel .
DARBY	Isaiah	45	4	For Jacob my servant 's sake , and Israel mine elect , I have called thee by thy name ; I surnamed thee , though thou didst not know me ;
DARBY	Isaiah	45	5	I [ am ] Jehovah , and there is none else ; there is no God beside me : I girded thee , and thou hast not known me ;
DARBY	Isaiah	45	6	—that they may know from the rising of the sun , and from the going down , that there is none beside me . I [ am ] Jehovah , and there is none else ;
DARBY	Isaiah	45	7	forming the light and creating darkness , making peace and creating evil : I , Jehovah , do all these things .
DARBY	Isaiah	45	8	Drop down , [ ye ] heavens , from above , and let the skies pour down righteousness ; let the earth open , and let them bring forth salvation , and with it let righteousness spring up . I , Jehovah , have created it .
DARBY	Isaiah	45	9	Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker ! Let a potsherd [ strive ] with the potsherds of the earth . Shall the clay say to him that formeth it , What makest thou ? Or thy work , He hath no hands ?
DARBY	Isaiah	45	10	Woe unto him that saith unto [ his ] father , What begettest thou ? Or to [ his ] mother , What hast thou brought forth ?
DARBY	Isaiah	45	11	Thus saith Jehovah , the Holy One of Israel , and his Maker : Ask me of the things to come ; concerning my sons , and concerning the work of my hands , command ye me .
DARBY	Isaiah	45	12	It is I that have made the earth , and created man upon it ; it is I , my hands , that have stretched out the heavens , and all their host have I commanded .
DARBY	Isaiah	45	13	It is I that have raised him up in righteousness , and I will make all his ways straight : he shall build my city , and he shall let go my captives , not for price nor reward , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Isaiah	45	14	Thus saith Jehovah : The wealth of Egypt , and the merchandise of Ethiopia and the Sabeans , men of stature , shall come over unto thee , and they shall be thine : they shall walk after thee ; in chains they shall come over , and they shall bow down unto thee , they shall make supplication unto thee , [ saying , ] Surely God is in thee ; and there is none else , no other God . …
DARBY	Isaiah	45	15	Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself , O God of Israel , the Saviour . …
DARBY	Isaiah	45	16	They shall be ashamed , and also confounded , all of them ; they shall go away in confusion together , the makers of idols .
DARBY	Isaiah	45	17	Israel shall be saved by Jehovah with an everlasting salvation : ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded , unto the ages of ages .
DARBY	Isaiah	45	18	For thus saith Jehovah who created the heavens , God himself who formed the earth and made it , he who established it , —not as waste did he create it : he formed it to be inhabited : —I [ am ] Jehovah , and there is none else .
DARBY	Isaiah	45	19	I have not spoken in secret , in a dark place of the earth ; I said not unto the seed of Jacob , Seek me in vain : I [ am ] Jehovah , speaking righteousness , declaring things which are right .
DARBY	Isaiah	45	20	Gather yourselves and come ; draw near together , ye that are escaped of the nations . They have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image , and pray unto a god that can not save .
DARBY	Isaiah	45	21	Declare and bring [ them ] near ; yea , let them take counsel together : who hath caused this to be heard from ancient time ? [ who ] hath declared it long ago ? Is it not I , Jehovah ? And there is no God else beside me ; a just God and a Saviour , there is none besides me .
DARBY	Isaiah	45	22	Look unto me , and be ye saved , all the ends of the earth : for I [ am ] God , and there is none else .
DARBY	Isaiah	45	23	I have sworn by myself , the word is gone out of my mouth [ in ] righteousness and shall not return , that unto me every knee shall bow , every tongue shall swear .
DARBY	Isaiah	45	24	Only in Jehovah , shall one say , have I righteousness and strength . To him shall [ men ] come ; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed .
DARBY	Isaiah	45	25	In Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be justified , and shall glory .
DARBY	Isaiah	46	46	Bel is bowed down , Nebo bendeth ; their idols are upon the beasts , and upon the cattle : the things ye carried are laid on , a burden to the weary [ beast ] .
DARBY	Isaiah	46	2	They bend , they are bowed down together ; they could not deliver the burden , and themselves are gone into captivity .
DARBY	Isaiah	46	3	Hearken unto me , house of Jacob , and all the remnant of the house of Israel , ye who have been borne from the belly , who have been carried from the womb :
DARBY	Isaiah	46	4	Even to old age , I [ am ] HE , and unto hoary hairs I will carry [ you ] : It is I that have made , and I will bear , and I will carry , and will deliver .
DARBY	Isaiah	46	5	To whom will ye liken me and make me equal , or compare me , that we may be like ?
DARBY	Isaiah	46	6	—They lavish gold out of the bag , and weigh silver in the balance ; they hire a goldsmith , and he maketh it a god : they fall down , yea , they worship .
DARBY	Isaiah	46	7	They bear him on the shoulder , they carry him , and set him in his place ; there he standeth , he doth not remove from his place : yea , one crieth unto him , and he answereth not ; he saveth him not out of his trouble .
DARBY	Isaiah	46	8	Remember this , and shew yourselves men ; call it to mind , ye transgressors .
DARBY	Isaiah	46	9	Remember the former things of old ; for I [ am ] God , and there is none else ; [ I am ] God , and there is none like me ;
DARBY	Isaiah	46	10	declaring the end from the beginning , and from ancient times the things that are not yet done , saying , My counsel shall stand , and I will do all my pleasure ;
DARBY	Isaiah	46	11	calling a bird of prey from the east , the man of my counsel from a far country . Yea , I have spoken , I will also bring it to pass ; I have purposed it , I will also do it .
DARBY	Isaiah	46	12	Hearken unto me , ye stout-hearted , that are far from righteousness :
DARBY	Isaiah	46	13	I bring near my righteousness ; it shall not be far off , and my salvation shall not delay ; and I will give salvation in Zion , [ and ] unto Israel my glory .
DARBY	Isaiah	47	47	Come down and sit in the dust , virgin-daughter of Babylon ! Sit on the ground , — [ there is ] no throne , O daughter of the Chaldeans ; for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate .
DARBY	Isaiah	47	2	Take the millstones , and grind meal ; remove thy veil , lift up the train , uncover the leg , pass over rivers :
DARBY	Isaiah	47	3	thy nakedness shall be uncovered , yea , thy shame shall be seen . I will take vengeance , and I will meet none [ to stay me ] . …
DARBY	Isaiah	47	4	Our Redeemer , Jehovah of hosts is his name , the Holy One of Israel . …
DARBY	Isaiah	47	5	Sit silent , and get thee into darkness , daughter of the Chaldeans ; for thou shalt no more be called , Mistress of kingdoms .
DARBY	Isaiah	47	6	I was wroth with my people , I polluted mine inheritance , and gave them into thy hand : thou didst shew them no mercy ; upon the aged didst thou very heavily lay thy yoke ;
DARBY	Isaiah	47	7	and thou saidst , I shall be a mistress for ever ; so that thou didst not take these things to heart , thou didst not remember the end thereof .
DARBY	Isaiah	47	8	And now hear this , thou voluptuous one , that dwellest carelessly , that sayest in thy heart , It is I , and there is none but me ; I shall not sit as a widow , neither shall I know loss of children :
DARBY	Isaiah	47	9	yet these two things shall come upon thee in a moment , in one day , loss of children and widowhood ; they shall come upon thee in full measure for the multitude of thy sorceries , for the great abundance of thine enchantments .
DARBY	Isaiah	47	10	For thou hast confided in thy wickedness : thou hast said , None seeth me . Thy wisdom and thy knowledge , it hath seduced thee ; and thou hast said in thy heart , It is I , and there is none but me .
DARBY	Isaiah	47	11	But evil shall come upon thee—thou shalt not know from whence it riseth ; and mischief shall fall upon thee , which thou shalt not be able to ward off ; and desolation that thou suspectest not shall come upon thee suddenly .
DARBY	Isaiah	47	12	Stand now with thine enchantments and with the multitude of thy sorceries , wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth ; if so be thou shalt be able to turn them to profit , if so be thou mayest cause terror .
DARBY	Isaiah	47	13	Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels . Let now the interpreters of the heavens , the observers of the stars , who predict according to the new moons what shall come upon thee , stand up , and save thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	47	14	Behold , they shall be as stubble , the fire shall burn them ; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame : there shall not be a coal to warm at , [ nor ] fire to sit before it .
DARBY	Isaiah	47	15	Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured , they that trafficked with thee from thy youth : they shall wander every one to his own quarter ; there is none to save thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	48	Hear ye this , house of Jacob , who are called by the name of Israel , and are come forth out of the waters of Judah , who swear by the name of Jehovah , and make mention of the God of Israel , not in truth , nor in righteousness .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	2	For they are named after the holy city , and stay themselves upon the God of Israel : Jehovah of hosts is his name .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	3	I have declared the former things long ago ; and they went forth out of my mouth , and I caused them to be heard : I wrought suddenly , and they came to pass .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	4	Because I knew that thou art obstinate , and thy neck is an iron sinew , and thy brow brass ,
DARBY	Isaiah	48	5	so I have long ago declared [ them ] to thee ; before they came to pass I caused thee to hear [ them ] ; lest thou shouldest say , Mine idol hath done them , and my graven image , or my molten image hath commanded them .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	6	Thou heardest , see all this ; —and ye , will not ye declare [ it ] ? I have caused thee to hear new things from this time , and things hidden , and that thou knewest not :
DARBY	Isaiah	48	7	they are created now , and not long ago ; and before this day thou hast not heard them , lest thou shouldest say , Behold , I knew them .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	8	Yea , thou heardest not , yea , thou knewest not , yea , from of old thine ear was not opened ; for I knew that thou wouldest ever deal treacherously , and thou wast called a transgressor from the womb .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	9	For my name 's sake I will defer mine anger , and [ for ] my praise will I refrain as to thee , that I cut thee not off .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	10	Behold , I have refined thee , but not as silver ; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	11	For mine own sake , for mine own sake , will I do [ it ] ; for how should [ my name ] be profaned ? and I will not give my glory unto another .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	12	Hearken unto me , Jacob , and [ thou ] Israel , my called . I [ am ] HE ; I , the first , and I , the last .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	13	Yea , my hand hath laid the foundation of the earth , and my right hand hath spread abroad the heavens : I call unto them , they stand up together .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	14	All ye , gather yourselves together , and hear : which among them hath declared these things ? He whom Jehovah hath loved shall execute his pleasure on Babylon , and his arm [ shall be on ] the Chaldeans .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	15	I , [ even ] I , have spoken ; yea , I have called him ; I have brought him , and his way shall be prosperous .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	16	Come near unto me , hear ye this : I have not spoken in secret from the beginning ; from the time that it was , there am I ; and now the Lord Jehovah hath sent me , and his Spirit .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	17	Thus saith Jehovah , thy Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel ; I [ am ] Jehovah thy God , who teacheth thee for [ thy ] profit , who leadeth thee in the way that thou shouldest go .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	18	Oh that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments ! Then would thy peace have been as a river , and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea ;
DARBY	Isaiah	48	19	and thy seed would have been as the sand , and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof : their name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	20	Go ye forth from Babylon , flee from the Chaldeans , with a voice of singing ; declare , cause this to be heard , utter it to the end of the earth ; say ye , Jehovah hath redeemed his servant Jacob .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	21	And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts ; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them ; yea , he clave the rock , and the waters gushed out .
DARBY	Isaiah	48	22	There is no peace , saith Jehovah , unto the wicked .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	49	Listen , O isles , unto me ; and hearken , ye peoples from afar . Jehovah hath called me from the womb ; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	2	And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword , he hath concealed me under the shadow of his hand , and he hath made me a polished shaft : in his quiver hath he hidden me .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	3	And he said unto me , Thou art my servant , Israel , in whom I will glorify myself .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	4	—And I said , I have laboured in vain , I have spent my strength for nought and in vain ; nevertheless my judgment is with Jehovah , and my work with my God .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	5	And now , saith Jehovah , that formed me from the womb to be his servant , that I should bring Jacob again to him ; ( though Israel be not gathered , yet shall I be glorified in the eyes of Jehovah , and my God shall be my strength ; )
DARBY	Isaiah	49	6	—and he saith , It is a small thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob , and to restore the preserved of Israel ; I have even given thee for a light of the nations , that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	7	Thus saith Jehovah , the Redeemer of Israel , his Holy One , to him whom man despiseth , to him whom the nation abhorreth , to the servant of rulers : Kings shall see and arise , princes , and they shall worship , because of Jehovah who is faithful , the Holy One of Israel , who hath chosen thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	8	Thus saith Jehovah : In a time of acceptance have I answered thee , and in the day of salvation have I helped thee ; and I will preserve thee , and give thee for a covenant of the people , to establish the land , to cause to inherit the desolate heritages ;
DARBY	Isaiah	49	9	saying to the prisoners , Go forth ; to them that are in darkness , Shew yourselves . They shall feed in the ways , and their pasture shall be on all bare hills .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	10	They shall not hunger nor thirst , neither shall the heat nor sun smite them ; for he that hath mercy on them will lead them , and by the springs of water will he guide them .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	11	And I will make all my mountains a way , and my highways shall be raised up .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	12	Behold , these shall come from afar ; and behold , these from the north and from the west ; and these from the land of Sinim .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	13	Shout , ye heavens ; and be joyful , thou earth ; and break forth into singing , ye mountains : for Jehovah hath comforted his people , and will have mercy upon his afflicted ones .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	14	But Zion said , Jehovah hath forsaken me , and the Lord hath forgotten me .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	15	Can a woman forget her sucking child , that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb ? Even these forget , but I will not forget thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	16	Lo , I have graven thee upon the palms of [ my ] hands ; thy walls are continually before me .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	17	Thy sons shall make haste ; thy destroyers and they that laid thee waste shall go forth from thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	18	Lift up thine eyes round about and behold : they all gather themselves together , they come to thee . As I live , saith Jehovah , thou shalt indeed clothe thee with them all as with an ornament , and bind them on as a bride doth .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	19	For [ in ] thy waste and thy desolate places , and thy destroyed land , thou shalt even now be too straitened by reason of the inhabitants , and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	20	The children of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine ears , The place is too narrow for me : make room for me , that I may dwell .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	21	And thou shalt say in thy heart , Who hath borne me these , seeing I had lost my children and was desolate , an exile , and driven about ? and who hath brought up these ? behold , I was left alone ; these , where were they ?
DARBY	Isaiah	49	22	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I will lift up my hand to the nations , and set up my banner to the peoples ; and they shall bring thy sons in [ their ] bosom , and thy daughters shall be carried upon the shoulder .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	23	And kings shall be thy nursing-fathers , and their princesses thy nursing-mothers : they shall bow down to thee with the face toward the earth , and lick up the dust of thy feet . And thou shalt know that I [ am ] Jehovah ; for they shall not be ashamed who wait on me .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	24	Shall the prey be taken from the mighty ? and shall he that is rightfully captive be delivered ?
DARBY	Isaiah	49	25	For thus saith Jehovah : Even the captive of the mighty shall be taken away , and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered ; and I will strive with him that striveth with thee , and I will save thy children .
DARBY	Isaiah	49	26	And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh ; and they shall be drunken with their own blood , as with new wine . And all flesh shall know that I , Jehovah , [ am ] thy Saviour and thy Redeemer , the Mighty One of Jacob .
DARBY	Isaiah	50	50	Thus saith Jehovah : Where is the bill of your mother 's divorce , whom I have put away ? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you ? Behold , through your iniquities have ye sold yourselves , and for your transgressions is your mother put away .
DARBY	Isaiah	50	2	Wherefore did I come , and there was no man ? I called , and there was none to answer ? Is my hand at all shortened that I can not redeem , or have I no power to deliver ? behold , at my rebuke I dry up the sea , I make rivers a wilderness ; their fish stink because there is no water , and die for thirst .
DARBY	Isaiah	50	3	I clothe the heavens with blackness , and I make sackcloth their covering .
DARBY	Isaiah	50	4	The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of the instructed , that I should know how to succour by a word him that is weary . He wakeneth morning by morning , he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the instructed .
DARBY	Isaiah	50	5	The Lord Jehovah hath opened mine ear , and I was not rebellious ; I turned not away back .
DARBY	Isaiah	50	6	I gave my back to smiters , and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair ; I hid not my face from shame and spitting .
DARBY	Isaiah	50	7	But the Lord Jehovah will help me : therefore shall I not be confounded ; therefore have I set my face like a flint , and I know that I shall not be ashamed .
DARBY	Isaiah	50	8	He is near that justifieth me : who will contend with me ? let us stand together ; who is mine adverse party ? let him draw near unto me .
DARBY	Isaiah	50	9	Behold , the Lord Jehovah will help me ; who is he that shall condemn me ? Behold , they all shall grow old as a garment ; the moth shall eat them up .
DARBY	Isaiah	50	10	Who is among you that feareth Jehovah , that hearkeneth to the voice of his servant ? he that walketh in darkness , and hath no light , —let him confide in the name of Jehovah , and stay himself upon his God .
DARBY	Isaiah	50	11	Behold , all ye that kindle a fire , that compass yourselves about with sparks : walk in the light of your fire , and among the sparks [ that ] ye have kindled . This shall ye have of my hand : ye shall lie down in sorrow .
DARBY	Isaiah	51	51	Hearken unto me , ye that follow after righteousness , ye that seek Jehovah : look unto the rock [ whence ] ye were hewn , and to the hole of the pit [ whence ] ye were digged .
DARBY	Isaiah	51	2	Look unto Abraham your father , and unto Sarah that bore you ; for I called him when he was alone , and blessed him , and multiplied him .
DARBY	Isaiah	51	3	For Jehovah shall comfort Zion , he shall comfort all her waste places ; and he will make her wilderness like Eden , and her desert like the garden of Jehovah : gladness and joy shall be found therein , thanksgiving , and the voice of song .
DARBY	Isaiah	51	4	Listen unto me , my people ; and give ear unto me , my nation : for a law shall proceed from me , and I will establish my judgment for a light of the peoples .
DARBY	Isaiah	51	5	My righteousness is near , my salvation is gone forth , and mine arms shall judge the peoples : the isles shall wait for me , and in mine arm shall they trust .
DARBY	Isaiah	51	6	Lift up your eyes to the heavens , and look on the earth beneath : for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke , and the earth shall grow old like a garment , and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner ; but my salvation shall be for ever , and my righteousness shall not be abolished .
DARBY	Isaiah	51	7	Hearken unto me , ye that know righteousness , the people in whose heart is my law ; fear not the reproach of men , and be not afraid of their revilings .
DARBY	Isaiah	51	8	For the moth shall eat them up like a garment , and the worm shall eat them like wool ; but my righteousness shall be for ever , and my salvation from generation to generation .
DARBY	Isaiah	51	9	Awake , awake , put on strength , O arm of Jehovah ; awake , as in the days of old , [ as in ] the generations of passed ages . Is it not thou that hath hewn Rahab in pieces , [ and ] pierced the monster ?
DARBY	Isaiah	51	10	Is it not thou that dried up the sea , the waters of the great deep ; that made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over ?
DARBY	Isaiah	51	11	So the ransomed of Jehovah shall return , and come to Zion with singing ; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads : they shall obtain gladness and joy ; sorrow and sighing shall flee away .
DARBY	Isaiah	51	12	I , [ even ] I , am he that comforteth you : who art thou , that thou fearest a man that shall die , and the son of man that shall become as grass ;
DARBY	Isaiah	51	13	and forgettest Jehovah thy Maker , who hath stretched out the heavens , and laid the foundations of the earth ; and thou art afraid continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor , when he prepareth to destroy ? And where is the fury of the oppressor ?
DARBY	Isaiah	51	14	He that is bowed down shall speedily be loosed , and he shall not die in the pit , nor shall his bread fail .
DARBY	Isaiah	51	15	And I am Jehovah thy God , who raiseth the sea , so that its waves roar : Jehovah of hosts is his name .
DARBY	Isaiah	51	16	And I have put my words in thy mouth , and covered thee with the shadow of my hand , to plant the heavens , and to lay the foundations of the earth , and to say unto Zion , Thou art my people .
DARBY	Isaiah	51	17	Arouse thyself , arouse thyself , stand up , Jerusalem , which hast drunk at the hand of Jehovah the cup of his fury . Thou hast drunk , hast drained out the goblet-cup of bewilderment :
DARBY	Isaiah	51	18	—there is none to guide her among all the children that she hath brought forth ; neither is there any to take her by the hand of all the children that she hath brought up .
DARBY	Isaiah	51	19	These two [ things ] are come unto thee ; who will bemoan thee ? —desolation and destruction , and famine and sword : how shall I comfort thee ?
DARBY	Isaiah	51	20	Thy children have fainted , they lie at the head of all the streets , as an oryx in a net : they are full of the fury of Jehovah , the rebuke of thy God .
DARBY	Isaiah	51	21	Therefore hear now this , thou afflicted , and drunken , but not with wine :
DARBY	Isaiah	51	22	thus saith thy Lord , Jehovah , and thy God , who pleadeth the cause of his people , Behold , I take out of thy hand the cup of bewilderment , the goblet-cup of my fury ; thou shalt no more drink it again :
DARBY	Isaiah	51	23	and I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee ; who have said to thy soul , Bow down , that we may go over ; and thou hast laid thy body as the ground , and as the street to them that went over .
DARBY	Isaiah	52	52	Awake , awake ; put on thy strength , O Zion ; put on thy beautiful garments , Jerusalem , the holy city : for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean .
DARBY	Isaiah	52	2	Shake thyself from the dust ; arise , sit down , Jerusalem : loose thyself from the bands of thy neck , captive daughter of Zion .
DARBY	Isaiah	52	3	For thus saith Jehovah : Ye have sold yourselves for nought , and ye shall be redeemed without money .
DARBY	Isaiah	52	4	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah : My people went down at the first into Egypt to sojourn there , and Assyria oppressed them without cause ;
DARBY	Isaiah	52	5	and now , what have I here , saith Jehovah , that my people hath been taken away for nought ? They that rule over them make them to howl , saith Jehovah ; and continually all the day is my name scorned .
DARBY	Isaiah	52	6	Therefore my people shall know my name ; therefore [ they shall know ] in that day that I [ am ] HE , that saith , Here am I .
DARBY	Isaiah	52	7	How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that announceth glad tidings , that publisheth peace ; that announceth glad tidings of good , that publisheth salvation , that saith unto Zion , Thy God reigneth !
DARBY	Isaiah	52	8	—The voice of thy watchmen , they lift up the voice , they sing aloud together ; for they shall see eye to eye , when Jehovah shall bring again Zion .
DARBY	Isaiah	52	9	Break forth , sing aloud together , waste places of Jerusalem ; for Jehovah comforteth his people , he hath redeemed Jerusalem .
DARBY	Isaiah	52	10	Jehovah hath made bare his holy arm in the sight of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God .
DARBY	Isaiah	52	11	—Depart , depart , go out from thence , touch not what is unclean ; go out of the midst of her , be ye clean , that bear the vessels of Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	52	12	For ye shall not go out with haste , nor go by flight ; for Jehovah will go before you , and the God of Israel will be your rear-guard .
DARBY	Isaiah	52	13	Behold , my servant shall deal prudently ; he shall be exalted and be lifted up , and be very high .
DARBY	Isaiah	52	14	As many were astonished at thee—his visage was so marred more than any man , and his form more than the children of men
DARBY	Isaiah	52	15	—so shall he astonish many nations ; kings shall shut their mouths at him : for what had not been told them shall they see , and what they had not heard shall they consider .
DARBY	Isaiah	53	53	Who hath believed our report ? and to whom hath the arm of Jehovah been revealed ?
DARBY	Isaiah	53	2	For he shall grow up before him as a tender sapling , and as a root out of dry ground : he hath no form nor lordliness , and when we see him , there is no beauty that we should desire him .
DARBY	Isaiah	53	3	He is despised and left alone of men ; a man of sorrows , and acquainted with grief , and like one from whom [ men ] hide their faces ; —despised , and we esteemed him not .
DARBY	Isaiah	53	4	Surely * he * hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows ; and we , we did regard him stricken , smitten of God , and afflicted .
DARBY	Isaiah	53	5	But he was wounded for our transgressions , he was bruised for our iniquities ; the chastisement of our peace was upon him , and with his stripes we are healed .
DARBY	Isaiah	53	6	All we like sheep have gone astray , we have turned every one to his own way ; and Jehovah hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all .
DARBY	Isaiah	53	7	He was oppressed , and he was afflicted , but he opened not his mouth ; he was led as a lamb to the slaughter , and was as a sheep dumb before her shearers , and he opened not his mouth .
DARBY	Isaiah	53	8	He was taken from oppression and from judgment ; and who shall declare his generation ? for he was cut off out of the land of the living ; for the transgression of my people was he stricken .
DARBY	Isaiah	53	9	And [ men ] appointed his grave with the wicked , but he was with the rich in his death , because he had done no violence , neither was there guile in his mouth .
DARBY	Isaiah	53	10	Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise him ; he hath subjected [ him ] to suffering . When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin , he shall see a seed , he shall prolong [ his ] days , and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand .
DARBY	Isaiah	53	11	He shall see of [ the fruit of ] the travail of his soul , [ and ] shall be satisfied : by his knowledge shall my righteous servant instruct many in righteousness ; and * he * shall bear their iniquities .
DARBY	Isaiah	53	12	Therefore will I assign him a portion with the great , and he shall divide the spoil with the strong : because he hath poured out his soul unto death , and was reckoned with the transgressors ; and he bore the sin of many , and made intercession for the transgressors .
DARBY	Isaiah	54	54	Exult , thou barren , that didst not bear ; break forth into singing , and shout for joy , thou that didst not travail with child : for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	54	2	Enlarge the place of thy tent , and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations : spare not , lengthen thy cords , and strengthen thy stakes .
DARBY	Isaiah	54	3	For thou shalt spread abroad on the right hand and on the left ; and thy seed shall possess nations , and they shall make desolate cities to be inhabited .
DARBY	Isaiah	54	4	Fear not , for thou shalt not be ashamed ; neither be thou confounded , for thou shalt not be put to shame : for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth , and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more .
DARBY	Isaiah	54	5	For thy Maker is thy husband : Jehovah of hosts is his name , and thy Redeemer , the Holy One of Israel : the God of the whole earth shall he be called .
DARBY	Isaiah	54	6	For Jehovah hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit , and as a wife of youth , that hath been refused , saith thy God .
DARBY	Isaiah	54	7	For a small moment have I forsaken thee ; but with great mercies will I gather thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	54	8	In the outpouring of wrath have I hid my face from thee for a moment ; but with everlasting loving-kindness will I have mercy on thee , saith Jehovah , thy Redeemer .
DARBY	Isaiah	54	9	For this is [ as ] the waters of Noah unto me , since I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth : so have I sworn that I will no more be wroth with thee , nor rebuke thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	54	10	For the mountains shall depart , and the hills be removed ; but my loving-kindness shall not depart from thee , neither shall my covenant of peace be removed , saith Jehovah , that hath mercy on thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	54	11	[ Thou ] afflicted , tossed with tempest , not comforted ! Behold , I will set thy stones in antimony , and lay thy foundations with sapphires ;
DARBY	Isaiah	54	12	and I will make thy battlements of rubies , and thy gates of carbuncles , and all thy borders of precious stones .
DARBY	Isaiah	54	13	And all thy children [ shall be ] taught of Jehovah , and great shall be the peace of thy children .
DARBY	Isaiah	54	14	In righteousness shalt thou be established : thou shalt be far from oppression , for thou shalt not fear ; and from terror , for it shall not come near thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	54	15	Behold , they shall surely gather together , [ but ] not by me : whosoever gathereth together against thee shall fall because of thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	54	16	Behold , it is I who have created the smith that bloweth in the fire of coal , and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work ; and I have created the destroyer to ravage .
DARBY	Isaiah	54	17	No weapon that is prepared against thee shall prosper ; and every tongue that riseth against thee in judgment , thou shalt condemn . This is the inheritance of the servants of Jehovah ; and their righteousness is of me , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	55	55	Ho , every one that thirsteth , come ye to the waters ; and he that hath no money , come ye , buy , and eat : yea , come , buy wine and milk without money and without price !
DARBY	Isaiah	55	2	Wherefore do ye spend money for [ that which is ] not bread ? and your labour for that which satisfieth not ? Hearken diligently unto me , and eat ye [ that which is ] good , and let your soul delight itself in fatness .
DARBY	Isaiah	55	3	Incline your ear , and come unto me ; hear , and your soul shall live ; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you , the sure mercies of David .
DARBY	Isaiah	55	4	Behold , I have given him [ for ] a witness to the peoples , a prince and commander to the peoples .
DARBY	Isaiah	55	5	Behold , thou shalt call a nation thou knowest not , and a nation [ that ] knew not thee shall run unto thee , because of Jehovah thy God , and the Holy One of Israel ; for he hath glorified thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	55	6	Seek ye Jehovah while he may be found , call ye upon him while he is near .
DARBY	Isaiah	55	7	Let the wicked forsake his way , and the unrighteous man his thoughts ; and let him return unto Jehovah , and he will have mercy upon him ; and to our God , for he will abundantly pardon .
DARBY	Isaiah	55	8	For my thoughts are not your thoughts , neither are your ways my ways , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	55	9	For [ as ] the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts .
DARBY	Isaiah	55	10	For as the rain cometh down , and the snow from heaven , and returneth not thither , but watereth the earth , and maketh it bring forth and bud , that it may give seed to the sower , and bread to the eater :
DARBY	Isaiah	55	11	so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth : it shall not return unto me void , but it shall do that which I please , and it shall accomplish that for which I send it .
DARBY	Isaiah	55	12	For ye shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace ; the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing , and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands .
DARBY	Isaiah	55	13	Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress , and instead of the nettle shall come up the myrtle ; and it shall be to Jehovah for a name , for an everlasting sign [ that ] shall not be cut off .
DARBY	Isaiah	56	56	Thus saith Jehovah : Keep ye judgment and do righteousness ; for my salvation is near to come , and my righteousness to be revealed .
DARBY	Isaiah	56	2	Blessed is the man that doeth this , and the son of man that holdeth fast to it ; that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it , and keepeth his hand from doing any evil .
DARBY	Isaiah	56	3	And let not the son of the alien , that hath joined himself to Jehovah , speak saying , Jehovah hath entirely separated me from his people ; neither let the eunuch say , Behold , I am a dry tree ;
DARBY	Isaiah	56	4	for thus saith Jehovah : Unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths , and choose the things that please me , and hold fast to my covenant ,
DARBY	Isaiah	56	5	even unto them will I give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and daughters ; I will give them an everlasting name , that shall not be cut off .
DARBY	Isaiah	56	6	Also the sons of the alien , that join themselves to Jehovah , to minister unto him and to love the name of Jehovah , to be his servants , every one that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it , and holdeth fast to my covenant ;
DARBY	Isaiah	56	7	even them will I bring to my holy mountain , and make them joyful in my house of prayer ; their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar : for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the peoples .
DARBY	Isaiah	56	8	The Lord Jehovah , who gathereth the outcasts of Israel , saith : Yet will I gather [ others ] to him , with those of his that are gathered .
DARBY	Isaiah	56	9	All ye beasts of the field , come to devour , all ye beasts in the forest .
DARBY	Isaiah	56	10	His watchmen are all of them blind , they are without knowledge ; they are all dumb dogs that can not bark , dreaming , lying down , loving to slumber :
DARBY	Isaiah	56	11	and the dogs are greedy , they know not to be satisfied , and these are shepherds that know not how to discern : they all turn to their own way , every one for his gain , even to the last of them :
DARBY	Isaiah	56	12	Come , [ say they , ] I will fetch wine , and we will fill ourselves with strong drink ; and to-morrow shall be as this day , [ and ] much more abundant .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	57	The righteous perisheth , and no man layeth it to heart ; and merciful men are taken away , none considering that the righteous is taken away from before the evil .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	2	He entereth into peace : they rest in their beds , [ each one ] that hath walked in his uprightness .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	3	But draw near hither , ye sons of the sorceress , the seed of the adulterer and the harlot .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	4	Against whom do ye sport yourselves ? Against whom do ye make a wide mouth , [ and ] draw out the tongue ? Are ye not children of transgression , a seed of falsehood ,
DARBY	Isaiah	57	5	inflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree , slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks ?
DARBY	Isaiah	57	6	Among the smooth [ stones ] of the torrent is thy portion ; they , they are thy lot : even to them hast thou poured out a drink-offering , thou hast offered an oblation . Shall I be comforted myself as to these things ?
DARBY	Isaiah	57	7	Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed : even thither didst thou go up to offer sacrifice .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	8	Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance : for apart from me , thou hast uncovered thyself , and art gone up ; thou hast enlarged thy bed , and hast made agreement with them ; thou lovedst their bed , thou sawest their nakedness .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	9	And thou wentest to the king with ointment , and didst multiply thy perfumes , and didst send thy messengers afar off , and didst debase thyself unto Sheol .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	10	Thou wast wearied by the multitude of thy ways ; [ but ] thou saidst not , It is of no avail . Thou didst find a quickening of thy strength ; therefore thou wast not sick [ of it ] .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	11	And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared , that thou hast lied , and hast not remembered me , nor taken it to heart ? Have not I even of long time held my peace , and thou fearest me not ?
DARBY	Isaiah	57	12	I will declare thy righteousness , and thy works ; and they shall not profit thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	13	When thou criest , let them that are gathered by thee deliver thee ! But a wind shall carry them all away , a breath shall take them ; but he that putteth his trust in me shall inherit the land , and possess my holy mountain .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	14	And it shall be said , Cast up , cast up , prepare the way , take up the stumbling-blocks out of the way of my people .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	15	For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity , and whose name is Holy : I dwell in the high and holy [ place ] , and with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit , to revive the spirit of the humble , and to revive the heart of the contrite ones .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	16	For I will not contend for ever , neither will I be always wroth ; for the spirit would fail before me , and the souls [ which ] I have made .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	17	For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth , and smote him ; I hid me , and was wroth , and he went on backslidingly in the way of his heart .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	18	I have seen his ways , and will heal him ; and I will lead him , and will restore comforts unto him and to those of his that mourn .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	19	I create the fruit of the lips : peace , peace to him [ that is ] afar off , and to him [ that is ] nigh , saith Jehovah ; and I will heal him .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	20	But the wicked are like the troubled sea , which can not rest , and whose waters cast up mire and dirt .
DARBY	Isaiah	57	21	There is no peace , saith my God , to the wicked .
DARBY	Isaiah	58	58	Cry aloud , spare not , lift up thy voice like a trumpet , and declare unto my people their transgression , and to the house of Jacob their sins .
DARBY	Isaiah	58	2	Yet they seek me daily , and delight to know my ways , as a nation that doeth righteousness , and hath not forsaken the ordinance of their God ; they ask of me the ordinances of righteousness , they take delight in approaching to God :
DARBY	Isaiah	58	3	—Wherefore have we fasted , and thou seest not ; have afflicted our soul , and thou takest no knowledge ? Behold , in the day of your fast ye find what pleaseth [ you ] , and exact all your labours .
DARBY	Isaiah	58	4	Behold , ye have fasted for strife and debate , and to smite with the fist of wickedness ; ye do not at present fast , to cause your voice to be heard on high .
DARBY	Isaiah	58	5	Is such the fast that I have chosen , a day for a man to afflict his soul , —that he should bow down his head as a bulrush , and spread sackcloth and ashes [ under him ] ? Wilt thou call this a fast , and a day acceptable to Jehovah ?
DARBY	Isaiah	58	6	Is not this the fast which I have chosen : to loose the bands of wickedness , to undo the thongs of the yoke , and to send forth free the crushed , and that ye break every yoke ?
DARBY	Isaiah	58	7	Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry , and that thou bring to thy house the needy wanderers ; when thou seest the naked , that thou cover him ; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh ?
DARBY	Isaiah	58	8	Then shall thy light break forth as the dawn , and thy health shall spring forth speedily ; and thy righteousness shall go before thee , the glory of Jehovah shall be thy rearguard .
DARBY	Isaiah	58	9	Then shalt thou call , and Jehovah will answer ; thou shalt cry , and he will say , Here I am . If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke , the putting forth of the finger and the unjust speech ,
DARBY	Isaiah	58	10	and thou proffer thy soul to the hungry , and satisfy the afflicted soul : then shall thy light rise in the darkness , and thine obscurity be as midday ;
DARBY	Isaiah	58	11	and Jehovah will guide thee continually , and satisfy thy soul in drought , and strengthen thy bones ; and thou shalt be like a watered garden , and like a water-spring , whose waters deceive not .
DARBY	Isaiah	58	12	And they [ that come ] of thee shall build the old waste places : thou shalt raise up the foundations [ that have remained ] from generation to generation ; and thou shalt be called , Repairer of the breaches , restorer of frequented paths .
DARBY	Isaiah	58	13	If thou turn back thy foot from the sabbath , [ from ] doing thy pleasure on my holy day , and call the sabbath a delight , the holy [ day ] of Jehovah , honourable ; and thou honour him , not doing thine own ways , nor finding thine own pleasure , nor speaking [ idle ] words ;
DARBY	Isaiah	58	14	then shalt thou delight thyself in Jehovah , and I will cause thee to ride on the high places of the earth , and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father : for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	59	Behold , Jehovah 's hand is not shortened that it can not save , neither his ear heavy that it can not hear ;
DARBY	Isaiah	59	2	but your iniquities have separated between you and your God , and your sins have hid [ his ] face from you , that he doth not hear .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	3	For your hands are stained with blood , and your fingers with iniquity ; your lips speak lies , your tongue muttereth unrighteousness :
DARBY	Isaiah	59	4	none calleth for justice , none pleadeth in truthfulness . They trust in vanity , and speak falsehood ; they conceive mischief , and bring forth iniquity .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	5	They hatch serpents ' eggs , and weave the spider 's web : he that eateth of their eggs dieth , and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	6	Their webs shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works ; their works are works of iniquity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	7	Their feet run to evil , and they make haste to shed innocent blood ; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity ; wasting and destruction are in their paths ;
DARBY	Isaiah	59	8	the way of peace they know not , and there is no judgment in their goings ; they have made their paths crooked : whoso goeth therein knoweth not peace .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	9	Therefore is justice far from us , and righteousness overtaketh us not : we wait for light , and behold darkness ; for brightness , [ but ] we walk in obscurity .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	10	We grope for the wall like the blind , and we grope as if we had no eyes : we stumble at midday as in the twilight ; amongst the flourishing we are as the dead .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	11	We roar all like bears , and mourn grievously like doves : we look for judgment , and there is none ; for salvation , [ but ] it is far from us .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	12	For our transgressions are multiplied before thee , and our sins testify against us ; for our transgressions are with us ; and our iniquities , we know them :
DARBY	Isaiah	59	13	in transgressing and lying against Jehovah , and departing away from our God , speaking oppression and revolt , conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	14	And judgment is turned away backward , and righteousness standeth afar off ; for truth stumbleth in the street , and uprightness can not enter .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	15	And truth faileth ; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey . And Jehovah saw [ it ] , and it was evil in his sight that there was no judgment .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	16	And he saw that there was no man , and he wondered that there was no intercessor ; and his arm brought him salvation , and his righteousness , it sustained him .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	17	And he put on righteousness as a breastplate , and a helmet of salvation upon his head ; and he put on garments of vengeance [ for ] clothing , and was clad with zeal as a cloak .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	18	According to deeds , so will he repay : fury to his adversaries , recompence to his enemies ; to the islands he will repay recompence .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	19	And they shall fear the name of Jehovah from the west , and from the rising of the sun , his glory . When the adversary shall come in like a flood , the Spirit of Jehovah will lift up a banner against him .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	20	And the Redeemer will come to Zion , and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	59	21	And as for me , this is my covenant with them , saith Jehovah : My spirit that is upon thee , and my words which I have put in thy mouth , shall not depart out of thy mouth , nor out of the mouth of thy seed , nor out of the mouth of thy seed 's seed , saith Jehovah , from henceforth and for ever .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	60	Arise , shine ! for thy light is come , and the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	2	For behold , darkness shall cover the earth , and gross darkness the peoples ; but Jehovah will arise upon thee , and his glory shall be seen on thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	3	And the nations shall walk by thy light , and kings by the brightness of thy rising .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	4	Lift up thine eyes round about , and see : all they gather themselves together , they come to thee : thy sons come from afar , and thy daughters are carried upon the side .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	5	Then thou shalt see , and shalt be brightened , and thy heart shall throb , and be enlarged ; for the abundance of the sea shall be turned unto thee , the wealth of the nations shall come unto thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	6	A multitude of camels shall cover thee , young camels of Midian and Ephah ; all they from Sheba shall come : they shall bring gold and incense ; and they shall publish the praises of Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	7	All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered unto thee , the rams of Nebaioth shall serve thee : they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar , and I will beautify the house of my magnificence .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	8	Who are these that come flying as a cloud , and as doves to their dove-cotes ?
DARBY	Isaiah	60	9	For the isles shall await me , and the ships of Tarshish first , to bring thy sons from afar , their silver and their gold with them , unto the name of Jehovah thy God , and to the Holy One of Israel , for he hath glorified thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	10	And the sons of the alien shall build up thy walls , and their kings shall minister unto thee . For in my wrath I smote thee , but in my favour have I had mercy on thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	11	And thy gates shall stand open continually : ( they shall not be shut day nor night , ) that the wealth of the nations may be brought unto thee , and that their kings may be led [ to thee ] .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	12	For the nation and the kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish ; and those nations shall be utterly wasted .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	13	The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee , the cypress , pine , and box-tree together , to beautify the place of my sanctuary ; and I will make the place of my feet glorious .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	14	And the children of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee ; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet ; and they shall call thee The city of Jehovah , the Zion of the Holy One of Israel .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	15	Instead of thy being forsaken and hated , so that no one went through [ thee ] , I will make thee an eternal excellency , a joy from generation to generation .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	16	And thou shalt suck the milk of the nations , and shalt suck the breast of kings ; and thou shalt know that I , Jehovah , [ am ] thy Saviour and thy Redeemer , the Mighty One of Jacob .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	17	For bronze I will bring gold , and for iron I will bring silver , and for wood bronze , and for stones iron ; and I will make thine officers peace , and thy rulers righteousness .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	18	Violence shall no more be heard in thy land , wasting nor destruction within thy borders ; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation , and thy gates Praise .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	19	The sun shall be no more thy light by day , neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee ; but Jehovah shall be thine everlasting light , and thy God thy glory .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	20	Thy sun shall no more go down , neither shall thy moon withdraw itself ; for Jehovah shall be thine everlasting light , and the days of thy mourning shall be ended .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	21	Thy people also shall be all righteous : they shall possess the land for ever—the branch of my planting , the work of my hands , that I may be glorified .
DARBY	Isaiah	60	22	The little one shall become a thousand , and the smallest a mighty nation : I , Jehovah , will hasten it in its time .
DARBY	Isaiah	61	61	The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me , because Jehovah hath anointed me to announce glad tidings unto the meek ; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted , to proclaim liberty to the captives , and opening of the prison to them that are bound ;
DARBY	Isaiah	61	2	to proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah , and the day of vengeance of our God ; to comfort all that mourn ;
DARBY	Isaiah	61	3	to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion , that beauty should be given unto them instead of ashes , the oil of joy instead of mourning , the garment of praise instead of the spirit of heaviness : that they might be called terebinths of righteousness , the planting of Jehovah , that he may be glorified .
DARBY	Isaiah	61	4	And they shall build the old wastes , they shall raise up the former desolations , and they shall repair the waste cities , the places desolate from generation to generation .
DARBY	Isaiah	61	5	And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks , and the sons of the alien shall be your ploughmen and your vinedressers .
DARBY	Isaiah	61	6	But as for you , ye shall be called priests of Jehovah ; it shall be said of you : Ministers of our God . Ye shall eat the wealth of the nations , and into their glory shall ye enter .
DARBY	Isaiah	61	7	Instead of your shame [ ye shall have ] double ; instead of confusion they shall celebrate with joy their portion : therefore in their land they shall possess the double ; everlasting joy shall be unto them .
DARBY	Isaiah	61	8	For I , Jehovah , love judgment , I hate robbery with wrong ; and I will give their recompence in truth , and I will make an everlasting covenant with them .
DARBY	Isaiah	61	9	And their seed shall be known among the nations , and their offspring among the peoples : all that see them shall acknowledge them , that they are a seed that Jehovah hath blessed .
DARBY	Isaiah	61	10	I will greatly rejoice in Jehovah , my soul shall be joyful in my God ; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation , he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness , as a bridegroom decketh himself with the priestly turban , and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels .
DARBY	Isaiah	61	11	For as the earth bringeth forth her bud , and as a garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth , so the Lord Jehovah will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations .
DARBY	Isaiah	62	62	For Zion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem 's sake I will not be still , until her righteousness go forth as brightness , and her salvation as a torch that burneth .
DARBY	Isaiah	62	2	And the nations shall see thy righteousness , and all kings thy glory ; and thou shalt be called by a new name , which the mouth of Jehovah will name .
DARBY	Isaiah	62	3	And thou shalt be a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah , and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God .
DARBY	Isaiah	62	4	Thou shalt no more be termed , Forsaken ; neither shall thy land any more be termed , Desolate : but thou shalt be called , My delight is in her , and thy land , Married ; for Jehovah delighteth in thee , and thy land shall be married .
DARBY	Isaiah	62	5	For [ as ] a young man marrieth a virgin , shall thy sons marry thee ; and with the joy of the bridegroom over the bride , shall thy God rejoice over thee .
DARBY	Isaiah	62	6	I have set watchmen upon thy walls , Jerusalem ; all the day and all the night they shall never hold their peace : ye that put Jehovah in remembrance , keep not silence ,
DARBY	Isaiah	62	7	and give him no rest , till he establish , and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth .
DARBY	Isaiah	62	8	Jehovah hath sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his strength , I will indeed no more give thy corn [ to be ] food for thine enemies ; and the sons of the alien shall not drink thy new wine , for which thou hast laboured ;
DARBY	Isaiah	62	9	for they that have garnered it shall eat it , and praise Jehovah ; and they that have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my holiness .
DARBY	Isaiah	62	10	Go through , go through the gates ; prepare the way of the people ; cast up , cast up the highway ; gather out the stones ; lift up a banner for the peoples .
DARBY	Isaiah	62	11	Behold , Jehovah hath proclaimed unto the end of the earth , Say ye to the daughter of Zion , Behold , thy salvation cometh ; behold , his reward is with him , and his recompence before him .
DARBY	Isaiah	62	12	And they shall call them , The holy people , The redeemed of Jehovah ; and thou shalt be called , The sought out , The city not forsaken .
DARBY	Isaiah	63	63	Who is this that cometh from Edom , with deep-red garments from Bozrah , this that is glorious in his apparel , travelling in the greatness of his strength ? —I that speak in righteousness , mighty to save .
DARBY	Isaiah	63	2	—Wherefore is redness in thine apparel , and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winevat ?
DARBY	Isaiah	63	3	I have trodden the winepress alone , and of the peoples not a man was with me ; and I have trodden them in mine anger , and trampled them in my fury ; and their blood is sprinkled upon my garments , and I have stained all mine apparel .
DARBY	Isaiah	63	4	For the day of vengeance was in my heart , and the year of my redeemed had come .
DARBY	Isaiah	63	5	And I looked , and there was none to help ; and I wondered that there was none to uphold : and mine own arm brought salvation unto me ; and my fury , it upheld me .
DARBY	Isaiah	63	6	And I have trodden down the peoples in mine anger , and made them drunk in my fury ; and their blood have I brought down to the earth .
DARBY	Isaiah	63	7	I will record the loving-kindnesses of Jehovah , the praises of Jehovah , according to all that Jehovah hath bestowed upon us , and the great goodness toward the house of Israel which he hath bestowed upon them according to his mercies , and according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses .
DARBY	Isaiah	63	8	And he said , They are indeed my people , children that will not lie ; and he became their Saviour .
DARBY	Isaiah	63	9	In all their affliction he was afflicted , and the Angel of his presence saved them : in his love and in his pity he redeemed them ; and he bore them and carried them all the days of old .
DARBY	Isaiah	63	10	But they rebelled and grieved his holy Spirit : and he turned to be their enemy ; himself , he fought against them .
DARBY	Isaiah	63	11	But he remembered the days of old , Moses [ and ] his people : Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock ? Where is he that put his holy Spirit within him ,
DARBY	Isaiah	63	12	his glorious arm leading them by the right hand of Moses , dividing the waters before them , to make himself an everlasting name ,
DARBY	Isaiah	63	13	—who led them through the depths , like a horse in the wilderness , [ and ] they stumbled not ?
DARBY	Isaiah	63	14	As cattle go down into the valley , the Spirit of Jehovah gave them rest ; so didst thou lead thy people , to make thyself a glorious name .
DARBY	Isaiah	63	15	Look down from the heavens , and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory ! Where is thy zeal and thy strength , the sounding of thy bowels and of thy tender mercies ? Are they restrained toward me ?
DARBY	Isaiah	63	16	For thou art our Father , though Abraham be ignorant of us , and Israel acknowledge us not : thou , Jehovah , art our Father ; our Redeemer , from everlasting , is thy name .
DARBY	Isaiah	63	17	Why , O Jehovah , hast thou made us to err from thy ways , hast hardened our heart from thy fear ? Return for thy servants ' sake , the tribes of thine inheritance .
DARBY	Isaiah	63	18	Thy holy people have possessed [ it ] but a little while : our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary .
DARBY	Isaiah	63	19	We have become [ like those ] over whom thou never barest rule , those not called by thy name .
DARBY	Isaiah	64	64	Oh , that thou wouldest rend the heavens , that thou wouldest come down , —that the mountains might flow down at thy presence ,
DARBY	Isaiah	64	2	—as fire kindleth brushwood , as the fire causeth water to boil , to make thy name known to thine adversaries , that the nations might tremble at thy presence !
DARBY	Isaiah	64	3	When thou didst terrible things [ which ] we looked not for , thou camest down , and the mountains flowed down at thy presence .
DARBY	Isaiah	64	4	Never have [ men ] heard , nor perceived by the ear , nor hath eye seen a God beside thee , who acteth for him that waiteth for him .
DARBY	Isaiah	64	5	Thou meetest him that rejoiceth to do righteousness , those that remember thee in thy ways : ( behold , thou wast wroth , and we have sinned : ) in those is perpetuity , and we shall be saved .
DARBY	Isaiah	64	6	And we are all become as an unclean [ thing ] , and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags ; and we all fade as a leaf , and our iniquities , like the wind , have carried us away ;
DARBY	Isaiah	64	7	and there is none that calleth upon thy name , that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee ; for thou hast hidden thy face from us , and hast caused us to melt away through our iniquities .
DARBY	Isaiah	64	8	And now , Jehovah , thou art our Father ; we are the clay , and thou our potter ; and we all are the work of thy hand .
DARBY	Isaiah	64	9	Be not wroth very sore , O Jehovah , neither remember iniquity for ever . Behold , see , we beseech thee , we are all thy people .
DARBY	Isaiah	64	10	Thy holy cities are become a wilderness , Zion is a wilderness , Jerusalem a desolation .
DARBY	Isaiah	64	11	Our holy and our beautiful house , where our fathers praised thee , is burnt up with fire , and all our precious things are laid waste .
DARBY	Isaiah	64	12	Wilt thou restrain thyself in presence of these things , Jehovah ? Wilt thou hold thy peace , and afflict us very sore ?
DARBY	Isaiah	65	65	I am sought out of them that inquired not [ for me ] , I am found of them that sought me not ; I have said , Behold me , behold me , unto a nation that was not called by my name .
DARBY	Isaiah	65	2	I have stretched out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people , who walk in a way not good , after their own thoughts ;
DARBY	Isaiah	65	3	the people that provoke me to anger continually to my face , sacrificing in gardens and burning incense upon the bricks ;
DARBY	Isaiah	65	4	who sit down among the graves , and lodge in the secret places ; who eat swine 's flesh , and broth of abominable things [ is in ] their vessels ;
DARBY	Isaiah	65	5	who say , Stand by thyself , come not near to me ; for I am holier than thou . These are a smoke in my nose , a fire that burneth all the day .
DARBY	Isaiah	65	6	Behold , it is written before me : I will not keep silence , but will recompense , even recompense into their bosom ,
DARBY	Isaiah	65	7	your iniquities , and the iniquities of your fathers together , saith Jehovah , who have burned incense upon the mountains , and outraged me upon the hills ; and I will measure their former work into their bosom .
DARBY	Isaiah	65	8	Thus saith Jehovah : As the new wine is found in the cluster , and it is said , Destroy it not , for a blessing is in it ; so will I do for my servants ' sakes , that I may not destroy [ them ] all .
DARBY	Isaiah	65	9	And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob , and out of Judah a possessor of my mountains ; and mine elect shall possess it , and my servants shall dwell there .
DARBY	Isaiah	65	10	And the Sharon shall be a fold for flocks , and the valley of Achor a couching-place of the herds , for my people that have sought me .
DARBY	Isaiah	65	11	But ye who forsake Jehovah , who forget my holy mountain , who prepare a table for Gad , and fill up mixed wine unto Meni :
DARBY	Isaiah	65	12	I will even assign you to the sword , and ye shall all bow down in the slaughter ; because I called , and ye did not answer , I spoke , and ye did not hear ; but ye did what was evil in mine eyes , and chose that wherein I delight not .
DARBY	Isaiah	65	13	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , my servants shall eat , and * ye * shall be hungry ; behold , my servants shall drink , and * ye * shall be thirsty ; behold , my servants shall rejoice , and * ye * shall be ashamed ;
DARBY	Isaiah	65	14	behold , my servants shall sing aloud for gladness of heart , and * ye * shall cry out for sorrow of heart , and shall howl for vexation of spirit .
DARBY	Isaiah	65	15	And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto mine elect ; for the Lord Jehovah will slay thee , and will call his servants by another name :
DARBY	Isaiah	65	16	so that he who blesseth himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of truth ; and he that sweareth in the land shall swear by the God of truth : because the former troubles shall be forgotten , and because they shall be hidden from mine eyes .
DARBY	Isaiah	65	17	For behold , I create new heavens and a new earth ; and the former shall not be remembered , nor come into mind .
DARBY	Isaiah	65	18	But be glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create . For behold , I create Jerusalem a rejoicing , and her people a joy .
DARBY	Isaiah	65	19	And I will rejoice over Jerusalem , and will joy in my people ; and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her , nor the voice of crying .
DARBY	Isaiah	65	20	There shall be no more thenceforth an infant of days , nor an old man that hath not completed his days ; for the youth shall die a hundred years old , and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed .
DARBY	Isaiah	65	21	And they shall build houses , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and eat the fruit thereof :
DARBY	Isaiah	65	22	they shall not build , and another inhabit ; they shall not plant , and another eat : for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people , and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands .
DARBY	Isaiah	65	23	They shall not labour in vain , nor bring forth for terror ; for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah , and their offspring with them .
DARBY	Isaiah	65	24	And it shall come to pass , that before they call , I will answer ; while they are yet speaking , I will hear .
DARBY	Isaiah	65	25	The wolf and the lamb shall feed together , and the lion shall eat straw like the ox ; and dust shall be the serpent 's meat . They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	66	Thus saith Jehovah : The heavens are my throne , and the earth is my footstool : what is the house that ye will build unto me ? and what is the place of my rest ?
DARBY	Isaiah	66	2	Even all these things hath my hand made , and all these things have been , saith Jehovah . But to this man will I look : to the afflicted and contrite in spirit , and who trembleth at my word .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	3	He that slaughtereth an ox , smiteth a man ; he that sacrificeth a lamb , breaketh a dog 's neck ; he that offereth an oblation , [ it is as ] swine 's blood ; he that presenteth a memorial of incense , [ is as ] he that blesseth an idol . As they have chosen their own ways , and their soul delighteth in their abominations ,
DARBY	Isaiah	66	4	I also will choose their calamities , and will bring their fears upon them ; because I called , and none answered , I spoke , and they did not hear , but did that which was evil in mine eyes , and chose that wherein I delight not .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	5	Hear the word of Jehovah , ye that tremble at his word : Your brethren that hated you , that cast you out for my name 's sake , said , Let Jehovah be glorified , and let us see your joy ! but they shall be ashamed .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	6	A voice of tumult from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of Jehovah that rendereth recompence to his enemies !
DARBY	Isaiah	66	7	Before she travailed , she brought forth ; before her pain came , she was delivered of a man-child .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	8	Who hath heard such a thing ? who hath seen such things ? Can a land be made to bring forth in one day ? shall a nation be born at once ? For as soon as Zion travailed , she brought forth her sons .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	9	Shall I bring to the birth , and not cause to bring forth ? saith Jehovah ; I who cause to bring forth , shall I shut [ the womb ] ? saith thy God .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	10	Rejoice with Jerusalem , and be glad for her , all ye that love her ; rejoice for joy with her , all ye that mourn over her :
DARBY	Isaiah	66	11	because ye shall suck , and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations ; because ye shall drink out , and be delighted with the abundance of her glory .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	12	For thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I will extend peace to her like a river , and the glory of the nations like an overflowing torrent ; and ye shall suck , ye shall be carried upon the side , and be dandled upon the knees .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	13	As one whom his mother comforteth , so will I comfort you ; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	14	And ye shall see [ this ] , and your heart shall rejoice , and your bones shall flourish like the grass ; and the hand of Jehovah shall be known toward his servants , and he will have indignation toward his enemies .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	15	For behold , Jehovah will come with fire , and his chariots like a whirlwind , to render his anger with fury , and his rebuke with flames of fire .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	16	For by fire and by his sword will Jehovah enter into judgment with all flesh : and the slain of Jehovah shall be many .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	17	They that sanctify themselves , and purify themselves in the gardens behind one in the midst ; that eat swine 's flesh , and the abomination , and the mouse , shall perish together , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	18	And I , —their works and their thoughts [ are before me ] . … [ The time ] cometh for the gathering of all nations and tongues ; and they shall come , and see my glory .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	19	And I will set a sign among them , and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations , to Tarshish , Pul , and Lud , that draw the bow ; to Tubal and Javan , to the isles afar off , that have not heard my fame , neither have seen my glory : and they shall declare my glory among the nations .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	20	And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations as an oblation unto Jehovah , upon horses , and in chariots , and in covered waggons , and upon mules , and upon dromedaries , to my holy mountain , to Jerusalem , saith Jehovah , as the children of Israel bring an oblation in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	21	And I will also take of them for priests [ and ] for Levites , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	22	For as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make shall remain before me , saith Jehovah , so shall your seed and your name remain .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	23	And it shall come to pass from new moon to new moon , and from sabbath to sabbath , all flesh shall come to worship before me , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Isaiah	66	24	And they shall go forth , and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me : for their worm shall not die , neither shall their fire be quenched ; and they shall be an abhorrence unto all flesh .
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	1	The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkijah , of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin :
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	2	to whom the word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah , in the thirteenth year of his reign ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	3	it came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , king of Judah , unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah , king of Judah , unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive , in the fifth month .
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	4	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	5	Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee ; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I hallowed thee , I appointed thee a prophet unto the nations .
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	6	And I said , Alas , Lord Jehovah ! behold , I can not speak ; for I am a child .
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	7	But Jehovah said unto me , Say not , I am a child ; for thou shalt go to whomsoever I shall send thee , and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak .
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	8	Be not afraid of them ; for I am with thee to deliver thee , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	9	And Jehovah put forth his hand and touched my mouth ; and Jehovah said unto me , Behold , I have put my words in thy mouth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	10	See , I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms , to pluck up , and to break down , and to destroy , and to overthrow , to build and to plant .
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	11	And the word of Jehovah came to me , saying , Jeremiah , what seest thou ? And I said , I see a rod of an almond-tree .
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	12	And Jehovah said unto me , Thou hast well seen ; for I am watchful over my word to perform it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	13	And the word of Jehovah came to me the second time , saying , What seest thou ? And I said , I see a seething-pot , and its face is from the north .
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	14	And Jehovah said unto me , Out of the north shall evil break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	15	For behold , I am calling all the families of the kingdoms of the north , saith Jehovah , and they shall come , and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem , and against all the walls thereof round about , and against all the cities of Judah :
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	16	and I will pronounce my judgments against them for all their wickedness , in that they have forsaken me , and have burned incense unto other gods , and worshipped the works of their own hands .
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	17	Thou , therefore , gird up thy loins , and arise , and speak unto them all that I shall command thee : be not dismayed at them , lest I cause thee to be dismayed before them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	18	And I , behold , I appoint thee this day as a strong city , and an iron pillar , and brazen walls , against the whole land ; against the kings of Judah , against its princes , against its priests , and against the people of the land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	1	19	And they shall fight against thee , but they shall not prevail against thee : for I am with thee , saith Jehovah , to deliver thee .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	2	Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem , saying , Thus saith Jehovah : I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth , the love of thine espousals , when thou wentest after me in the wilderness , in a land not sown .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	3	Israel was holiness unto Jehovah , the first-fruits of his increase : all that devour him are guilty ; evil shall come upon them , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	4	Hear the word of Jehovah , house of Jacob , and all the families of the house of Israel .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	5	Thus saith Jehovah : What injustice have your fathers found in me , that they are gone far from me , and have walked after vanity , and become vain ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	6	And they said not , Where is Jehovah , that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , that led us in the wilderness , in a land of deserts and of pits , in a land of drought and of the shadow of death , in a land that no one passeth through , and where no man dwelleth ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	7	And I brought you into a fruitful land , to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof ; and ye entered and defiled my land , and made my heritage an abomination .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	8	The priests said not , Where is Jehovah ? and they that handled the law knew me not ; and the shepherds transgressed against me ; and the prophets prophesied by Baal , and walked after [ things that ] do not profit .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	9	Therefore will I yet plead with you , saith Jehovah , and with your children 's children will I plead .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	10	For pass over to the isles of Chittim , and see ; and send unto Kedar , and consider diligently , and see if there have been such a thing .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	11	Hath a nation changed [ its ] gods ? and they are no gods ; —but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	12	Be astonished , ye heavens , at this , and shudder ; be amazed very much , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	13	For my people have committed two evils : they have forsaken me , the fountain of living waters , to hew them out cisterns , broken cisterns that hold no water .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	14	Is Israel a bondman ? Is he a home-born [ slave ] ? Why is he become a spoil ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	15	The young lions roared against him , they gave forth their voice , and they made his land desolate : his cities are burned , without inhabitant .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	16	Even the children of Noph and Tahapanes have fed on the crown of thy head .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	17	Hast thou not procured this unto thyself , in that thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God , at the time he was leading thee in the way ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	18	And now , what hast thou to do with the way of Egypt , to drink the waters of Shihor ? And what hast thou to do with the way of Assyria , to drink the waters of the River ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	19	Thine own wickedness chastiseth thee , and thy backslidings reprove thee : know then and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God , and that my fear is not in thee , saith the Lord , Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	20	For of old thou hast broken thy yoke , [ and ] burst thy bands ; and thou saidst , I will not serve . For upon every high hill , and under every green tree , thou bowest down , playing the harlot .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	21	And I , —I had planted thee a noble vine , wholly a right seed ; how then art thou turned into the degenerate shoots of a strange vine unto me ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	22	For though thou wash thee with nitre , and take thee much potash , thine iniquity is marked before me , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	23	How sayest thou , I am not defiled , I have not gone after the Baals ? See thy way in the valley , acknowledge what thou hast done—a swift dromedary traversing her ways !
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	24	—a wild ass , used to the wilderness , that snuffeth up the wind in her desire ! In her ardour , who shall turn her away ? All they that seek her will not weary themselves ; in her month they shall find her .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	25	Withhold thy foot from being unshod , and thy throat from thirst . But thou saidst , There is no hope ; no , for I love strangers , and after them will I go .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	26	As a thief is ashamed when he is found , so shall the house of Israel be ashamed—they , their kings , their princes , and their priests , and their prophets—
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	27	saying to a stock , Thou art my father ; and to a stone , Thou hast brought me forth ; for they have turned the back unto me , and not the face ; and in the time of their trouble they will say , Arise , and save us !
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	28	Where then are thy gods that thou hast made for thyself ? let them arise , if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble : for as the number of thy cities , are thy gods , O Judah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	29	Wherefore would ye contend with me ? Ye all have transgressed against me , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	30	In vain have I smitten your children : they received no correction . Your own sword hath devoured your prophets , like a destroying lion .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	31	O generation , mark ye the word of Jehovah . Have I been a wilderness unto Israel , or a land of thick darkness ? Wherefore say my people , We have dominion ; we will come no more unto thee ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	32	Doth a virgin forget her ornaments , a bride her attire ? But my people have forgotten me days without number .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	33	How dost thou trim thy way to seek love ! Therefore hast thou also accustomed thy ways to wickedness .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	34	Yea , in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor , whom thou didst not encounter breaking in , but [ it is found ] upon all these .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	35	And thou sayest , Indeed I am innocent ; his anger will turn from me . Behold , I will enter into judgment with thee because thou sayest , I have not sinned .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	36	Why dost thou gad about so much , and change thy way ? Thou shalt also be brought to shame by Egypt , as thou wast brought to shame by Assyria .
DARBY	Jeremiah	2	37	Thou shalt indeed go forth from her with thy hands upon thy head ; for Jehovah hath rejected those thou confidest in , and thou shalt not prosper by them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	3	And the showers have been withholden , and there hath been no latter rain ; but thou hast a harlot 's forehead , thou refusest to be ashamed .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	2	Lift up thine eyes unto the heights and see , where hast thou not been lain with ? In the ways hast thou sat for them , as an Arab in the wilderness ; and thou hast polluted the land with thy fornications and with thy wickedness .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	4	Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me , My father , thou art the guide of my youth ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	5	Will he keep [ his anger ] for ever ? Will he preserve it perpetually ? Behold , thou hast spoken and hast done evil things , and thou art [ so ] determined .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	6	And Jehovah said unto me in the days of Josiah the king , Hast thou seen what backsliding Israel hath done ? She hath gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree , and there hath committed fornication .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	7	And I said , After she hath done all these [ things ] , she will return unto me ; but she returned not . And her sister Judah , the treacherous , saw [ it ] .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	8	And I saw that when for all the causes wherein backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away , and given her a bill of divorce , yet the treacherous Judah , her sister , feared not , but went and committed fornication also .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	9	And it came to pass through the lightness of her fornication that she polluted the land , and committed adultery with stones and with stocks .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	10	And even for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart , but with falsehood , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	11	And Jehovah said unto me , Backsliding Israel hath shewn herself more just than treacherous Judah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	12	Go and proclaim these words toward the north , and say , Return , thou backsliding Israel , saith Jehovah : I will not make my face dark upon you ; for I am merciful , saith Jehovah ; I will not keep [ anger ] for ever .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	13	Only acknowledge thine iniquity , that thou hast transgressed against Jehovah thy God , and hast turned thy ways hither and thither to the strangers under every green tree ; and ye have not hearkened to my voice , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	14	Return , backsliding children , saith Jehovah ; for I am a husband unto you , and I will take you , one of a city , and two of a family , and I will bring you to Zion .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	15	And I will give you shepherds according to my heart , and they shall feed you with knowledge and understanding .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	16	And it shall come to pass , when ye are multiplied in the land and become fruitful , in those days , saith Jehovah , they shall say no more , Ark of the covenant of Jehovah ! neither shall it come to mind , nor shall they remember it , nor shall they visit [ it ] ; neither shall it be done any more .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	17	At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah ; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it , to the name of Jehovah , to Jerusalem ; and they shall no more walk after the stubbornness of their evil heart .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	18	In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel ; and they shall come together out of the land of the north , to the land which I caused your fathers to inherit .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	19	And as for me , I said , How shall I put thee among the children , and give thee the pleasant land , the goodly inheritance of the hosts of the nations ? And I said , Thou shalt call me , My father ; and shalt not turn away from following me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	20	Surely [ as ] a woman treacherously departeth from her companion , so have ye dealt treacherously with me , O house of Israel , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	21	A voice is heard upon the heights , the weeping supplications of the children of Israel ; for they have perverted their way , they have forgotten Jehovah their God .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	22	—Return , backsliding children ; I will heal your backslidings . … Behold , we come unto thee ; for thou art Jehovah our God .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	23	Truly in vain [ is salvation looked for ] from the hills , [ and ] the multitude of mountains ; truly in Jehovah our God is the salvation of Israel .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	24	But shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth ; their flocks and their herds , their sons and their daughters .
DARBY	Jeremiah	3	25	We lie down in our shame , and our confusion covereth us ; for we have sinned against Jehovah our God , we and our fathers , from our youth even unto this day , and have not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah our God .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	4	Circumcise yourselves for Jehovah , and take away the foreskins of your heart , ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem ; lest my fury come forth like fire and burn , and there be none to quench it , because of the evil of your doings .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	2	—and thou shalt in truth , in justice , and in righteousness swear , [ As ] Jehovah liveth ! and the nations shall bless themselves in him , and in him shall they glory .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	3	For thus saith Jehovah to the men of Judah and Jerusalem : Break up for you a fallow ground , and sow not among thorns .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	5	Declare ye in Judah , and cause it to be heard in Jerusalem , and say , … and blow the trumpet in the land , cry aloud and say , Assemble yourselves , and let us enter into the fenced cities .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	6	Set up a banner toward Zion ; take to flight , stay not ! For I am bringing evil from the north , and a great destruction .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	7	The lion is come up from his thicket , the destroyer of the nations is on his way ; he is gone forth from his place , to make thy land desolate ; thy cities shall be laid waste , without inhabitant .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	8	For this , gird you with sackcloth , lament and howl ! for the fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned away from us .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	9	And it shall come to pass in that day , saith Jehovah , that the heart of the king shall perish , and the heart of the princes ; and the priests shall be astonished , and the prophets shall be amazed .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	10	And I said , Alas , Lord Jehovah ! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem , saying , Ye shall have peace ; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	11	At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem , A hot wind [ cometh ] from the heights in the wilderness , on the way of the daughter of my people , not for fanning , nor for cleansing .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	12	A wind more vehement than that shall come from me : now will I also pronounce judgments against them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	13	Behold , he cometh up as clouds , and his chariots are as a whirlwind ; his horses are swifter than eagles . Woe unto us ! for we are destroyed .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	14	Wash thy heart , Jerusalem , from wickedness , that thou mayest be saved . How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	15	For a voice declareth from Dan , and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	16	Inform the nations ; behold , make Jerusalem to hear : Besiegers come from a far country , and raise their voice against the cities of Judah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	17	As keepers of a field are they against her round about ; for she hath been rebellious against me , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	18	Thy way and thy doings have procured these [ things ] unto thee ; this is thy wickedness , yea , it is bitter , yea , it reacheth unto thy heart .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	19	My bowels ! my bowels ! I am in travail ! [ Oh , ] the walls of my heart ! My heart maketh a noise in me ; I can not hold my peace : for thou hearest , my soul , the sound of the trumpet , the clamour of war .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	20	Destruction upon destruction is proclaimed ; for the whole land is wasted : suddenly are my tents laid waste , my curtains , in a moment .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	21	How long shall I see the standard , [ and ] hear the sound of the trumpet ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	22	For my people is foolish , they have not known me ; they are sottish children , and they have no intelligence ; they are wise to do evil , but to do good they have no knowledge .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	23	I beheld the earth , and lo , it was waste and empty ; and the heavens , and they had no light .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	24	I beheld the mountains , and lo , they trembled , and all the hills shook violently .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	25	I beheld , and lo , man was not , and all the fowl of the heavens were fled .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	26	I beheld , and lo , the fruitful land was a wilderness , and all the cities thereof were broken down , before Jehovah , before his fierce anger .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	27	For thus saith Jehovah : The whole land shall be a desolation ; but I will not make a full end .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	28	For this shall the earth mourn , and the heavens above be black ; because I have spoken it , I have purposed it , and will not repent , neither will I turn back therefrom .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	29	At the noise of the horsemen and bowmen , every city fleeth ; they go into the thickets , and climb up upon the rocks : every city is forsaken and no man dwelleth therein .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	30	—And thou , wasted one , what wilt thou do ? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson , though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold , though thou rendest thine eyes with paint , in vain dost thou make thyself fair : [ thy ] lovers despise thee , they seek thy life .
DARBY	Jeremiah	4	31	For I hear a voice , as of a woman in travail , anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child , the voice of the daughter of Zion : she moaneth , she spreadeth forth her hands , [ saying ] , Woe unto me ! for my soul faileth because of murderers .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	5	I will go unto the great men , and will speak unto them ; for they know the way of Jehovah , the judgment of their God ; but these have altogether broken the yoke , have burst the bonds .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	2	And if they say , [ As ] Jehovah liveth ! surely they swear falsely .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	3	Jehovah , are not thine eyes upon fidelity ? Thou hast smitten them , but they are not sore ; thou hast consumed them , they have refused to receive correction : they have made their faces harder than a rock ; they have refused to return .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	4	And I said , Surely these are the wretched ones , they are foolish ; for they know not the way of Jehovah , the judgment of their God .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	6	Therefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them , a wolf of the evenings shall waste them ; the leopard lurketh against their cities , every one that goeth out thence is torn in pieces : for their transgressions are multiplied , their backslidings are increased .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	7	Wherefore should I pardon thee ? Thy children have forsaken me , and swear by them that are not God . I have satiated them , and they have committed adultery , and they troop to the harlots ' house .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	8	[ As ] well fed horses , they roam about , every one neigheth after his neighbour 's wife .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	9	Shall I not visit for these things ? saith Jehovah , and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	10	Go up upon her walls , and destroy ; but make not a full end ; take away her battlements , for they are not Jehovah 's .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	11	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	12	They have denied Jehovah , and say , He is not ; and evil shall not come upon us , nor shall we see sword nor famine ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	13	and the prophets shall become wind , and the word is not in them : thus shall it be done unto them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	14	Therefore thus saith Jehovah , the God of hosts : Because ye speak this word , behold , I will make my words in thy mouth fire , and this people wood , and it shall devour them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	15	Behold , I bring a nation upon you from afar , house of Israel , saith Jehovah : it is a mighty nation , it is an ancient nation , a nation whose language thou knowest not , neither understandest thou what they say .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	16	Their quiver is as an open sepulchre ; they are all mighty men .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	17	And they shall eat up thy harvest and thy bread , they shall eat up thy sons and thy daughters , they shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds , they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig-trees ; they shall destroy with the sword thy strong cities , wherein thou trustedst .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	18	Nevertheless in those days , saith Jehovah , I will not make a full end with you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	19	And it shall come to pass , when ye shall say , Wherefore hath Jehovah our God done all these things unto us ? then shalt thou say to them , As ye have forsaken me , and served strange gods in your land , so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	20	Declare this in the house of Jacob , and publish it in Judah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	21	Hear now this , O foolish and heartless people , who have eyes and see not ; who have ears , and hear not .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	22	Will ye not fear me ? saith Jehovah . Will ye not tremble at my presence , who have set the sand a bound for the sea by a perpetual decree , and it shall not pass it ? and its waves toss themselves , but they do not prevail ; and they roar , yet can they not pass over it ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	23	But this people hath a stubborn and a rebellious heart ; they have turned aside and are gone .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	24	And they say not in their heart , Let us now fear Jehovah our God , that giveth rain , both the early and the latter , in its season ; who preserveth unto us the appointed weeks of harvest .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	25	Your iniquities have turned away these things , and your sins have withholden from you what is good .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	26	For among my people are found wicked [ men ] : they lay wait , as fowlers stoop down ; they set a trap , they catch men .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	27	As a cage full of birds , so are their houses full of deceit : therefore they are become great , and have enriched themselves .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	28	They are become fat , they shine , yea , they surpass in deeds of wickedness ; they judge not the cause , the cause of the fatherless , and they prosper ; and the right of the needy do they not adjudge .
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	29	Shall I not visit for these things ? saith Jehovah ; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	30	An appalling and horrible thing is committed in the land :
DARBY	Jeremiah	5	31	the prophets prophesy falsehood , and the priests rule by their means ; and my people love [ to have it ] so . But what will ye do in the end thereof ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	6	For thus hath Jehovah of hosts said : Hew ye down trees , and cast a mound against Jerusalem . She is the city to be visited ; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	2	The comely and delicate one do I cut off , the daughter of Zion .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	3	Shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her ; they shall pitch [ their ] tents against her round about ; they shall feed every one in his place .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	4	Prepare war against her . Arise , and let us go up at noon . Woe unto us ! for the day hath declined , for the shadows of the evening are lengthening .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	5	Arise , and let us go up by night , and let us destroy her palaces .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	7	As a well poureth forth her waters , so she poureth forth her wickedness : violence and destruction are heard in her ; before me continually are grief and wounds .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	8	Be thou instructed , Jerusalem , lest my soul be alienated from thee ; lest I make thee a desolation , a land not inhabited .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	9	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : They shall thoroughly glean like a vine the remnant of Israel : turn back thy hand , as a grape-gatherer unto the baskets .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	10	To whom shall I speak and testify , that they may hear ? Behold , their ear is uncircumcised , and they can not hearken : behold , the word of Jehovah is unto them a reproach ; they have no delight in it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	11	And I am full of the fury of Jehovah , I am weary with holding in . Pour it out upon the children in the street , and upon the assembly of young men together : for even the husband with the wife shall be taken ; the aged with him [ that is ] full of days .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	12	And their houses shall be turned unto others , [ their ] fields and wives together ; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	13	For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them , every one is given to covetousness ; and from the prophet even unto the priest , every one dealeth falsely .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	14	And they have healed the breach of the daughter of my people lightly , saying , Peace , peace ! when there is no peace .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	15	Are they ashamed that they have committed abomination ? Nay , they are not at all ashamed , neither know they what it is to blush . Therefore they shall fall among them that fall ; at the time that I visit them they shall stumble , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	16	Thus saith Jehovah : Stand in the ways and see , and ask for the ancient paths , which is the good way , and walk therein , and ye shall find rest for your souls . But they said , We will not walk [ therein ] .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	17	Also I have set watchmen over you : —Hearken ye to the sound of the trumpet . But they said , We will not hearken .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	18	Therefore hear , ye nations , and know , O assembly , what is among them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	19	Hear , O earth : behold , I will bring evil upon this people , the fruit of their thoughts ; for they have not hearkened unto my words , and as to my law , they have rejected it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	20	To what purpose should there come to me incense from Sheba , and the sweet cane from a far country ? Your burnt-offerings are not acceptable , nor are your sacrifices pleasing unto me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	21	Therefore thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people , and the fathers and the sons together shall fall over them ; the neighbour and his friend shall perish .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	22	Thus saith Jehovah : Behold , a people cometh from the north country , and a great nation is stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	23	They lay hold on bow and spear ; they are cruel , and have no mercy ; their voice roareth like the sea ; and they ride upon horses , set in array as a man for the battle , against thee , daughter of Zion .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	24	We have heard the report thereof : our hands are grown feeble ; anguish hath taken hold of us , pain as of a woman that travaileth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	25	Go not forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for [ there is ] the sword of the enemy , terror is on every side .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	26	Daughter of my people , gird thee with sackcloth , and roll thyself in ashes : make mourning , [ as ] for an only son—bitter lamentation ; for the spoiler cometh suddenly upon us .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	27	I have set thee among my people as an assayer , a fortress , that thou mayest know and try their way .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	28	They are all the most rebellious of rebels , going about with slander : they are bronze and iron ; they are all corrupters .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	29	The bellows are burned , the lead is consumed by the fire ; they have melted , and melted in vain ; and the bad are not plucked away .
DARBY	Jeremiah	6	30	Reprobate silver shall they call them , for Jehovah hath rejected them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	7	then will I cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that I gave to your fathers from of old even for ever .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	2	Stand in the gate of Jehovah 's house , and proclaim there this word , and say , Hear ye the word of Jehovah , all Judah , that enter in at these gates to worship Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	3	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Amend your ways and your doings , and I will cause you to dwell in this place .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	4	Confide ye not in words of falsehood , saying , Jehovah 's temple , Jehovah 's temple , Jehovah 's temple is this .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	5	But if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings , if ye really do justice between a man and his neighbour ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	6	[ if ] ye oppress not the stranger , the fatherless , and the widow , and shed no innocent blood in this place , neither walk after other gods to your hurt ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	8	Behold , ye confide in words of falsehood that can not profit .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	9	What ? steal , murder , and commit adultery , and swear falsely , and burn incense unto Baal , and walk after other gods whom ye know not …
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	10	then ye come and stand before me , in this house which is called by my name , and say , We are delivered , —in order to do all these abominations !
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	11	Is this house , which is called by my name , a den of robbers in your eyes ? Even I , behold , I have seen it , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	12	For go now unto my place which was in Shiloh , where I caused my name to dwell at the first , and see what I did to it , for the wickedness of my people Israel .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	13	And now , because ye have done all these works , saith Jehovah , and I spoke unto you , rising up early and speaking , and ye heard not , and I called you , and ye answered not ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	14	I will even do unto the house which is called by my name , wherein ye trust , and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers , as I have done to Shiloh ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	15	and I will cast you out of my sight , as I have cast out all your brethren , all the seed of Ephraim .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	16	And thou , pray not for this people , neither lift up cry nor prayer for them , and make not intercession to me ; for I will not hear thee .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	17	Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	18	The children gather wood , and the fathers kindle the fire , and the women knead dough , to make cakes to the queen of heaven , and to pour out drink-offerings unto other gods , that they may provoke me to anger .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	19	Is it I whom they provoke to anger ? saith Jehovah ; is it not themselves , to the shame of their own face ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	20	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place ; upon man , and upon beast , and upon the trees of the field , and upon the fruit of the ground ; and it shall burn , and shall not be quenched .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	21	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Add your burnt-offerings to your sacrifices , and eat the flesh .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	22	For I spoke not unto your fathers , nor commanded them concerning burnt-offerings and sacrifices , in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	23	but I commanded them this thing , saying , Hearken unto my voice , and I will be your God , and ye shall be my people ; and walk in all the way that I command you , that it may be well with you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	24	But they hearkened not , nor inclined their ear , but walked in the counsels , in the stubbornness of their evil heart , and went backward and not forward .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	25	Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt , unto this day , have I sent unto you all my servants the prophets , daily rising up early and sending them ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	26	but they have not hearkened unto me , nor inclined their ear ; and they have hardened their neck : they have done worse than their fathers .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	27	And thou shalt speak all these words unto them , but they will not hearken unto thee ; and thou shalt call unto them , but they will not answer thee .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	28	And thou shalt say unto them , This is the nation which hath not hearkened unto the voice of Jehovah their God , nor received correction ; fidelity is perished , and is cut off from their mouth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	29	Cut off thy hair , and cast it away , and take up a lamentation on the heights ; for Jehovah hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	30	For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight , saith Jehovah ; they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name , to defile it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	31	And they have built the high places of Topheth , which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire ; which I commanded not , neither did it come up into my mind .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	32	Therefore , behold , days are coming , saith Jehovah , when it shall no more be said , Topheth , and Valley of the son of Hinnom , but the valley of slaughter ; for they shall bury in Topheth , till there be no place .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	33	And the carcases of this people shall be food for the fowl of the heavens , and for the beasts of the earth ; and none shall scare [ them ] away .
DARBY	Jeremiah	7	34	And I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah , and from the streets of Jerusalem , the voice of mirth and the voice of joy , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride ; for the land shall become a waste .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	8	How do ye say , We are wise , and the law of Jehovah is with us ? Behold , certainly the lying pen of the scribes hath made it falsehood .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	2	and they shall spread them out to the sun and to the moon and to all the host of the heavens , which they have loved , and which they have served , and after which they have walked , and which they have sought , and which they have worshipped : they shall not be gathered , nor be buried ; they shall be for dung upon the face of the ground .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	3	And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family , in all the places whither I have driven those that remain , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	4	And thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith Jehovah : Do [ men ] fall , and not rise up ? Doth one turn away , and not return ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	5	Why hath this people of Jerusalem slidden back with a perpetual backsliding ? They hold fast deceit , they refuse to return .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	6	I hearkened and heard : they speak not what is right ; there is no man who repenteth him of his wickedness , saying , What have I done ? Every one turneth to his course , like a horse rushing into the battle .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	7	Even a stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times , and the turtle-dove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming ; but my people know not the judgment of Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	9	The wise men are ashamed , they are dismayed and taken : behold , they have rejected Jehovah 's word ; and what wisdom is in them ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	10	Therefore will I give their wives unto others , their fields to those that shall possess [ them ] ; for every one , from the least even unto the greatest , is given to covetousness ; from the prophet even unto the priest , every one dealeth falsely .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	11	And they have healed the breach of the daughter of my people lightly , saying , Peace , peace ! when there is no peace .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	12	Are they ashamed that they have committed abomination ? Nay , they are not at all ashamed , and they know not how to blush . Therefore shall they fall among them that fall : in the time of their visitation they shall stumble , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	13	I will utterly take them away , saith Jehovah : there are no grapes on the vine , nor figs on the fig-tree ; and the leaf is faded : and I will give them up to those that shall pass over them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	14	Why do we sit still ? Assemble yourselves , and let us enter into the fenced cities , and let us be silent there : for Jehovah our God hath put us to silence , and given us water of gall to drink , because we have sinned against Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	15	Peace is looked for , and there is no good ; a time of healing , and behold , terror .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	16	The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan : the whole land trembleth at the sound of the neighing of his steeds , and they come , and devour the land , and all it contains , the city and those that dwell therein .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	17	For behold , I send among you serpents , vipers against which there is no charm , and they shall bite you , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	18	My comfort in my sadness ! my heart is faint in me !
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	19	Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people , from a very far country : Is not Jehovah in Zion ? Is not her king in her ? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images , with foreign vanities ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	20	The harvest is past , the summer is ended , and we are not saved .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	21	—For the breach of the daughter of my people am I crushed ; I go mourning ; astonishment hath taken hold of me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	8	22	Is there no balm in Gilead ? is there no physician there ? Why then is there no dressing applied for the healing of the daughter of my people ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	9	Shall I not visit them for these [ things ] ? saith Jehovah ; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	2	Oh that I had in the wilderness a traveller 's lodging-place , that I might leave my people , and go away from them ! For they are all adulterers , an assembly of treacherous men .
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	3	And they bend their tongue , their bow of falsehood , and not for fidelity are they valiant in the land ; for they proceed from evil to evil , and they know not me , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	4	Take ye heed every one of his friend , and confide not in any brother ; for every brother only supplanteth , and every friend goeth about with slander .
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	5	And they act deceitfully every one with his neighbour , and speak not the truth : they teach their tongue to speak falsehood , they weary themselves with perverse dealing .
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	6	Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit ; through deceit they refuse to know me , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	7	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Behold , I will melt them , and try them ; for how else could I do for the daughter of my people ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	8	Their tongue is a murderous arrow ; it speaketh deceit . [ A man ] speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth , but in his heart he layeth his ambush .
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	10	For the mountains will I take up weeping and wailing , and for the pastures of the wilderness , a lamentation ; for they are burnt up , so that none passeth through them ; and the voice of the cattle is not heard . Both the fowl of the heavens and the beasts are fled ; they are gone .
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	11	And I will make Jerusalem heaps , a dwelling-place of jackals ; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation , without inhabitant .
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	12	Who is a wise man , that he may understand this ? and he to whom the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken , that he may declare it ? Why is the land perished , burnt up like a wilderness , so that none passeth through ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	13	And Jehovah saith , Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them , and have not hearkened unto my voice , nor walked in it ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	14	but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart , and after the Baals , as their fathers taught them ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	15	therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel , Behold , I will feed this people with wormwood , and give them water of gall to drink ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	16	and will scatter them among the nations , whom neither they nor their fathers have known ; and I will send the sword after them , till I have consumed them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	17	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Consider , and call for the mourning women , that they may come , and send for the skilful women , that they may come ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	18	and let them make haste , and take up a wailing for us , that our eyes may run down with tears , and our eyelids pour forth waters .
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	19	For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion , How are we spoiled , sorely put to shame ! For we have forsaken the land , for they have cast down our dwellings .
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	20	Hear then the word of Jehovah , ye women , and let your ear receive the word of his mouth , and teach your daughters wailing , and each one her companion lamentation .
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	21	For death is come up through our windows , is entered into our palaces , to cut off the children from the street , the young men from the broadways .
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	22	Speak , Thus saith Jehovah : Yea , the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field , and as the handful after the reaper , and there shall be none to gather .
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	23	Thus saith Jehovah : Let not the wise glory in his wisdom , neither let the mighty glory in his might ; let not the rich glory in his riches :
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	24	but let him that glorieth glory in this , that he understandeth and knoweth me , that I [ am ] Jehovah , who exercise loving-kindness , judgment , and righteousness in the earth ; for in these things I delight , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	25	Behold , days are coming , saith Jehovah , when I will visit all [ them that are ] circumcised with the uncircumcised ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	9	26	Egypt , and Judah , and Edom , and the children of Ammon , and Moab , and all that have the corners [ of their beard ] cut off , that dwell in the wilderness : for all the nations are uncircumcised , and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	10	But Jehovah Elohim is truth ; he is the living God , and the King of eternity . At his wrath the earth trembleth , and the nations can not abide his indignation .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	2	Thus saith Jehovah : Learn not the way of the nations , and be not dismayed at the signs of the heavens ; for the nations are dismayed at them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	3	For the statutes of the peoples are vanity ; for [ it is ] a tree cut out of the forest , worked with a chisel by the hands of the artizan ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	4	they deck it with silver and with gold ; they fasten it with nails and with hammers , that it move not .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	5	They are as a palm-column of turned work , and they speak not ; they are carried , for they can not go . Be not afraid of them ; for they can not do evil , neither also is it in them to do good .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	6	There is none like unto thee , Jehovah ; thou art great , and thy name is great in might .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	7	Who would not fear thee , O King of nations ? For to thee doth it appertain ; for among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their kingdoms , there is none like unto thee .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	8	But they are one and all senseless and foolish ; the teaching of vanities is a stock .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	9	Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish , and gold from Uphaz , the work of the artizan and of the hands of the founder ; blue and purple is their clothing : they are all the work of skilful [ men ] .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	11	Thus shall ye say unto them : The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth , these shall perish from the earth , and from under the heavens .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	12	He hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and hath stretched out the heavens by his understanding .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	13	When he uttereth his voice , there is a tumult of waters in the heavens , and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the end of the earth ; he maketh lightnings for the rain , and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	14	Every man is become brutish , bereft of knowledge ; every founder is put to shame by the graven image , for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	15	They are vanity , a work of delusion : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	16	The portion of Jacob is not like them ; for it is he that hath formed all [ things ] , and Israel is the rod of his inheritance : Jehovah of hosts is his name .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	17	Gather up thy baggage out of the land , O inhabitress of the fortress .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	18	For thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I will this time sling out the inhabitants of the land , and will distress them , that they may be found .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	19	Woe is me , for my wound ! My stroke is hard to heal , and I had said , Yea , this is [ my ] grief , and I will bear it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	20	My tent is despoiled , and all my cords are broken ; my children are gone forth from me , and they are not ; there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	21	For the shepherds are become brutish , and have not sought Jehovah ; therefore have they not acted wisely , and all their flock is scattered .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	22	The voice of a rumour ! Behold , it cometh , and a great commotion out of the north country , to make the cities of Judah a desolation , a dwelling-place of jackals .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	23	I know , Jehovah , that the way of man is not his own ; it is not in a man that walketh to direct his steps .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	24	Jehovah , correct me , but with judgment ; not in thine anger , lest thou bring me to nothing .
DARBY	Jeremiah	10	25	Pour out thy fury upon the nations that know thee not , and upon the families that call not on thy name ; for they have eaten up Jacob , yea , they have eaten him up and consumed him , and have laid waste his dwelling-place .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	11	Therefore thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I will bring evil upon them , from which they shall not be able to escape ; and they will cry unto me , and I will not hearken unto them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	2	Hear ye the words of this covenant ; and speak ye unto the men of Judah , and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	3	And thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith Jehovah , the God of Israel : Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	4	which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , from the iron furnace , saying , Hearken unto my voice and do them , according to all that I command you ; so shall ye be my people , and I will be your God :
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	5	that I may perform the oath that I have sworn unto your fathers , to give them a land flowing with milk and honey , as it is this day . And I answered and said , Amen , Jehovah !
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	6	And Jehovah said unto me , Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem , saying : Hear the words of this covenant , and do them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	7	For I earnestly protested unto your fathers , in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt , unto this day , rising early and protesting , saying , Hearken unto my voice .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	8	But they have not hearkened , nor inclined their ear , but have walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart ; and I have brought upon them all the words of this covenant , which I commanded [ them ] to do , and they have not done .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	9	And Jehovah said unto me , A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah , and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	10	They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers , who refused to hear my words ; and they have gone after other gods to serve them . The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	12	Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they have burned incense ; but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	13	For [ as ] the number of thy cities , are thy gods , O Judah ; and [ as ] the number of the streets of Jerusalem , have ye set up altars to the Shame , altars to burn incense unto Baal .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	14	And thou , pray not for this people , neither lift up cry nor prayer for them ; for I will not hear in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	15	What hath my beloved to do in my house , seeing that the more part practise their evil devices , and the holy flesh is passed from thee ? When thou doest evil , then thou rejoicest .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	16	Jehovah had called thy name , A green olive-tree , fair , of goodly fruit : with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it , and its branches are broken .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	17	For Jehovah of hosts , that planted thee , hath pronounced evil against thee , for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah , which they have done for themselves , to provoke me to anger in burning incense unto Baal .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	18	And Jehovah hath given me knowledge , and I know [ it ] ; then thou shewedst me their doings .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	19	And I was like a tame lamb [ that ] is led to the slaughter ; and I knew not that they devised devices against me , [ saying , ] Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof , and let us cut him off from the land of the living , that his name may be no more remembered .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	20	But thou , Jehovah of hosts , who judgest righteously , who triest the reins and the heart , let me see thy vengeance on them : for unto thee have I revealed my cause .
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	21	Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the men of Anathoth , that seek thy life , saying , Prophesy not in the name of Jehovah , that thou die not by our hand ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	22	—therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Behold , I punish them : the young men shall die by the sword ; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	11	23	and there shall be no remnant of them ; for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth , in the year of their visitation .
DARBY	Jeremiah	12	12	Spoilers are come upon all heights in the wilderness ; for the sword of Jehovah devoureth from one end of the land even to the [ other ] end of the land : no flesh hath peace .
DARBY	Jeremiah	12	2	Thou hast planted them , they also have taken root : they advance , yea , they bring forth fruit : thou art near in their mouth , but far from their reins .
DARBY	Jeremiah	12	3	But thou , Jehovah , knowest me ; thou hast seen me , and proved my heart toward thee . Drag them out like sheep for the slaughter , and set them apart for the day of slaughter .
DARBY	Jeremiah	12	4	How long shall the land mourn , and the herbs of all the fields wither ? Because of the wickedness of them that dwell therein , the beasts and the birds perish ; for they say , He will not see our end .
DARBY	Jeremiah	12	5	If thou hast run with footmen , and they have wearied thee , how wilt thou then contend with horses ? And if in a land of peace thou thinkest thyself in security , how wilt thou then do in the swelling of the Jordan ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	12	6	For even thy brethren , and the house of thy father , even they have dealt treacherously with thee , even they have cried aloud after thee . Believe them not , though they speak good [ words ] unto thee .
DARBY	Jeremiah	12	7	I have forsaken my house , I have cast off my heritage , I have given the beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies .
DARBY	Jeremiah	12	8	My heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest ; it hath raised its voice against me : therefore have I hated it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	12	9	My heritage is unto me [ as ] a speckled bird of prey ; the birds of prey round about are against her . Go , assemble all the beasts of the field , bring them to devour .
DARBY	Jeremiah	12	10	Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard , they have trodden my portion under foot , they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness :
DARBY	Jeremiah	12	11	they have made it a desolation ; desolate , it mourneth unto me : the whole land is made desolate , for no man layeth it to heart .
DARBY	Jeremiah	12	13	They have sown wheat , and they reap thorns ; they have put themselves to pain , [ and ] do not profit . Be ye therefore ashamed of your revenues , because of the fierce anger of Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	12	14	Thus saith Jehovah against all mine evil neighbours , that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit : Behold , I will pluck them up out of their land , and pluck out the house of Judah from among them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	12	15	And it shall come to pass , after I have plucked them up , I will return , and have compassion on them , and will bring them back , each one to his inheritance , and each one to his land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	12	16	And it shall come to pass , if they will diligently learn the ways of my people , to swear by my name , [ As ] Jehovah liveth—even as they taught my people to swear by Baal—they shall be built up in the midst of my people .
DARBY	Jeremiah	12	17	And if they will not obey , I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	13	And thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I will fill all the inhabitants of this land , and the kings that sit for David upon his throne , and the priests and the prophets , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , with drunkenness .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	2	And I bought a girdle according to the word of Jehovah , and put it upon my loins .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	3	And the word of Jehovah came unto me the second time , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	4	Take the girdle that thou hast bought , which is upon thy loins , and arise , go to the Euphrates , and hide it there in a hole of the rock .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	5	So I went and hid it by the Euphrates , as Jehovah had commanded me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	6	And it came to pass at the end of many days , that Jehovah said unto me , Arise , go to the Euphrates , and take the girdle from thence which I commanded thee to hide there .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	7	And I went to the Euphrates , and digged , and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it ; and behold , the girdle was spoiled , it was good for nothing .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	8	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	9	Thus saith Jehovah : After this manner will I spoil the pride of Judah , and the great pride of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	10	This evil people , who refuse to hear my words , who walk in the stubbornness of their heart , and go after other gods , to serve them and to worship them , shall even be as this girdle which is good for nothing .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	11	For as a girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man , so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah , saith Jehovah ; that they might be unto me for a people , and for a name , and for a praise , and for a glory : but they would not hear .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	12	And thou shalt speak unto them this word : Thus saith Jehovah , the God of Israel , Every skin shall be filled with wine . And they will say unto thee , Do we not very well know that every skin shall be filled with wine ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	14	And I will dash them one against another , both the fathers and the sons together , saith Jehovah ; I will not pity , nor spare , nor have mercy so as not to destroy them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	15	Hear ye , and give ear , be not lifted up ; for Jehovah hath spoken .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	16	Give glory to Jehovah your God , before he cause darkness , and before your feet stumble upon the mountains of twilight ; and ye shall look for light , but he will turn it into the shadow of death , and make [ it ] gross darkness .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	17	And if ye will not hear it , my soul shall weep in secret places for [ your ] pride ; and mine eye shall weep sore , and run down with tears , because Jehovah 's flock is gone into captivity .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	18	Say unto the king and to the queen : Humble yourselves , sit down low ; for from your heads shall come down the crown of your magnificence .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	19	The cities of the south are shut up , and there is none to open [ them ] ; all Judah is carried away captive : it is wholly carried away captive .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	20	Lift up your eyes , and behold them that come from the north . Where is the flock that was given thee , thy beautiful flock ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	21	What wilt thou say when he shall visit thee , since thou thyself hast trained them to be princes in chief over thee ? Shall not sorrows take thee , as a woman in travail ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	22	And if thou say in thy heart , Wherefore come these things upon me ? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts uncovered , [ and ] thy heels have suffered violence .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	23	Can an Ethiopian change his skin , or a leopard his spots ? [ Then ] may ye also do good , who are accustomed to do evil .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	24	And I will scatter them as stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	25	This shall be thy lot , thy measured portion from me , saith Jehovah ; because thou hast forgotten me , and confided in falsehood .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	26	Therefore will I also turn thy skirts over thy face , and thy shame shall be seen .
DARBY	Jeremiah	13	27	Thine adulteries , and thy neighings , the lewdness of thy fornication , on the hills , in the fields , —thine abominations , have I seen . Woe unto thee , Jerusalem ! Wilt thou not be made clean ? after how long a time yet ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	14	And Jehovah said unto me , The prophets prophesy falsehood in my name ; I have not sent them , neither have I commanded them , nor spoken unto them : they prophesy unto you a false vision , and divination , and a thing of nought , and the deceit of their heart .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	2	Judah mourneth , and the gates thereof languish , they are black unto the ground ; and the cry of Jerusalem goeth up .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	3	And their nobles send their little ones for water : they come to the pits , they find no water ; they return with their vessels empty ; they are ashamed , they are confounded , and have covered their heads .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	4	Because the ground is chapt , for there hath been no rain on the earth , the ploughmen are ashamed , they cover their heads .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	5	For the hind also calveth in the field , and forsaketh [ its young ] , because there is no grass .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	6	And the wild asses stand on the heights , they snuff up the wind like jackals ; their eyes fail , because there is no herbage .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	7	Jehovah , though our iniquities testify against us , do thou act for thy name 's sake ; for our backslidings are many—we have sinned against thee .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	8	Thou hope of Israel , its Saviour in the time of trouble , why wilt thou be as a stranger in the land , and as a traveller that turneth aside to stay a night ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	9	Why wilt thou be as a man astonished , as a mighty man that can not save ? Yet thou , Jehovah , art in the midst of us , and we are called by thy name : leave us not .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	10	Thus saith Jehovah to this people : Even so have they loved to wander , they have not refrained their feet ; and Jehovah hath no delight in them : now will he remember their iniquity , and visit their sins .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	11	And Jehovah said unto me , Pray not for this people for their good .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	12	When they fast , I will not hear their cry ; and when they offer up burnt-offering and oblation , I will not accept them : for I will consume them by sword , and by famine , and by pestilence .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	13	And I said , Alas , Lord Jehovah ! Behold , the prophets say unto them , Ye shall not see the sword , neither shall ye have famine ; for I will give you assured peace in this place .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	15	Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name , and I sent them not , and who say , Sword and famine shall not be in this land : By sword and by famine shall those prophets be consumed ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	16	and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem , because of the famine and the sword ; and there shall be none to bury them , them , their wives , and their sons , and their daughters ; and I will pour their wickedness upon them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	17	And thou shalt say this word unto them : Let mine eyes run down with tears , night and day , and not cease ; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very grievous blow .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	18	If I go forth into the field , behold the slain with the sword ! and if I enter into the city , behold them that pine away with famine ! For both prophet and priest shall go about into a land that they know not .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	19	—Hast thou then utterly rejected Judah ? Doth thy soul loathe Zion ? Why hast thou smitten us , and there is no healing for us ? Peace is looked for , and there is no good , —and a time of healing , and behold terror !
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	20	Jehovah , we acknowledge our wickedness , the iniquity of our fathers ; for we have sinned against thee .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	21	For thy name 's sake , do not spurn [ us ] , do not disgrace the throne of thy glory : remember , break not thy covenant with us .
DARBY	Jeremiah	14	22	Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain ? or can the heavens give showers ? Art not thou HE , Jehovah , our God ? And we wait upon thee ; for thou hast made all these things .
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	15	Jehovah , thou knowest : remember me , and visit me , and avenge me of my persecutors ; in thy long-suffering take me not away : know that for thy sake I bear reproach .
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	2	And it shall come to pass , if they say unto thee , Whither shall we go forth ? then thou shalt tell them , Thus saith Jehovah : Such as are for death , to death ; and such as are for the sword , to the sword ; and such as are for the famine , to the famine ; and such as are for captivity , to captivity .
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	3	For I will visit them with four kinds [ of punishments ] , saith Jehovah : the sword to slay , and dogs to tear , and the fowl of the heavens , and the beasts of the earth , to devour and to destroy .
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	4	And I will give them over to be driven hither and thither amongst all the kingdoms of the earth , because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah , king of Judah , for that which he did in Jerusalem .
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	5	For who shall have pity upon thee , Jerusalem ? and who shall bemoan thee ? and who shall turn aside to ask after thy welfare ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	6	Thou hast cast me off , saith Jehovah , thou art gone backward ; and I have stretched out my hand against thee , and will destroy thee : I am become weary of repenting .
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	7	And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I will bereave of children [ and ] destroy my people : they have not returned from their ways .
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	8	Their widows are increased to me more than the sand of the seas ; I have brought upon them , against the mother of the young men , a spoiler at noonday ; I have caused anguish and terror to fall upon her suddenly .
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	9	She that hath borne seven languisheth , she hath given up the ghost ; her sun is gone down while it is yet day ; she is put to shame and confounded . And the residue of them will I give up to the sword before their enemies , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	10	Woe is me , my mother , that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole land ! I have not lent on usury , nor have they lent to me on usury ; [ yet ] every one of them doth curse me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	11	Jehovah said , Verily I will set thee free for [ thy ] good ; verily I will cause the enemy to meet thee kindly in the time of evil and in the time of affliction .
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	12	Will iron break ? iron from the north ? and bronze ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	13	Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price , and that for all thy sins , and in all thy borders ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	14	and I will make [ them ] to pass with thine enemies into a land that thou knowest not : for a fire is kindled in mine anger ; it shall burn upon you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	16	Thy words were found , and I did eat them , and thy words were unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart ; for I am called by thy name , O Jehovah , God of hosts .
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	17	I sat not in the assembly of the mockers , nor exulted : I sat alone because of thy hand ; for thou hast filled me with indignation .
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	18	Why is my pain perpetual , and my wound incurable ? It refuseth to be healed . Wilt thou be altogether unto me as a treacherous [ spring ] , [ as ] waters that fail ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	19	Therefore thus saith Jehovah : If thou return , then will I bring thee again , thou shalt stand before me ; and if thou take forth the precious from the vile , thou shalt be as my mouth . Let them return unto thee ; but return not thou unto them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	20	And I will make thee unto this people a strong brazen wall ; and they shall fight against thee , but they shall not prevail against thee : for I am with thee , to save thee and to deliver thee , saith Jehovah ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	15	21	yea , I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked , and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible .
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	16	Behold , I will send for many fishers , saith Jehovah , and they shall fish them ; and afterwards will I send for many hunters , and they shall hunt them , from every mountain , and from every hill , and out of the holes of the rocks .
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	2	Thou shalt not take thee a wife , and thou shalt not have sons nor daughters in this place .
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	3	For thus saith Jehovah concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place , and concerning their mothers that bear them , and concerning their fathers that beget them in this land :
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	4	They shall die of painful deaths ; they shall not be lamented , neither shall they be buried ; they shall be as dung upon the face of the ground , and they shall be consumed by the sword , and by famine , and their carcases shall be food for the fowl of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	5	For thus saith Jehovah : Enter not into the house of wailing , neither go to lament or bemoan them ; for I have taken away my peace from this people , saith Jehovah , the loving-kindness and the tender mercies .
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	6	Both great and small shall die in this land : they shall not be buried ; and none shall lament for them , or cut themselves , nor make themselves bald for them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	7	Nor shall they break [ bread ] for them in mourning , to comfort them for the dead ; neither shall they give them the cup of consolations to drink for their father or for their mother .
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	8	And thou shalt not go into the house of feasting , to sit with them , to eat and to drink .
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	9	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Behold , I will cause to cease out of this place , before your eyes , and in your days , the voice of mirth and the voice of joy , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride .
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	10	And it shall come to pass , when thou shalt declare unto this people all these words , and they shall say unto thee , Wherefore hath Jehovah pronounced all this great evil against us ? and what is our iniquity ? and what is our sin which we have committed against Jehovah our God ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	11	then shalt thou say unto them , Because your fathers have forsaken me , saith Jehovah , and have walked after other gods , and have served them , and have worshipped them , and have forsaken me , and have not kept my law ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	12	and you , ye have done still worse than your fathers ; and there ye are walking every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart , not to hearken unto me :
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	13	and I will cast you forth out of this land , into a land that ye know not , ye nor your fathers ; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night : because I will shew you no favour .
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	14	Therefore , behold , days are coming , saith Jehovah , that it shall no more be said , [ As ] Jehovah liveth , who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	15	but , [ As ] Jehovah liveth , who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north , and from all the lands whither he had driven them . For I will bring them again into their land , which I gave unto their fathers .
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	17	For mine eyes are upon all their ways ; they are not concealed from my face , neither is their iniquity hidden from before mine eyes .
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	18	But first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double , because they have profaned my land with the carcases of their detestable things , and with their abominations have they filled mine inheritance .
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	19	Jehovah , my strength and my fortress , and my refuge in the day of distress , unto thee shall the nations come from the ends of the earth , and they shall say , Surely our fathers have inherited falsehood [ and ] vanity ; and in these things there is no profit .
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	20	Shall a man make gods unto himself , and they are no-gods ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	16	21	Therefore , behold , I will this once cause them to know , I will cause them to know my hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	17	Be not a terror unto me : thou art my refuge in the day of evil .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	2	whilst their children remember their altars and their Asherahs , by the green trees , upon the high hills .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	3	My mountain in the field , thy substance , all thy treasures will I give for a spoil , —thy high places , because of sin throughout thy borders .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	4	And of thyself thou shalt let go thine inheritance which I gave thee ; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in a land that thou knowest not ; for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger , —it shall burn for ever .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	5	Thus saith Jehovah : Cursed is the man that confideth in man , and maketh flesh his arm , and whose heart departeth from Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	6	And he shall be like the heath in the desert , and shall not see when good cometh ; but he shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness , a salt land and not inhabited .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	7	Blessed is the man that confideth in Jehovah , and whose confidence Jehovah is .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	8	For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters , and that spreadeth out its roots by the stream , and he shall not see when heat cometh , but his leaf shall be green ; and in the year of drought he shall not be careful , neither shall he cease to yield fruit .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	9	The heart is deceitful above all things , and incurable ; who can know it ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	10	I Jehovah search the heart , I try the reins , even to give each one according to his ways , according to the fruit of his doings .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	11	[ As ] the partridge sitteth on [ eggs ] it hath not laid , [ so ] is he that getteth riches and not by right : in the midst of his days shall he leave them , and at his end shall be a fool .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	12	A throne of glory , [ set ] on high from the beginning , is the place of our sanctuary .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	13	Thou hope of Israel , Jehovah ! all that forsake thee shall be ashamed . They that depart from me shall be written in the earth ; because they have forsaken Jehovah , the fountain of living waters .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	14	Heal me , Jehovah , and I shall be healed ; save me , and I shall be saved : for thou art my praise .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	15	Behold , these say unto me , Where is the word of Jehovah ? let it then come !
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	16	But as for me , I have not hastened from being a shepherd in following thee , neither have I desired the fatal day , thou knowest : that which came out of my lips was before thy face .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	18	Let them be ashamed that persecute me , but let not me be ashamed ; let them be dismayed , but let not me be dismayed ; bring upon them the day of evil , and break them with a double breaking .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	19	Thus hath Jehovah said unto me : Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people , by which the kings of Judah come in , and by which they go out , and in all the gates of Jerusalem ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	20	and say unto them , Hear the word of Jehovah , ye kings of Judah , and all Judah , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , that enter in by these gates ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	21	thus saith Jehovah : Take heed to your souls , and bear no burden on the sabbath day , and bring nothing in through the gates of Jerusalem ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	22	and carry forth no burden out of your houses on the sabbath day , neither do any work ; but hallow ye the sabbath day , as I commanded your fathers ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	23	but they hearkened not , neither inclined their ear , but hardened their neck , that they might not hear nor receive instruction .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	24	And it shall come to pass , if ye diligently hearken unto me , saith Jehovah , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day , and to hallow the sabbath day , to do no work therein ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	25	then shall there enter in , through the gates of this city , kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David , riding in chariots and on horses , they and their princes , the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem : and this city shall be inhabited for ever .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	26	And they shall come from the cities of Judah , and from the places around Jerusalem , and from the land of Benjamin , and from the lowland , and from the hill-country , and from the south , bringing burnt-offerings , and sacrifices , and oblations , and incense , and bringing thanksgiving unto the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	17	27	But if ye will not hearken unto me , to hallow the sabbath day and not to bear a burden and enter in through the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day , then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof , and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem , and it shall not be quenched .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	18	And they said , Come , and let us devise devices against Jeremiah ; for law shall not perish from the priest , nor counsel from the wise , nor word from the prophet . Come and let us smite him with the tongue , and let us not give heed to any of his words .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	2	Arise and go down to the potter 's house , and there I will cause thee to hear my words .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	3	And I went down to the potter 's house ; and behold , he wrought a work on the wheels .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	4	And the vessel that he made was marred , as clay , in the hand of the potter ; and he made it again another vessel , as seemed good to the potter to make .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	5	And the word of Jehovah came to me , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	6	House of Israel , can not I do with you as this potter ? saith Jehovah . Behold , as the clay in the potter 's hand , so are ye in my hand , house of Israel .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	7	At the moment that I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom , to pluck up , and to break down , and to destroy ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	8	if that nation , concerning which I have spoken , turn from their evil , then I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	9	And at the moment that I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom , to build and to plant ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	10	if it do evil in my sight , that it hearken not unto my voice , then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	11	And now , speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , saying , Thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I prepare evil against you , and devise a device against you : turn ye then every one from his evil way , and amend your ways and your doings .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	12	But they say , There is no hope ; for we will walk after our own devices , and we will each one do [ according to ] the stubbornness of his evil heart .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	13	Therefore thus saith Jehovah : Ask ye now among the nations , Who hath heard such things ? The virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	14	Shall the snow of Lebanon cease from the rock of the field ? Shall the cool flowing waters coming from afar be dried up ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	15	For my people hath forgotten me : they burn incense to vanity ; and they have caused them to stumble in their ways , the ancient paths , to walk in by-paths of a way not cast up ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	16	to make their land an astonishment , a perpetual hissing : every one that passeth by shall be astonished , and shake his head .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	17	As with an east wind will I scatter them before the enemy ; I will shew them the back , and not the face , in the day of their calamity .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	19	Jehovah , give heed to me , and listen to the voice of those that contend with me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	20	Shall evil be recompensed for good ? For they have digged a pit for my soul . Remember how I stood before thee to speak good for them , to turn away thy wrath from them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	21	Therefore give up their children to the famine , and deliver them over to the power of the sword ; and let their wives be bereaved of children and be widows ; and let their men be swept off by death , their young men be smitten by the sword in battle .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	22	Let a cry be heard from their houses , when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them ; for they have digged a pit to take me , and have hidden snares for my feet .
DARBY	Jeremiah	18	23	And thou , Jehovah , knowest all their counsel against me to slay me . Forgive not their iniquity , neither blot out their sin from thy sight , but let them be overthrown before thee : deal with them in the time of thine anger .
DARBY	Jeremiah	19	19	Thus saith Jehovah : Go and buy a potter 's earthen flagon , and [ take ] of the elders of the people , and of the elders of the priests ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	19	2	and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom , which is by the entry of the pottery-gate , and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	19	3	and say , Hear the word of Jehovah , O kings of Judah , and inhabitants of Jerusalem . Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Behold , I will bring evil upon this place , the which whosoever heareth , his ears shall tingle ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	19	4	because they have forsaken me , and have estranged this place [ from me ] , and have burned incense in it unto other gods , whom neither they nor their fathers have known , nor the kings of Judah ; and have filled this place with the blood of innocents ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	19	5	and they have built the high places of Baal , to burn their sons in the fire as burnt-offerings unto Baal , which I commanded not , nor spake it , neither came it up into my mind :
DARBY	Jeremiah	19	6	therefore behold , days come , saith Jehovah , that this place shall no more be called Topheth , nor Valley of the son of Hinnom , but the valley of slaughter .
DARBY	Jeremiah	19	7	And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place ; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies , and by the hand of them that seek their life , and their carcases will I give as food to the fowl of the heavens and to the beasts of the earth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	19	8	And I will make this city an astonishment and a hissing ; every one that passeth by shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof .
DARBY	Jeremiah	19	9	And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters , and they shall eat everyone the flesh of his friend , in the siege and in the straitness wherewith their enemies , and they that seek their lives , shall straiten them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	19	10	And thou shalt break the flagon in the sight of the men that go with thee ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	19	11	and shalt say unto them , Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Even so will I break this people and this city , as one breaketh a potter 's vessel , that can not be made whole again . And they shall bury in Topheth , till there be no place to bury .
DARBY	Jeremiah	19	12	Thus will I do unto this place , saith Jehovah , and to the inhabitants thereof , and make this city as Topheth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	19	13	And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah shall be as the place of Topheth , defiled , all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of the heavens , and have poured out drink-offerings unto other gods .
DARBY	Jeremiah	19	14	And Jeremiah came from Topheth , whither Jehovah had sent him to prophesy ; and he stood in the court of Jehovah 's house , and said to all the people ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	19	15	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Behold , I will bring upon this city and upon all her cities all the evil that I have spoken against it ; for they have hardened their necks , not to hear my words .
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	20	And Pashur the son of Immer , the priest—and he was chief officer in the house of Jehovah—heard Jeremiah prophesy these things .
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	2	And Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin , which was in the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	3	And it came to pass the next day , that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks ; and Jeremiah said unto him , Jehovah hath not called thy name Pashur , but Magor-missabib .
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	4	For thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I make thee a terror to thyself , and to all thy friends ; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies , and thine eyes shall see [ it ] ; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall carry them captive into Babylon , and shall smite them with the sword .
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	5	And , I will give all the wealth of this city , and all its gains , and all its precious things , and all the treasures of the kings of Judah , will I give into the hand of their enemies ; and they shall make them a prey , and take them , and carry them to Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	6	And thou , Pashur , and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity ; and thou shalt come to Babylon , and there thou shalt die , and there thou shalt be buried , thou and all thy friends to whom thou hast prophesied falsehood .
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	7	Jehovah , thou hast enticed me , and I was enticed ; thou hast laid hold of me , and hast prevailed ; I am become a derision the whole day : every one mocketh me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	8	For as oft as I speak , I cry out ; I proclaim violence and spoil ; for the word of Jehovah is become unto me a reproach and a derision all the day .
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	9	And I said , I will not make mention of him , nor speak any more in his name : but it was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones ; and I became wearied with holding in , and I could not .
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	10	For I have heard the defaming of many , terror on every side : Report , and we will report it . All my familiars are watching for my stumbling : Peradventure he will be enticed , and we shall prevail against him ; and we shall take our revenge on him .
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	11	But Jehovah is with me as a mighty terrible one ; therefore my persecutors shall stumble and shall not prevail ; they shall be greatly ashamed , for they have not prospered : it shall be an everlasting confusion that shall not be forgotten .
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	12	And thou , Jehovah of hosts , who triest the righteous , who seest the reins and the heart , let me see thy vengeance on them ; for unto thee have I revealed my cause .
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	13	Sing ye unto Jehovah , praise Jehovah , for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers .
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	14	Cursed be the day wherein I was born ; let not the day wherein my mother bore me be blessed !
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	15	Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father , saying , A man child is born unto thee ; making him very glad !
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	16	And let that man be as the cities which Jehovah overthrew , and repented not ; and let him hear a cry in the morning , and a shouting at noonday ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	17	because he slew me not from the womb . Or would that my mother had been my grave , and her womb always great [ with me ] !
DARBY	Jeremiah	20	18	Wherefore came I forth from the womb to see labour and sorrow , that my days should be consumed in shame ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	21	21	The word that came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah , when king Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Malchijah , and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah , the priest , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	21	2	Inquire , I pray thee , of Jehovah for us ; for Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon maketh war against us ; if so be that Jehovah will deal with us according to all his marvellous works , that he may go up from us .
DARBY	Jeremiah	21	3	And Jeremiah said unto them , Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah :
DARBY	Jeremiah	21	4	Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel : Behold , I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands , with which ye fight against the king of Babylon , and against the Chaldeans who besiege you , outside the walls , and I will assemble them into the midst of this city .
DARBY	Jeremiah	21	5	And I myself will fight against you with a stretched-out hand , and with a strong arm , and in anger , and in fury , and in great wrath .
DARBY	Jeremiah	21	6	And I will smite the inhabitants of this city , both man and beast : they shall die of a great pestilence .
DARBY	Jeremiah	21	7	And afterwards , saith Jehovah , I will give Zedekiah king of Judah , and his servants , and the people , and such as are left in this city from the pestilence , from the sword , and from the famine , into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon , and into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of those that seek their life , and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword : he shall not spare them , neither have pity , nor have mercy .
DARBY	Jeremiah	21	8	And unto this people thou shalt say , Thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I set before you the way of life , and the way of death .
DARBY	Jeremiah	21	9	He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence ; but he that goeth out , and deserteth to the Chaldeans that besiege you , he shall live , and his life shall be unto him for a prey .
DARBY	Jeremiah	21	10	For I have set my face against this city for evil , and not for good , saith Jehovah : it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire .
DARBY	Jeremiah	21	11	And touching the house of the king of Judah , hear ye the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	21	12	House of David , thus saith Jehovah : Judge with justice in the morning , and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor , lest my fury go forth like fire and burn , and there be none to quench it , because of the evil of your doings .
DARBY	Jeremiah	21	13	Behold , I am against thee , inhabitress of the valley , the rock of the plain , saith Jehovah ; ye that say , Who shall come down against us , or who shall enter into our dwellings ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	21	14	And I will visit you according to the fruit of your doings , saith Jehovah ; and I will kindle a fire in her forest , and it shall devour all that is round about her .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	22	The wind shall feed on all thy shepherds , and thy lovers shall go into captivity ; surely , then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	2	and say , Hear the word of Jehovah , O king of Judah , that sittest upon the throne of David , thou , and thy servants , and thy people who enter in through these gates .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	3	Thus saith Jehovah : Execute judgment and righteousness , and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor ; and do no wrong , do no violence to the stranger , the fatherless , or the widow , and shed not innocent blood in this place .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	4	For if ye do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in through the gates of this house kings sitting in the place of David upon his throne , riding in chariots and on horses , —he , and his servants , and his people .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	5	But if ye will not hear these words , I have sworn by myself , saith Jehovah , that this house shall become a waste .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	6	For thus saith Jehovah concerning the house of the king of Judah : Thou art a Gilead unto me , the summit of Lebanon : verily I will make thee a wilderness , cities not inhabited .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	7	And I will prepare destroyers against thee , every one with his weapons ; and they shall cut down the choice of thy cedars , and cast [ them ] into the fire .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	8	And many nations shall pass by this city , and they shall say every man to his neighbour , Wherefore hath Jehovah done thus unto this great city ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	9	And they shall say , Because they have forsaken the covenant of Jehovah their God , and worshipped other gods , and served them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	10	Weep not for the dead , neither bemoan him ; [ but ] weep sore for him that goeth away , for he shall return no more , nor see his native country .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	11	For thus saith Jehovah concerning Shallum the son of Josiah , the king of Judah , who reigned instead of Josiah his father , who went forth out of this place : He shall not return thither any more ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	12	for he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive , and shall see this land no more .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	13	Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness , and his upper chambers by injustice ; that taketh his neighbour 's service without wages , and giveth him not his earning ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	14	that saith , I will build me a wide house , and spacious upper chambers ; and he cutteth out for himself windows ; and it is wainscoted with cedar , and painted with vermilion .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	15	Shalt thou reign , because thou viest with the cedar ? Did not thy father eat and drink , and do judgment and justice ? Then it was well with him .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	16	He judged the cause of the poor and needy ; then it was well . Was not this to know me ? saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	17	But thine eyes and thy heart are only on thine extortion , and on the blood of the innocent , to shed it , and on oppression and on violence , to do it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	18	Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , the king of Judah : They shall not lament for him , Ah , my brother ! or , Ah , sister ! They shall not lament for him , Ah , lord ! or Ah , his glory !
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	19	He shall be buried with the burial of an ass , dragged along and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	20	Go up to Lebanon , and cry ; and give forth thy voice in Bashan , and cry from [ the heights of ] Abarim : for all thy lovers are destroyed .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	21	I spoke unto thee in thy prosperity ; [ but ] thou saidst , I will not hear . This hath been thy way from thy youth , that thou hearkenedst not unto my voice .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	23	Thou inhabitress of Lebanon , that makest thy nest in the cedars , how pitiful shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee , pain as of a woman in travail !
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	24	[ As ] I live , saith Jehovah , though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim , the king of Judah , were a signet upon my right hand , yet will I pluck thee thence ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	25	and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life , and into the hand of them before whom thou art afraid , even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of the Chaldeans .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	26	And I will cast thee out , and thy mother that bare thee , into another country , where ye were not born ; and there shall ye die .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	27	And into the land whereunto they lift up their souls to return , thither shall they not return .
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	28	Is this man Coniah a despised broken vase ? a vessel wherein is no delight ? Wherefore are they thrown out , he and his seed , and are cast into a land which they know not ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	29	O earth , earth , earth , hear the word of Jehovah !
DARBY	Jeremiah	22	30	Thus saith Jehovah : Write this man childless , a man that shall not prosper in his days ; for no man of his seed shall prosper , sitting upon the throne of David , and ruling any more in Judah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	23	Am I a God at hand , saith Jehovah , and not a God afar off ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	2	Therefore thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel concerning the shepherds that feed my people : Ye have scattered my flock , and driven them away , and have not visited them : behold , I will visit upon you the evil of your doings , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	3	And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them , and will bring them again to their pastures ; and they shall be fruitful and shall multiply .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	4	And I will raise up shepherds over them , who shall feed them ; and they shall fear no more , nor be dismayed , neither shall any be missing , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	5	Behold , the days come , saith Jehovah , when I will raise unto David a righteous Branch , who shall reign as king , and act wisely , and shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	6	In his days Judah shall be saved , and Israel shall dwell in safety ; and this is his name whereby he shall be called , Jehovah our Righteousness .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	7	Therefore behold , days are coming , saith Jehovah , that they shall no more say , [ As ] Jehovah liveth , who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	8	but , [ As ] Jehovah liveth , who brought up and who led back the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country , and from all countries whither I had driven them . And they shall dwell in their own land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	9	Concerning the prophets : My heart within me is broken ; all my bones shake ; I am like a drunken man , and like a man whom wine hath overcome ; because of Jehovah , and because of the words of his holiness .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	10	For the land is full of adulterers ; for because of execration the land mourneth . The pastures of the wilderness are dried up ; for their course is evil , and their force is not right .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	11	For both prophet and priest are profane : even in my house have I found their wickedness , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	12	Therefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places in the darkness ; they shall be driven on , and fall therein : for I will bring evil upon them in the year of their visitation , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	13	And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria : they prophesied by Baal , and caused my people Israel to err .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	14	And in the prophets of Jerusalem have I seen a horrible thing : they commit adultery , and walk in falsehood , and strengthen the hands of evildoers , so that none doth return from his wickedness . They are all become unto me as Sodom , and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	15	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the prophets : Behold , I will feed them with wormwood , and make them drink water of gall ; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	16	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you : they lead you to vanity ; they speak a vision of their own heart , not out of the mouth of Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	17	They say constantly unto them that despise me , Jehovah hath said , Ye shall have peace . And they say unto every one that walketh in the stubbornness of his heart , No evil shall come upon you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	18	For who hath stood in the council of Jehovah , so that he hath perceived and heard his word ? who hath hearkened to his word and listened ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	19	Behold , a tempest of Jehovah , fury is gone forth , yea , a whirling storm : it shall whirl down upon the head of the wicked .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	20	The anger of Jehovah shall not return , until he have executed , and until he have performed the purposes of his heart : at the end of the days ye shall understand it clearly .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	21	I did not send the prophets , yet they ran ; I have not spoken to them , yet they prophesied .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	22	But if they had stood in my council , and had caused my people to hear my words , then would they have turned them from their evil way and from the wickedness of their doings .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	24	Can any hide himself in secret places , that I shall not see him ? saith Jehovah . Do not I fill the heavens and the earth ? saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	25	I have heard what the prophets say , who prophesy falsehood in my name , saying , I have dreamed , I have dreamed .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	26	How long shall [ this ] be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy falsehood , and who are prophets of the deceit of their own heart ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	27	who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour : as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	28	The prophet that hath a dream , let him tell the dream ; and he that hath my word , let him speak my word faithfully . What is the chaff to the wheat ? saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	29	Is not my word like a fire , saith Jehovah ; and like a hammer [ that ] breaketh the rock in pieces ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	30	Therefore , behold , I am against the prophets , saith Jehovah , that steal my words every one from his neighbour .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	31	Behold , I am against the prophets , saith Jehovah , that use their tongues , and say , He hath said .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	32	Behold , I am against them that prophesy false dreams , saith Jehovah , and that tell them , and cause my people to err by their lies and by their boasting ; and I have not sent them , nor commanded them ; and they profit not this people at all , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	33	And when this people , or a prophet , or a priest , ask thee , saying , What is the burden of Jehovah ? thou shalt then say unto them , What burden ? I will even cast you off , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	34	And as for the prophet , and the priest , and the people , that shall say , The burden of Jehovah , I will even punish that man and his house .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	35	Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour , and every one to his brother : What hath Jehovah answered ? and , What hath Jehovah spoken ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	36	And the burden of Jehovah shall ye mention no more ; for every man 's own word shall be his burden : for ye have perverted the words of the living God , of Jehovah of hosts , our God .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	37	Thus shalt thou say to the prophet : What hath Jehovah answered thee ? and , What hath Jehovah spoken ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	38	But since ye say , The burden of Jehovah , therefore thus saith Jehovah : Because ye say this word , The burden of Jehovah , and I have sent unto you , saying , Ye shall not say , The burden of Jehovah ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	39	therefore behold , I will utterly forget you , and I will cast you off , far from my face , and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers .
DARBY	Jeremiah	23	40	And I will bring everlasting reproach upon you , and everlasting shame , that shall not be forgotten .
DARBY	Jeremiah	24	24	Jehovah shewed me , and behold , two baskets of figs , set before the temple of Jehovah , after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive from Jerusalem , Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , the king of Judah , and the princes of Judah , and the craftsmen and smiths , and had brought them to Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	24	2	One basket had very good figs , like the figs first ripe ; and the other basket had very bad figs , which could not be eaten for badness .
DARBY	Jeremiah	24	3	And Jehovah said unto me , What seest thou , Jeremiah ? And I said , Figs : the good figs very good ; and the bad very bad , which can not be eaten for badness .
DARBY	Jeremiah	24	4	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	24	5	Thus saith Jehovah , the God of Israel : Like these good figs , so will I regard for good them that are carried away captive of Judah , whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	24	6	and I will set mine eyes upon them for good , and I will bring them again to this land ; and I will build them and not pull them down , and I will plant them and not pluck them up .
DARBY	Jeremiah	24	7	And I will give them a heart to know me , that I am Jehovah ; and they shall be my people , and I will be their God : for they shall return unto me with their whole heart .
DARBY	Jeremiah	24	8	And as the bad figs , which can not be eaten for badness , surely , thus saith Jehovah : So will I make Zedekiah the king of Judah , and his princes , and the remnant of Jerusalem , that remain in this land , and them that dwell in the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Jeremiah	24	9	And I will give them over to be driven hither and thither unto all the kingdoms of the earth for evil , to be a reproach and a proverb , a taunt and a curse , in all places whither I shall drive them ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	24	10	and I will send among them the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , until they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	25	and all the kings of Zimri , and all the kings of Elam , and all the kings of the Medes ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	2	which Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , saying :
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	3	From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon , the king of Judah , even unto this day , these three and twenty years , the word of Jehovah hath come unto me , and I have spoken unto you , rising early and speaking ; but ye have not hearkened .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	4	And Jehovah hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets , rising early and sending ; but ye have not hearkened , nor inclined your ear to hear ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	5	when they said , Turn again now every one from his evil way , and from the wickedness of your doings , and dwell in the land that Jehovah hath given unto you and to your fathers from of old even for ever .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	6	And go not after other gods , to serve them and to worship them ; and provoke me not to anger with the work of your hands ; and I will do you no hurt .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	7	But ye have not hearkened unto me , saith Jehovah ; that ye might provoke me to anger with the work of your hands , to your own hurt .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	8	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Because ye have not listened to my words ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	9	behold , I will send and take all the families of the north , saith Jehovah , and [ I will send ] to Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon , my servant , and will bring them against this land , and against the inhabitants thereof , and against all these nations round about ; and I will utterly destroy them , and make them an astonishment , and a hissing , and perpetual wastes .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	10	And I will cause to perish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of joy , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride , the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	11	And this whole land shall become a waste , an astonishment ; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	12	And it shall come to pass , when seventy years are accomplished , [ that ] I will visit on the king of Babylon and on that nation , saith Jehovah , their iniquity , and on the land of the Chaldeans , and I will make it perpetual desolations .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	13	And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , all that is written in this book , which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	14	For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also ; and I will recompense them according to their deeds , and according to the work of their hands .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	15	For thus hath Jehovah the God of Israel said unto me : Take the cup of the wine of this fury at my hand , and cause all the nations to whom I send thee to drink it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	16	And they shall drink , and reel to and fro , and be mad , because of the sword that I will send among them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	17	And I took the cup at Jehovah 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , to whom Jehovah had sent me :
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	18	Jerusalem , and the cities of Judah , and the kings thereof , and the princes thereof , to make them a waste , an astonishment , a hissing , and a curse , as it is this day ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	19	Pharaoh king of Egypt , and his servants , and his princes , and all his people ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	20	and all the mingled people , and all the kings of the land of Uz , and all the kings of the land of the Philistines , and Ashkelon , and Gazah , and Ekron , and the remnant of Ashdod ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	21	Edom , and Moab , and the children of Ammon ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	22	and all the kings of Tyre , and all the kings of Zidon , and the kings of the isles that are beyond the sea ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	23	Dedan , and Tema , and Buz , and all that have the corners [ of their beard ] cut off ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	24	and all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	26	and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another ; and all the kingdoms of the world , which are upon the face of the earth ; and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	27	And thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Drink , and be drunken , and vomit , and fall , and rise no more , because of the sword that I will send among you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	28	And it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup from thy hand to drink , then shalt thou say unto them , Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Ye shall certainly drink .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	29	For behold , I begin to bring evil on the city that is called by my name , and should ye be altogether unpunished ? Ye shall not be unpunished ; for I call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	30	And thou , prophesy unto them all these words , and say unto them , Jehovah will roar from on high , and utter his voice from his holy habitation ; he will mightily roar upon his dwelling-place , he will give a shout , as they that tread [ the vintage ] , against all the inhabitants of the earth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	31	The noise shall come to the end of the earth : for Jehovah hath a controversy with the nations , he entereth into judgment with all flesh ; as for the wicked , he will give them up to the sword , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	32	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Behold , evil shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great storm shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	33	And the slain of Jehovah shall [ be ] at that day from [ one ] end of the earth even unto the [ other ] end of the earth : they shall not be lamented , neither gathered , nor buried ; they shall be dung upon the face of the ground .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	34	Howl , ye shepherds , and cry ; and wallow yourselves [ in the dust ] , noble ones of the flock : for the days of your slaughter are accomplished , and I will disperse you ; and ye shall fall like a precious vessel .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	35	And refuge shall perish from the shepherds , and escape from the noble ones of the flock .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	36	There shall be a voice of the cry of the shepherds , and a howling of the noble ones of the flock : for Jehovah layeth waste their pasture ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	37	and the peaceable enclosures shall be desolated , because of the fierce anger of Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	25	38	He hath forsaken his covert as a young lion ; for their land is a desolation because of the fierceness of the oppressor , and because of his fierce anger .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	26	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , the king of Judah , came this word from Jehovah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	2	Thus saith Jehovah : Stand in the court of Jehovah 's house , and speak unto all the cities of Judah , which come to worship in Jehovah 's house , all the words that I command thee to speak unto them : diminish not a word .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	3	Peradventure they will hearken , and turn every man from his evil way , that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do unto them because of the wickedness of their doings .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	4	And thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith Jehovah : If ye will not hearken unto me , to walk in my law , which I have set before you ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	5	to hearken unto the words of my servants the prophets , whom I have sent unto you , even rising early and sending [ them ] , but ye have not hearkened ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	6	—then will I make this house like Shiloh , and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	7	And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	8	And it came to pass when Jeremiah had ended speaking all that Jehovah had commanded [ him ] to speak unto all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him , saying , Thou shalt certainly die .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	9	Why hast thou prophesied in the name of Jehovah , saying , This house shall be like Shiloh , and this city shall be desolate , without inhabitant ? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	10	And the princes of Judah heard these things ; and they went up from the king 's house unto the house of Jehovah , and sat in the entry of the new gate of Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	11	And the priests and the prophets spoke unto the princes and to all the people , saying , This man is worthy to die , for he hath prophesied against this city , as ye have heard with your ears .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	12	And Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people , saying , Jehovah sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	13	And now , amend your ways and your doings , and hearken to the voice of Jehovah your God ; and Jehovah will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	14	But as for me , behold , I am in your hand ; do unto me as seemeth good and right in your eyes :
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	15	only know for certain that if ye put me to death , ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves , and upon this city , and upon the inhabitants thereof ; for of a truth Jehovah hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	16	And the princes and all the people said unto the priests and to the prophets , This man is not worthy to die ; for he hath spoken to us in the name of Jehovah our God .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	17	And there rose up certain of the elders of the land and spoke to all the congregation of the people , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	18	Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah , and spoke to all the people of Judah , saying , Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Zion shall be ploughed [ as ] a field , and Jerusalem shall become heaps , and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	19	Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death ? Did he not fear Jehovah , and supplicate Jehovah , and Jehovah repented him of the evil that he had pronounced against them ? And we should be doing a great evil against our souls .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	20	And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of Jehovah , Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim : and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	21	and Jehoiakim the king , and all his mighty men , and all the princes , heard his words , and the king sought to put him to death ; but Urijah heard it , and he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	22	And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt , Elnathan the son of Achbor , and men with him , into Egypt ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	23	and they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt , and brought him to Jehoiakim the king ; and he slew him with the sword , and cast his dead body into the graves of the children of the people .
DARBY	Jeremiah	26	24	—Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	27	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , the king of Judah , came this word to Jeremiah from Jehovah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	2	Thus hath Jehovah said unto me : Make thee bonds and yokes , and put them upon thy neck ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	3	and send them to the king of Edom , and to the king of Moab , and to the king of the children of Ammon , and to the king of Tyre , and to the king of Zidon , by the hand of the messengers that come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	4	And give them a charge unto their masters , saying , Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Thus shall ye say unto your masters :
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	5	I have made the earth , man and beast that are upon the face of the earth , by my great power and by my outstretched arm ; and I give them unto whom it seemeth right in mine eyes .
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	6	And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , my servant ; and the beasts of the field also have I given him to serve him .
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	7	And all the nations shall serve him , and his son , and his son 's son , until the time of his land also come , when many nations and great kings shall reduce him to servitude .
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	8	And it shall come to pass , that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon , that nation will I visit , saith Jehovah , with the sword , and with the famine , and with the pestilence , until I have consumed them by his hand .
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	9	And ye , hearken not to your prophets , nor to your diviners , nor to your dreamers , nor to your soothsayers , nor to your sorcerers , who speak unto you saying : Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	10	For they prophesy falsehood unto you , to remove you far from your land , and that I should drive you out , and ye should perish .
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	11	But the nation that bringeth its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serveth him , will I let remain still in its own land , saith Jehovah ; and they shall till it , and dwell therein .
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	12	And I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words , saying , bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon , and serve him and his people , and live .
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	13	Why will ye die , thou and thy people , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , as Jehovah hath spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	14	And hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you , saying , Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon ; for they prophesy falsehood unto you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	15	For I have not sent them , saith Jehovah , yet they prophesy falsely in my name ; in order that I should drive you out , and that ye should perish , ye , and the prophets who prophesy unto you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	16	And I spoke to the priests and to all this people , saying , Thus saith Jehovah : Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you , saying , Behold , the vessels of Jehovah 's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon ; for they prophesy falsehood unto you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	17	Hearken not unto them ; serve the king of Babylon , and live : wherefore should this city become a waste ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	18	But if they be prophets , and if the word of Jehovah be with them , let them now make intercession to Jehovah of hosts , that the vessels which are left in the house of Jehovah , and in the house of the king of Judah , and at Jerusalem , go not to Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	19	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the pillars , and concerning the sea , and concerning the bases , and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	20	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not , when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , the king of Judah , from Jerusalem to Babylon , along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	21	yea , thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel , concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Jehovah , and in the house of the king of Judah , and in Jerusalem :
DARBY	Jeremiah	27	22	They shall be carried to Babylon , and there shall they be until the day of my visiting them , saith Jehovah ; then I will bring them up , and restore them to this place .
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	28	And it came to pass the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the fourth year , in the fifth month , [ that ] Hananiah the son of Azzur , the prophet , who was of Gibeon , spoke to me in the house of Jehovah , in the presence of the priests and of all the people , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	2	Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel , saying , I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	3	Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Jehovah 's house , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place , and carried to Babylon ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	4	and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim , the king of Judah , with all the captives of Judah that went to Babylon , saith Jehovah : for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	5	And the prophet Jeremiah spoke unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests , and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	6	And the prophet Jeremiah said , Amen , may Jehovah do so ! may Jehovah perform thy words which thou hast prophesied , to bring again from Babylon , into this place , the vessels of Jehovah 's house , and all them of the captivity !
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	7	Nevertheless , hear , I pray thee , this word which I speak in thine ears , and in the ears of all the people :
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	8	The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old , prophesied also concerning many countries and concerning great kingdoms , of war , and of evil , and of pestilence .
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	9	The prophet that prophesieth of peace , when the word of the prophet shall come to pass , shall be known as the prophet whom Jehovah hath really sent .
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	10	And the prophet Hananiah took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah 's neck , and broke it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	11	And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people , saying , Thus saith Jehovah : So will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations . And the prophet Jeremiah went his way .
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	12	And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah , after that the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	13	Go and tell Hananiah , saying , Thus saith Jehovah : Thou hast broken the yokes of wood , and thou hast made in their place yokes of iron .
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	14	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations , that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ; and they shall serve him : and I have given him the beasts of the field also .
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	15	And the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah , Hear now , Hananiah : Jehovah hath not sent thee ; and thou makest this people to trust in falsehood .
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	16	Therefore thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I will cast thee from off the face of the earth : this year thou shalt die , for thou hast spoken revolt against Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	28	17	And the prophet Hananiah died in the same year in the seventh month .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	29	—And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of the prophet Jeremiah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	2	( after that Jeconiah the king , and the queen , and the eunuchs , the princes of Judah and Jerusalem , and the craftsmen , and the smiths , had departed from Jerusalem ) ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	3	by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan , and Gemariah the son of Hilkijah ( whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon , unto Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon ) , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	4	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel , unto all the captivity , whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon :
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	5	Build houses , and dwell in them , and plant gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	6	Take wives , and beget sons and daughters ; and take wives for your sons , and give your daughters to husbands , that they may bear sons and daughters ; and multiply there , and be not diminished .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	7	And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captive , and pray unto Jehovah for it : for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	8	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Let not your prophets that are in your midst , nor your diviners deceive you , neither hearken to your dreams , which ye like to dream .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	9	For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name : I have not sent them , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	10	For thus saith Jehovah : When seventy years shall be accomplished for Babylon I will visit you , and perform my good word toward you , in bringing you back to this place .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	11	For I know the thoughts that I think toward you , saith Jehovah , thoughts of peace , and not of evil , to give you in your latter end a hope .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	12	And ye shall call upon me , and ye shall go and pray unto me , and I will hearken unto you ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	13	and ye shall seek me and find me , for ye shall search for me with all your heart ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	14	and I will be found of you , saith Jehovah . And I will turn your captivity , and I will gather you from all the nations , and from all the places whither I have driven you , saith Jehovah ; and I will bring you again into the place whence I have caused you to be carried away captive .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	15	If ye say , Jehovah hath raised us up prophets in Babylon ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	16	yea , thus saith Jehovah concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of David , and concerning all the people that dwell in this city , your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	17	thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Behold , I will send against them the sword , the famine , and the pestilence , and will make them like the vile figs , that can not be eaten for badness .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	18	And I will pursue them with the sword , with the famine , and with the pestilence , and will give them over to be driven hither and thither into all the kingdoms of the earth , to be an execration , and an astonishment , and a hissing , and a reproach , among all the nations whither I will drive them :
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	19	because they have not hearkened to my words , saith Jehovah , wherewith I sent unto them my servants the prophets , rising early and sending ; but ye have not hearkened , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	20	But ye , all ye of the captivity , whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon , hear the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	21	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel , concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah , and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah , who prophesy falsehood unto you in my name : Behold , I will give them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and he shall smite them before your eyes .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	22	And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah that are in Babylon , saying , Jehovah make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab , whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	23	because they have committed infamy in Israel , and have committed adultery with their neighbours ' wives , and have spoken words of falsehood in my name , which I had not commanded them : and I [ am ] he that knoweth , and [ am ] witness , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	24	And thou shalt speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	25	Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel , saying , Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem , and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest , and to all the priests , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	26	Jehovah hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest , that there should be officers [ in ] the house of Jehovah , over every madman and self-made prophet , that thou shouldest put him in the stocks and in the shackles .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	27	And now , why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth , who maketh himself a prophet to you ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	28	Forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in Babylon , saying , It will be long ; build houses , and dwell [ in them ] , and plant gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	30	And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	31	Send to all them of the captivity , saying , Thus saith Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite : Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you , and I sent him not , and he hath caused you to trust in falsehood ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	29	32	therefore thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite , and his seed : he shall not have a man to dwell among this people ; neither shall he see the good that I will do for my people , saith Jehovah ; because he hath spoken revolt against Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	30	The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	2	Thus speaketh Jehovah the God of Israel , saying , Write thee in a book all the words that I have spoken unto thee .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	3	For behold , the days come , saith Jehovah , when I will turn the captivity of my people Israel and Judah , saith Jehovah ; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers , and they shall possess it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	4	And these are the words that Jehovah hath spoken concerning Israel and concerning Judah ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	5	for thus saith Jehovah : We have heard a voice of trembling , there is fear , and no peace .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	6	Ask ye now , and see , whether a male doth travail with child ? Wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins , as a woman in travail ; and all faces are turned into paleness ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	7	Alas ! for that day is great , so that none is like it : it is even the time of Jacob 's trouble ; but he shall be saved out of it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	8	And it shall come to pass in that day , saith Jehovah of hosts , I will break his yoke from off thy neck , and will burst thy bonds , and strangers shall no more reduce him to servitude .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	9	But they shall serve Jehovah their God , and David their king , whom I will raise up unto them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	10	And thou , my servant Jacob , fear not , saith Jehovah ; neither be dismayed , O Israel : for behold , I will save thee from afar , and thy seed from the land of their captivity ; and Jacob shall return , and shall be in rest , and at ease , and none shall make [ him ] afraid .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	11	For I am with thee , saith Jehovah , to save thee : for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee ; yet of thee will I not make a full end , but I will correct thee with judgment , and will not hold thee altogether guiltless .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	12	For thus saith Jehovah : Thy bruise is incurable , thy wound is grievous .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	13	There is none to plead thy cause , to bind up [ thy wound ] ; thou hast no healing medicines .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	14	All thy lovers have forgotten thee ; they seek thee not . For I have smitten thee with the stroke of an enemy , with the chastisement of a cruel one , for the greatness of thine iniquity : thy sins are manifold .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	15	Why criest thou because of thy bruise ? thy sorrow is incurable ; for the greatness of thine iniquity , [ because ] thy sins are manifold , I have done these things unto thee .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	16	Therefore all that devour thee shall be devoured , and all thine adversaries , every one of them , shall go into captivity ; and they that spoil thee shall be for a spoil ; and all they that prey upon thee will I give to be a prey .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	17	For I will apply a bandage unto thee , and I will heal thee of thy wounds , saith Jehovah ; for they have called thee an outcast : This is Zion that no man seeketh after .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	18	Thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I will turn the captivity of Jacob 's tents , and have mercy on his habitations ; and the city shall be built upon her own heap ; and the palace shall be inhabited after the manner thereof .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	19	And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving , and the voice of them that make merry : and I will multiply them , and they shall not be diminished ; and I will honour them , and they shall not be small .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	20	And their sons shall be as aforetime ; and their assembly shall be established before me ; and I will punish all that oppress them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	21	And their prince shall be of themselves , and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them ; and I will cause him to approach , and he shall draw near unto me . For who is this that engageth his heart to draw near unto me ? saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	22	And ye shall be my people , and I will be your God .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	23	Behold , a tempest of Jehovah , fury is gone forth , a sweeping storm : it shall whirl down upon the head of the wicked .
DARBY	Jeremiah	30	24	The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not return , until he have executed , and until he have performed the purposes of his heart . At the end of the days ye shall consider it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	31	Behold , days come , saith Jehovah , that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah :
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	2	Thus saith Jehovah : The people [ that were ] left of the sword have found grace in the wilderness , [ even ] Israel , when I go to give him rest .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	3	Jehovah hath appeared from afar unto me , [ saying , ] Yea , I have loved thee with an everlasting love ; therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	4	I will build thee again , and thou shalt be built , O virgin of Israel ! Thou shalt again be adorned with thy tambours , and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	5	Thou shalt again plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria ; the planters shall plant , and shall eat the fruit .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	6	For there shall be a day , when the watchmen upon mount Ephraim shall cry , Arise , and let us go up to Zion , unto Jehovah our God .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	7	For thus saith Jehovah : Sing aloud [ with ] gladness for Jacob , and shout at the head of the nations ; publish ye , praise ye , and say , Jehovah , save thy people , the remnant of Israel .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	8	Behold , I bring them from the north country , and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth ; [ and ] among them the blind and the lame , the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together : a great assemblage shall they return hither .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	9	They shall come with weeping , and with supplications will I lead them ; I will cause them to walk by water-brooks , in a straight way , wherein they shall not stumble ; for I will be a father to Israel , and Ephraim is my firstborn .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	10	Hear the word of Jehovah , ye nations , and declare [ it ] to the isles afar off , and say , He that scattered Israel will gather him , and keep him , as a shepherd his flock .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	11	For Jehovah hath ransomed Jacob , and redeemed him from the hand of one stronger than he .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	12	And they shall come and sing aloud upon the height of Zion , and shall flow together to the goodness of Jehovah , for corn , and for new wine , and for oil , and for the young of the flock and of the herd ; and their soul shall be as a watered garden , and they shall not languish any more at all .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	13	Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , and the young men and old together ; for I will turn their mourning into gladness , and will comfort them , and make them rejoice after their sorrow .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	14	And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness , and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	15	Thus saith Jehovah : A voice hath been heard in Ramah , the wail of very bitter weeping , —Rachel weeping for her children , refusing to be comforted for her children , because they are not .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	16	Thus saith Jehovah : Refrain thy voice from weeping , and thine eyes from tears ; for there is a reward for thy work , saith Jehovah ; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	17	And there is hope for thy latter end , saith Jehovah , and thy children shall come again to their own border .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	18	I have indeed heard Ephraim bemoaning himself [ thus ] : Thou hast chastised me , and I was chastised as a bullock not trained : turn thou me , and I shall be turned ; for thou art Jehovah my God .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	19	Surely after that I was turned , I repented ; and after I knew myself , I smote upon [ my ] thigh . I was ashamed , yea , even confounded , for I bear the reproach of my youth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	20	Is Ephraim a dear son unto me ? is he a child of delights ? For whilst I have been speaking against him , I do constantly remember him still . Therefore my bowels are troubled for him : I will certainly have mercy upon him , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	21	Set up waymarks , make for thyself signposts ; set thy heart toward the highway , the way by which thou wentest : turn again , O virgin of Israel , turn again to these thy cities .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	22	How long wilt thou wander about , thou backsliding daughter ? For Jehovah hath created a new thing on the earth , a woman shall encompass a man .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	23	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : They shall again use this speech , in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof , when I shall turn their captivity : Jehovah bless thee , O habitation of righteousness , mountain of holiness !
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	24	And therein shall dwell Judah , and all the cities thereof together , the husbandmen , and they that go about with flocks .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	25	For I have satiated the weary soul , and every languishing soul have I replenished .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	26	—Upon this I awaked , and beheld ; and my sleep was sweet unto me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	27	Behold , days come , saith Jehovah , that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah [ with ] the seed of man and the seed of beast .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	28	And it shall come to pass , as I have watched over them , to pluck up , and to break down , and to overthrow , and to destroy , and to afflict ; so will I watch over them to build , and to plant , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	29	In those days they shall say no more , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge :
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	30	for every one shall die for his own iniquity ; every man that eateth the sour grapes , his teeth shall be set on edge .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	32	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers , in the day of my taking them by the hand , to lead them out of the land of Egypt ; which my covenant they broke , although I was a husband unto them , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	33	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel , after those days , saith Jehovah : I will put my law in their inward parts , and will write it in their heart ; and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	34	And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know Jehovah ; for they shall all know me , from the least of them unto the greatest of them , saith Jehovah : for I will pardon their iniquity , and their sin will I remember no more .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	35	Thus saith Jehovah , who giveth the sun for light by day , the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for light by night , who stirreth up the sea so that the waves thereof roar , —Jehovah of hosts is his name :
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	36	If those ordinances depart from before me , saith Jehovah , the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	37	Thus saith Jehovah : If the heavens above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , I will also cast off the whole seed of Israel , for all that they have done , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	38	Behold , the days come , saith Jehovah , that the city shall be built to Jehovah , from the tower of Hananeel unto the corner-gate .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	39	And the measuring line shall yet go forth before it unto the hill Gareb , and shall turn toward Goath .
DARBY	Jeremiah	31	40	And the whole valley of the dead bodies , and of the ashes , and all the fields unto the torrent Kidron , unto the corner of the horse-gate toward the east , shall be holy unto Jehovah : it shall not be plucked up , nor overthrown any more for ever .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	32	because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah , which they have done to provoke me to anger , they , their kings , their princes , their priests , and their prophets , and the men of Judah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	2	And the king of Babylon 's army was then besieging Jerusalem ; and the prophet Jeremiah was shut up in the court of the guard , which was in the king of Judah 's house .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	3	For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up , saying , Why dost thou prophesy and say , Thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall take it ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	4	and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans ; for he shall certainly be given into the hand of the king of Babylon , and shall speak with him mouth to mouth , and his eyes shall behold his eyes ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	5	and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon , and there shall he be until I visit him , saith Jehovah : though ye fight with the Chaldeans , ye shall not prosper ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	6	And Jeremiah said , The word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	7	Behold , Hanameel , the son of Shallum thine uncle , shall come unto thee , saying , Buy for thyself my field which is in Anathoth ; for thine is the right of redemption , to buy [ it ] .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	8	And Hanameel , mine uncle 's son , came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of Jehovah , and said unto me , Buy my field , I pray thee , that is in Anathoth , which is in the land of Benjamin ; for the right of inheritance is thine , and the redemption is thine : buy [ it ] for thyself . Then I knew that this was the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	9	And I bought of Hanameel , mine uncle 's son , the field which is in Anathoth , and weighed him the money , seventeen shekels of silver .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	10	And I subscribed the writing , and sealed it , and took witnesses , and weighed the money in the balances .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	11	And I took the writing of the purchase , that which was sealed [ according to ] the law and the statutes , and that which was open ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	12	and I gave the writing of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Nerijah , the son of Maaseiah , in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle 's [ son ] , and in the presence of the witnesses that had subscribed the writing of purchase , before all the Jews that were sitting in the court of the guard .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	13	And I charged Baruch in their presence , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	14	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Take these writings , this writing of the purchase , both that which is sealed and this writing which is open ; and put them in an earthen vessel , that they may remain many days .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	15	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be purchased in this land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	16	And after I had given the writing of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Nerijah , I prayed unto Jehovah saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	17	Alas , Lord Jehovah ! Behold , thou hast made the heavens and the earth by thy great power and stretched-out arm ; there is nothing too hard for thee :
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	18	who shewest mercy unto thousands , and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them , thou , the great , the mighty God , —Jehovah of hosts is his name ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	19	great in counsel and mighty in work , whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the children of men , to give every one according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his doings :
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	20	who hast displayed signs and wonders unto this day , in the land of Egypt and in Israel and among [ other ] men ; and hast made thee a name , as at this day .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	21	And thou broughtest forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt by signs , and by wonders , and by a powerful hand , and by a stretched-out arm , and by great terror ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	22	and didst give them this land , which thou hadst sworn unto their fathers to give them , a land flowing with milk and honey .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	23	And they came in and possessed it : but they hearkened not unto thy voice , neither walked in thy law ; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do ; so that thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	24	Behold the mounds , they are come unto the city for taking it ; and the city is given over into the hand of the Chaldeans , that fight against it , by the sword , and the famine , and the pestilence : and what thou hast spoken is come to pass ; and behold , thou seest [ it ] .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	25	And thou , Lord Jehovah , thou hast said unto me , Buy for thyself the field for money , and take witnesses ; —and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	26	And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	27	Behold , I am Jehovah , the God of all flesh : is there anything too hard for me ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	28	Therefore thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans , and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon , and he shall take it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	29	And the Chaldeans , that fight against this city , shall come in and set fire to this city , and shall burn it , and the houses upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal , and poured out drink-offerings unto other gods , to provoke me to anger .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	30	For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have been doing only evil in my sight from their youth ; for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	31	For this city hath been to me [ a provocation ] of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	33	And they have turned unto me the back , and not the face ; and though I taught them , rising early and teaching , they hearkened not to receive instruction .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	34	And they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name , to defile it ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	35	and they have built the high places of Baal , which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom , to cause to pass through [ the fire ] their sons and their daughters unto Molech : which I commanded them not , neither came it into my mind , that they should do this abomination , to cause Judah to sin .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	36	And now therefore Jehovah , the God of Israel , saith thus concerning this city , whereof ye say , It hath been given over into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence :
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	37	Behold , I will gather them out of all the countries whither I have driven them , in mine anger , and in my fury , and in great wrath ; and I will bring them again unto this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	38	And they shall be my people , and I will be their God .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	39	And I will give them one heart , and one way , that they may fear me all [ their ] days , for the good of them , and of their children after them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	40	And I will make an everlasting covenant with them , that I will not draw back from them , to do them good ; and I will put my fear in their heart , that they may not turn aside from me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	41	And I will rejoice over them to do them good , and I will assuredly plant them in this land with my whole heart and with my whole soul .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	42	For thus saith Jehovah : Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people , so will I bring upon them all the good that I have spoken concerning them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	43	And fields shall be bought in this land , whereof ye say , It is desolate without man or beast ; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans .
DARBY	Jeremiah	32	44	[ Men ] shall buy fields for money , and subscribe the writings , and seal them , and take witnesses , in the land of Benjamin , and in the environs of Jerusalem , and in the cities of Judah , and in the cities of the hill-country , and in the cities of the lowland , and in the cities of the south : for I will turn their captivity , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	33	And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the second time , while he was still shut up in the court of the prison , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	2	Thus saith Jehovah the doer of it , Jehovah that formeth it to establish it , Jehovah is his name :
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	3	Call unto me , and I will answer thee , and I will shew thee great and hidden things , which thou knowest not .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	4	For thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel concerning the houses of this city , and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah , which are thrown down because of the mounds and because of the sword :
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	5	They come to fight with the Chaldeans , but to fill them with the dead bodies of the men whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury , and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	6	Behold , I will apply a healing dressing to it and cure , and I will heal them , and will reveal unto them an abundance of peace and truth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	7	And I will turn the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel , and will build them , as at the beginning .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	8	And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity , whereby they have sinned against me , and I will pardon all their iniquities , whereby they have sinned against me , and whereby they have transgressed against me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	9	And it shall be to me a name of joy , a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth , which shall hear of all the good that I do unto them ; and they shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the prosperity that I procure unto it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	10	Thus saith Jehovah : In this place of which ye say , It is waste , without man and without beast ! in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate , without man , and without inhabitant , and without beast ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	11	there shall again be heard the voice of mirth and the voice of joy , the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride , the voice of them that say , Give ye thanks unto Jehovah of hosts ; for Jehovah is good , for his loving-kindness [ endureth ] for ever , —of them that bring thanksgiving unto the house of Jehovah . For I will turn the captivity of the land as in the beginning , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	12	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : In this place which is waste , without man and without beast , and in all the cities thereof , there shall again be a habitation of shepherds causing [ their ] flocks to lie down .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	13	In the cities of the hill-country , in the cities of the lowland , and in the cities of the south , and in the land of Benjamin , and in the environs of Jerusalem , and in the cities of Judah , shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that counteth [ them ] , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	14	Behold , the days come , saith Jehovah , that I will perform the good word which I have spoken unto the house of Israel and unto the house of Judah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	15	In those days , and at that time , will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David ; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	16	In those days shall Judah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety . And this is the name wherewith she shall be called : Jehovah our Righteousness .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	17	For thus saith Jehovah : There shall never fail to David a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	18	neither shall there fail to the priests the Levites a man before me to offer up burnt-offerings , and to burn oblations , and to do sacrifice continually .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	19	And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	20	Thus saith Jehovah : If ye can break my covenant [ in respect ] of the day , and my covenant [ in respect ] of the night , so that there should not be day and night in their season ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	21	[ then ] shall also my covenant be broken with David my servant , that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne ; and with the Levites , the priests , my ministers .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	22	As the host of the heavens can not be numbered , nor the sand of the sea measured , so will I multiply the seed of David my servant , and the Levites that minister unto me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	23	And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	24	Hast thou not seen what this people have spoken , saying , The two families that Jehovah had chosen , he hath even cast them off ? And they despise my people , that they should be no more a nation before them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	25	Thus saith Jehovah : If my covenant of day and night [ stand ] not , if I have not appointed the ordinances of the heavens and the earth ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	33	26	[ then ] will I also cast away the seed of Jacob , and of David my servant , so as not to take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob : for I will turn their captivity , and will have mercy on them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	34	The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah , when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , and all his army , and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion , and all the peoples , fought against Jerusalem and against all the cities thereof , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	2	Thus saith Jehovah , the God of Israel : Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah , and tell him , Thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire .
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	3	And thou shalt not escape out of his hand , but shalt certainly be taken , and given into his hand ; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon , and his mouth shall speak with thy mouth , and thou shalt go to Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	4	Only , hear the word of Jehovah , O Zedekiah king of Judah . Thus saith Jehovah as to thee : Thou shalt not die by the sword ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	5	thou shalt die in peace , and with the burnings of thy fathers , the former kings that were before thee , so shall they burn for thee ; and they will lament for thee , Ah , lord ! for I have spoken the word , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	6	And the prophet Jeremiah spoke all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah , in Jerusalem .
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	7	And the king of Babylon 's army fought against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of Judah that were left , against Lachish , and against Azekah ; for these were amongst the cities of Judah , the fenced cities that were left .
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	8	The word that came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah , after that king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people that were at Jerusalem , to proclaim liberty unto them :
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	9	that every man should let his bondman , and every man his bondmaid , the Hebrew and the Hebrewess , go free , that none should exact service of them , [ that is , ] of a Jew his brother .
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	10	And all the princes and all the people that had entered into the covenant obeyed , every man letting his bondman and every man his bondmaid go free , that none should exact service of them any more : they obeyed , and let [ them ] go .
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	11	But afterwards they turned , and caused the bondmen and the bondmaids whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subjection for bondmen and for bondmaids .
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	12	And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah from Jehovah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	13	Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel : I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bondage , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	14	At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother , a Hebrew , who hath sold himself unto thee ; when he hath served thee six years , thou shalt let him go free from thee . But your fathers hearkened not unto me , neither inclined their ear .
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	15	And you , ye had this day turned , and had done right in my sight , in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour ; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name :
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	16	but ye have turned and profaned my name , and caused every man his bondman , and every man his bondmaid , whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure , to return , and ye have brought them into subjection , to be unto you for bondmen and for bondmaids .
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	17	Therefore thus saith Jehovah : Ye have not hearkened unto me , in proclaiming liberty , every man to his brother , and every man to his neighbour : behold , I proclaim a liberty for you , saith Jehovah , to the sword , to the pestilence , and to the famine ; and I will give you over to be driven hither and thither among all the kingdoms of the earth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	18	And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant , who have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me , —the calf which they cut in twain , and passed between the parts thereof ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	19	—the princes of Judah and the princes of Jerusalem , the eunuchs , and the priests , and all the people of the land , that passed between the parts of the calf ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	20	them will I give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life ; and their carcases shall be food for the fowl of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	21	And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , which are gone up from you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	34	22	Behold , I command , saith Jehovah , and I will cause them to return to this city ; and they shall fight against it , and take it , and burn it with fire ; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation , without inhabitant .
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	35	The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , the king of Judah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	2	Go to the house of the Rechabites , and speak with them , and bring them into the house of Jehovah , into one of the chambers , and give them wine to drink .
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	3	And I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah , the son of Habazziniah , and his brethren , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rechabites ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	4	and I brought them into the house of Jehovah , into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah , the man of God , which was by the chamber of the princes , which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum , the keeper of the threshold .
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	5	And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine , and cups , and I said unto them , Drink wine .
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	6	And they said , We will drink no wine ; for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us , saying , Ye shall drink no wine , ye nor your sons for ever ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	7	neither shall ye build house , nor sow seed , nor plant vineyard , nor shall ye have [ any ] ; but all your days ye shall dwell in tents , that ye may live many days in the land where ye sojourn .
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	8	And we have hearkened unto the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he commanded us , to drink no wine all our days , we , our wives , our sons , and our daughters ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	9	and not to build houses for us to dwell in ; neither have we vineyard , nor field , nor seed ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	10	but we have dwelt in tents , and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us .
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	11	And it came to pass when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , Come and let us go into Jerusalem because of the army of the Chaldeans , and because of the army of Syria ; and we dwell at Jerusalem .
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	12	And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	13	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Go and say to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , Will ye not receive instruction to hearken unto my words ? saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	14	The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab , that he commanded his sons not to drink wine , are performed ; and to this day they have drunk none , for they have obeyed their father 's commandment . But I have spoken unto you , rising early and speaking , and ye have not hearkened unto me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	15	And I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets , rising early and sending , saying , Return ye now every man from his evil way , and amend your doings , and go not after other gods to serve them ; and ye shall dwell in the land that I have given to you and to your fathers : but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened unto me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	16	Yea , the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them , but this people hath not hearkened unto me ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	17	therefore thus saith Jehovah the God of hosts , the God of Israel : Behold , I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them , because I have spoken unto them , but they have not hearkened , and I have called unto them , but they have not answered .
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	18	And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites , Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father , and kept all his injunctions , and have done according unto all that he hath commanded you ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	35	19	therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel , There shall not fail to Jonadab the son of Rechab a man to stand before me , for ever .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	36	And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , the king of Judah , [ that ] this word came to Jeremiah from Jehovah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	2	Take thee a roll of a book , and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel , and against Judah , and against all the nations , from the day I spoke unto thee , from the days of Josiah , even unto this day .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	3	It may be the house of Judah will hear all the evil that I purpose to do unto them , that they may return every man from his evil way , and that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	4	And Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Nerijah ; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah , which he had spoken unto him , upon a roll of a book .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	5	And Jeremiah commanded Baruch , saying , I am shut up , I can not go into the house of Jehovah ; but go thou in ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	6	and read in the roll , which thou hast written from my mouth , the words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in the house of Jehovah upon the fast day ; and thou shalt also read them in the ears of all Judah that come from their cities .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	7	It may be they will present their supplication before Jehovah , and that they will return every one from his evil way ; for great is the anger and the fury that Jehovah hath pronounced against this people .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	8	And Baruch the son of Nerijah did according to all that the prophet Jeremiah commanded him , reading in the book the words of Jehovah in Jehovah 's house .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	9	And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , the king of Judah , in the ninth month , [ that ] they proclaimed a fast before Jehovah , for all the people in Jerusalem , and for all the people that came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	10	And Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah , in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe , in the upper court , at the entry of the new gate of the house of Jehovah , in the ears of all the people .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	11	And Micah the son of Gemariah the son of Shaphan heard out of the book all the words of Jehovah ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	12	and he went down to the king 's house , into the scribe 's chamber , and behold , all the princes were sitting there : Elishama the scribe , and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah , and Elnathan the son of Achbor , and Gemariah the son of Shaphan , and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah , and all the princes .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	13	And Micah declared unto them all the words that he had heard , when Baruch read in the book in the ears of the people .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	14	And all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Cushi , unto Baruch , saying , Take in thy hand the roll in which thou hast read in the ears of the people , and come . And Baruch the son of Nerijah took the roll in his hand , and came unto them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	15	And they said unto him , Sit down now , and read it in our ears . And Baruch read [ it ] in their ears .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	16	And it came to pass , when they heard all the words , they turned in fear one toward another , and said unto Baruch , We will certainly report to the king all these words .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	17	And they asked Baruch , saying , Tell us now , How didst thou write all these words from his mouth ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	18	And Baruch said unto them , He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth , and I wrote [ them ] with ink in the book .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	19	And the princes said unto Baruch , Go , hide thee , thou and Jeremiah ; that none may know where ye are .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	20	And they went in unto the king into the court , but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe ; and they told all the words in the ears of the king .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	21	And the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll , and he fetched it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe . And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes that stood beside the king .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	22	Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month , and with the fire-pan burning before him .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	23	And it came to pass , that when Jehudi had read three or four columns , he cut it with the scribe 's knife , and cast it into the fire that was in the pan until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was in the pan .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	24	And they were not afraid , nor rent their garments , [ neither ] the king nor any of his servants that heard all these words .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	25	Moreover , Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll ; but he would not hear them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	26	And the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech , and Seraiah the son of Azriel , and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel , to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet ; but Jehovah hid them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	27	And after that the king had burned the roll , and the words that Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah , the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	28	Take thee again another roll , and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	29	And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah , Thus saith Jehovah : Thou hast burned this roll , saying , Why hast thou written therein , saying , The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land , and shall cause to cease from it man and beast ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	30	Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah : He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David ; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the frost .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	31	And I will visit their iniquity upon him , and upon his seed , and upon his servants ; and I will bring upon them , and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and upon the men of Judah , all the evil that I have pronounced against them ; and they have not hearkened .
DARBY	Jeremiah	36	32	And Jeremiah took another roll , and gave it to Baruch the scribe , the son of Nerijah ; and he wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah , all the words of the book that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire ; and there were added besides unto them many like words .
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	37	And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim , Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon having made him king in the land of Judah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	2	And neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , hearkened unto the words of Jehovah , which he had spoken through the prophet Jeremiah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	3	And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah , and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah , saying , Pray now unto Jehovah our God for us .
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	4	And Jeremiah came in and went out among the people ; for they had not put him into prison .
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	5	And Pharaoh 's army was come forth out of Egypt ; and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them , they went up from Jerusalem .
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	6	And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah the prophet , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	7	Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel : Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah , that sent you unto me to inquire of me : Behold , Pharaoh 's army , which is come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	8	And the Chaldeans shall come again , and fight against this city , and take it , and burn it with fire .
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	9	Thus saith Jehovah : Deceive not yourselves , saying , The Chaldeans are certainly gone away from us ; for they are not gone .
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	10	For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you , and there remained [ but ] wounded men among them , [ yet ] should they rise up every man in his tent , and burn this city with fire .
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	11	And it came to pass when the army of the Chaldeans was gone up from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh 's army ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	12	that Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin , to have his portion there among the people .
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	13	And when he was in the gate of Benjamin , a captain of the guard was there whose name was Irijah , the son of Shelemiah , the son of Hananiah ; and he laid hold on the prophet Jeremiah , saying , Thou art deserting to the Chaldeans .
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	14	And Jeremiah said , It is false : I am not deserting to the Chaldeans . But he hearkened not to him ; and Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah , and brought him to the princes .
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	15	And the princes were wroth with Jeremiah , and smote him , and put him in the place of confinement in the house of Jonathan the scribe : for they had made that the prison .
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	16	When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon and into the vaults , and Jeremiah had remained there many days ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	17	king Zedekiah sent and took him out . And the king asked of him secretly in his house , and said , Is there any word from Jehovah ? And Jeremiah said , There is ; and he said , Thou shalt be given into the hand of the king of Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	18	And Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah , What have I offended against thee , or against thy servants , or against this people , that ye have put me in the prison ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	19	And where are your prophets that prophesied unto you , saying , The king of Babylon shall not come against you , nor against this land ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	20	And now hear , I pray thee , my lord , O king : let my supplication , I pray thee , come before thee ; and cause me not to return into the house of Jonathan the scribe , lest I die there .
DARBY	Jeremiah	37	21	Then Zedekiah the king commanded , and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard , and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers ' street , until all the bread in the city was spent . And Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	38	And Shephatiah the son of Mattan , and Gedaliah the son of Pashur , and Jucal the son of Shelemiah , and Pashur the son of Malchijah , heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	2	Thus saith Jehovah : He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ; but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live ; and he shall have his life for a prey , and shall live .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	3	Thus saith Jehovah : This city shall certainly be given into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , and he shall take it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	4	And the princes said unto the king , Let this man , we pray thee , be put to death ; for why should he weaken the hands of the men of war that remain in this city , and the hands of all the people , in speaking to them according to these words ? for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people , but the hurt .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	5	And king Zedekiah said , Behold , he is in your hand ; for the king is not he that can do a thing against you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	6	Then they took Jeremiah , and cast him into the dungeon of Malchijah the son of Hammelech , which was in the court of the guard , and they let down Jeremiah with cords . And in the dungeon there was no water , but mire ; and Jeremiah sank in the mire .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	7	And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian , a eunuch who was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon—now the king was sitting in the gate of Benjamin ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	8	—and Ebed-melech went forth out of the king 's house , and spoke to the king , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	9	My lord , O king , these men have done evil in all that they have done to the prophet Jeremiah , whom they have cast into the dungeon ; and he will die by reason of the famine in the place where he is ; for there is no more bread in the city .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	10	And the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian , saying , Take from hence thirty men with thee , and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon , before he die .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	11	And Ebed-melech took the men under his order , and went into the house of the king under the treasury , and took thence old shreds and worn-out clothes , and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	12	And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah , Put , I pray , [ these ] old shreds and rags under thine armholes under the cords . And Jeremiah did so .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	13	And they drew up Jeremiah with cords , and brought him up out of the dungeon ; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	14	And king Zedekiah sent and took the prophet Jeremiah unto him , into the third entry that is in the house of Jehovah ; and the king said unto Jeremiah , I will ask thee a thing : hide nothing from me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	15	And Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah , If I declare [ it ] unto thee , wilt thou not certainly put me to death ? and if I give thee counsel , thou wilt not hearken unto me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	16	And king Zedekiah swore secretly unto Jeremiah , saying , [ As ] Jehovah liveth , that made us this soul , I will not put thee to death , neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	17	And Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah , Thus saith Jehovah the God of hosts , the God of Israel : If thou wilt freely go forth to the king of Babylon 's princes , then thy soul shall live , and this city shall not be burned with fire ; and thou shalt live , and thy house .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	18	But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon 's princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans , and they shall burn it with fire , and thou shalt not escape out of their hand .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	19	And king Zedekiah said unto Jeremiah , I am afraid of the Jews that have deserted to the Chaldeans , lest they give me over into their hand , and they mock me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	20	And Jeremiah said , They shall not give [ thee ] over . Hearken , I beseech thee , unto the voice of Jehovah , in that which I speak unto thee ; so shall it be well unto thee , and thy soul shall live .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	21	But if thou refuse to go forth , this is the word which Jehovah hath shewn me :
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	22	Behold , all the women that are left in the king of Judah 's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon 's princes ; and they shall say , Thy familiar friends have set thee on , and have prevailed over thee ; thy feet are sunk in the mire , they are turned away back .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	23	And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans , and thou shalt not escape out of their hand ; for thou shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon , and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	24	And Zedekiah said unto Jeremiah , Let no man know of these words , and thou shalt not die .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	25	And if the princes hear that I have talked with thee , and they come unto thee , and say unto thee , Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king , hide it not from us , and we will not put thee to death ; and what hath the king said unto thee ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	26	then thou shalt say unto them , I presented my supplication before the king , that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan 's house , to die there .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	27	—And all the princes came to Jeremiah , and asked him ; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded . And they withdrew quietly from him ; for the matter was not reported .
DARBY	Jeremiah	38	28	And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken .
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	39	And it came to pass when Jerusalem was taken , in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the tenth month , came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem , and they besieged it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	2	In the eleventh year of Zedekiah , in the fourth month , on the ninth of the month , the city was broken into ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	3	and all the princes of the king of Babylon came in , and sat in the middle gate : Nergal-sharezer , Samgar-nebu , Sarsechim , chief chamberlain , Nergal-sharezer , chief magian , and all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	4	And it came to pass when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them , that they fled , and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the king 's garden , by the gate between the two walls ; and he went out the way of the plain .
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	5	And the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho ; and they took him , and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon , unto Riblah in the land of Hamath ; and he pronounced judgment upon him .
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	6	And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes , and the king of Babylon slaughtered all the nobles of Judah ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	7	and he put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him with chains of brass , to carry him to Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	8	And the Chaldeans burned the king 's house and the houses of the people with fire , and broke down the walls of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	9	And Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard carried away captive into Babylon the rest of the people that were left in the city , and the deserters that had deserted to him , with the rest of the people that were left .
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	10	But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard left [ certain ] of the people , the poor who had nothing , in the land of Judah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	11	And Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had given charge concerning Jeremiah by Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	12	Take him , and keep an eye upon him , and do him no harm ; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee .
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	13	So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard sent , and Nebushazban , chief chamberlain , and Nergal-sharezer , chief magian , and all the king of Babylon 's princes ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	14	even they sent , and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan , that he should conduct him away home . And he dwelt among the people .
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	15	And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah , while he was shut up in the court of the guard , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	16	Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian , saying , Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Behold , I will bring my words upon this city for evil , and not for good , and they shall come to pass before thy face in that day .
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	17	And I will deliver thee in that day , saith Jehovah ; and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	39	18	for I will certainly save thee , and thou shalt not fall by the sword , but thou shalt have thy life for a prey ; for thou hast put thy confidence in me , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	40	40	The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah , after that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard had let him go from Ramah , when he had taken him , being bound in chains , among all the captivity of Jerusalem and Judah , that were carried away captive to Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	40	2	And the captain of the body-guard took Jeremiah , and said unto him , Jehovah thy God pronounced this evil upon this place ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	40	3	and Jehovah hath brought [ it about ] and done according as he said ; for ye have sinned against Jehovah , and have not hearkened unto his voice , therefore this thing is come upon you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	40	4	And now , behold , I loose thee this day from the chains that are upon thy hand . If it seem good in thy sight to come with me to Babylon , come , and I will keep mine eye upon thee ; but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me to Babylon , forbear . See , all the land is before thee : whither it seemeth good and right in thy sight to go , thither go .
DARBY	Jeremiah	40	5	And while he had not yet given answer ; [ he said , ] Yea , go back to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan , whom the king of Babylon hath appointed over the cities of Judah , and abide with him in the midst of the people ; or go wheresoever it seemeth right in thy sight to go . And the captain of the body-guard gave him provisions and a present , and let him go .
DARBY	Jeremiah	40	6	And Jeremiah came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah , and abode with him among the people that remained in the land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	40	7	And all the captains of the forces that were in the fields , they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam over the land , and had committed unto him men , and women , and children , and of the poor of the land , of them that had not been carried away captive to Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	40	8	And they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah ; even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth , and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite , and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite , they and their men .
DARBY	Jeremiah	40	9	And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore unto them and to their men , saying , Fear not to serve the Chaldeans : dwell in the land , and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	40	10	And as for me , behold , I dwell at Mizpah , to stand before the Chaldeans , who will come unto us ; and ye , gather wine , and summer fruits , and oil , and put [ them ] in your vessels , and dwell in your cities which ye have taken .
DARBY	Jeremiah	40	11	Likewise all the Jews that were in Moab , and among the children of Ammon and in Edom , and that were in all the lands , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah , and that he had appointed over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	40	12	and all the Jews returned out of all the places whither they had been driven , and came to the land of Judah to Gedaliah , unto Mizpah , and gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance .
DARBY	Jeremiah	40	13	And Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields , came to Gedaliah unto Mizpah ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	40	14	and said unto him , Dost thou indeed know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to smite thee to death ? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not .
DARBY	Jeremiah	40	15	And Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly , saying , Let me go , I pray thee , and I will smite Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and no man shall know it : why should he take thy life , and all they of Judah who are gathered unto thee be scattered , and the remnant of Judah perish ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	40	16	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah , Thou shalt not do this thing ; for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael .
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	41	And it came to pass in the seventh month , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama , of the royal seed , and [ one ] of the king 's chief men , and ten men with him , came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam unto Mizpah , and there they ate bread together , in Mizpah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	2	And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose , and the ten men that were with him , and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword , and killed him , whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	3	And Ishmael smote all the Jews that were with him , with Gedaliah , at Mizpah , and the Chaldeans that were found there , the men of war .
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	4	And it came to pass the second day after he had killed Gedaliah , and no man knew it ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	5	that there came men from Shechem , from Shiloh , and from Samaria , eighty men , having their beards shaven and their clothes rent , and having cut themselves ; with oblations and incense in their hand , to bring them to the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	6	And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them , weeping all along as he went ; and it came to pass when he met them , he said unto them , Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam .
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	7	And it was so , when they came into the midst of the city , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , he and the men that were with him , slew them , [ and cast them ] into the midst of the pit .
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	8	But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael , Do not kill us , for we have hidden stores in the field , of wheat , and of barley , and of oil , and of honey . So he forbore , and did not kill them among their brethren .
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	9	And the pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain by the side of Gedaliah was the one which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel : Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain .
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	10	And Ishmael carried away captive all the remnant of the people that were in Mizpah , the king 's daughters , and all the people that remained in Mizpah , whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam : Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive , and departed to go over to the children of Ammon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	11	And Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	12	and they took all the men , and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and found him by the great waters that are at Gibeon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	13	And it came to pass when all the people that were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , then they were glad .
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	14	And all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back , and went to Johanan the son of Kareah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	15	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men , and went to the children of Ammon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	16	Then Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , from Mizpah , after he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , the mighty men of war , and the women , and the children , and the eunuchs , whom he had brought again from Gibeon ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	17	and they departed , and dwelt at Geruth-Chimham , which is by Bethlehem , to go to enter into Egypt ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	41	18	because of the Chaldeans ; for they feared them , because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had smitten Gedaliah the son of Ahikam , whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	42	And all the captains of the forces , and Johanan the son of Kareah , and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	2	came near and said unto Jeremiah the prophet , Let , we beseech thee , our supplication come before thee , and pray for us unto Jehovah thy God , for all this remnant ( for we are left a few of many , as thine eyes do behold us ) ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	3	that Jehovah thy God may shew us the way wherein we should walk , and the thing that we should do .
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	4	And Jeremiah the prophet said unto them , I have heard ; behold , I will pray unto Jehovah your God according to your words ; and it shall come to pass [ that ] whatsoever thing Jehovah shall answer you , I will declare it unto you : I will keep nothing back from you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	5	And they said to Jeremiah , Jehovah be a true and faithful witness amongst us , if we do not even according to all the word for which Jehovah thy God shall send thee to us .
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	6	Whether it be good or whether it be evil , we will hearken unto the voice of Jehovah our God , to whom we send thee ; that it may be well with us when we hearken unto the voice of Jehovah our God .
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	7	And it came to pass at the end of ten days , that the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	8	And he called Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were with him , and all the people from the least even unto the greatest ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	9	and said unto them , Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel , to whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him :
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	10	If ye will still abide in this land , then will I build you , and not overthrow [ you ] , and I will plant you , and not pluck [ you ] up ; for I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	11	Be not afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom ye are afraid : be not afraid of him , saith Jehovah ; for I will be with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	12	And I will grant mercies to you , that he may have mercy upon you , and cause you to return to your own land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	13	But if ye say , We will not dwell in this land ; so as not to hearken unto the voice of Jehovah your God ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	14	saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger for bread ; and there will we dwell ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	15	—and now , therefore , hear the word of Jehovah , ye remnant of Judah : thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : If ye really set your faces to enter into Egypt , and go to sojourn there ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	16	then it shall come to pass , that the sword which ye fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt , and the famine , whereof ye are afraid , shall follow hard after you there in Egypt ; and there ye shall die .
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	17	And it shall be that all the men that have set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	18	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : As mine anger and my fury have been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so shall my fury be poured forth upon you , when ye shall enter into Egypt ; and ye shall be an execration , and an astonishment , and a curse , and a reproach , and ye shall see this place no more .
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	19	Jehovah hath said concerning you , the remnant of Judah , Go ye not into Egypt . Know certainly that I have admonished you this day .
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	20	For ye deceived yourselves in your own souls , when ye sent me unto Jehovah your God , saying , Pray for us unto Jehovah our God ; and according to all that Jehovah our God shall say , so declare unto us , and we will do it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	21	And I have this day declared [ it ] to you ; but ye have not obeyed the voice of Jehovah your God , nor anything for which he hath sent me unto you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	42	22	And now know certainly that ye shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence , in the place whither ye desire to go to sojourn .
DARBY	Jeremiah	43	43	And it came to pass , when Jeremiah had ended speaking unto all the people all the words of Jehovah their God , with which Jehovah their God had sent him to them—all these words ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	43	2	—then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah , and Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the proud men , saying to Jeremiah , Thou speakest falsely : Jehovah our God hath not sent thee to say , Go not into Egypt to sojourn there ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	43	3	but Baruch the son of Nerijah is setting thee on against us , to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans , that they may put us to death , and carry us away captives into Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	43	4	So Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people , hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah to abide in the land of Judah ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	43	5	but Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , took all the remnant of Judah , that were returned from all nations whither they had been driven , to sojourn in the land of Judah ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	43	6	men , and women , and children , and the king 's daughters , and every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan , and Jeremiah the prophet , and Baruch the son of Nerijah ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	43	7	and they came into the land of Egypt : for they hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah . And they came as far as Tahpanhes .
DARBY	Jeremiah	43	8	And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	43	9	Take great stones in thy hand , and hide them in the clay in the brick-kiln , which is at the entry of Pharaoh 's house in Tahpanhes , in the sight of the Jews ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	43	10	and say unto them , Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Behold , I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon , my servant , and will set his throne upon these stones which I have hidden , and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	43	11	And he shall come and smite the land of Egypt : such as are for death to death , and such as are for captivity to captivity ; and such as are for the sword to the sword .
DARBY	Jeremiah	43	12	And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt , and he shall burn them , and carry them away captive ; and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt , as a shepherd putteth on his garment ; and he shall go forth from thence in peace .
DARBY	Jeremiah	43	13	And he shall break the pillars of Beth-shemesh , which is in the land of Egypt ; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	44	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who dwelt in the land of Egypt , who dwelt at Migdol , and at Tahpanhes , and at Noph , and in the country of Pathros , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	2	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem , and upon all the cities of Judah ; and behold they are , this day , a waste , and no man dwelleth therein ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	3	because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger , in that they went to burn incense to serve other gods which they knew not , they , [ nor ] ye , nor your fathers .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	4	And I sent unto you all my servants the prophets , rising early and sending , saying , Oh , do not this abominable thing which I hate !
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	5	But they hearkened not , nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness , to burn no incense unto other gods .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	6	And my fury and mine anger was poured forth , and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; and they are become a waste , a desolation , as at this day .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	7	And now thus saith Jehovah the God of hosts , the God of Israel : Wherefore commit ye great evil against your souls , to cut off from you man and woman , infant and suckling , out of the midst of Judah , to leave you no remnant ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	8	provoking me to anger with the works of your hands , burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt , whither ye are come to sojourn , that ye should be cut off , and that ye should be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	9	Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers , and the wickedness of the kings of Judah , and the wickedness of their wives , and your own wickedness , and the wickedness of your wives , which they have committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	10	They are not humbled unto this day , neither have they feared , nor walked in my law , nor in my statutes which I set before you and before your fathers .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	11	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Behold , I will set my face against you for evil , and to cut off all Judah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	12	And I will take the remnant of Judah , that have set their faces to enter into the land of Egypt to sojourn there , and they shall all be consumed : in the land of Egypt shall they fall ; they shall be consumed by the sword [ and ] by the famine , from the least even unto the greatest ; they shall die by the sword and by the famine , and they shall be an execration , an astonishment , and a curse , and a reproach .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	13	And I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt as I have punished Jerusalem , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	14	and none of the remnant of Judah , that have come into the land of Egypt to sojourn there , shall escape or remain , so as to return into the land of Judah , whither they have a desire to return to dwell there ; for none shall return but such as shall escape .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	15	Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods , and all the women who stood by , a great assemblage , even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt , in Pathros , answered Jeremiah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	16	[ As for ] the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of Jehovah , we will not hearken unto thee ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	17	but we will certainly do every word that is gone forth out of our mouth , to burn incense to the queen of the heavens , and to pour out drink-offerings to her , as we have done , we and our fathers , our kings and our princes , in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; and we had plenty of bread , and were well , and saw no evil .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	18	But since we left off burning incense to the queen of the heavens , and pouring out drink-offerings to her , we have wanted everything , and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	19	And when we burned incense to the queen of the heavens and poured out drink-offerings to her , did we make for her cakes to portray her , and pour out drink-offerings to her , without our husbands ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	20	And Jeremiah said unto all the people , to the men , and to the women , and to all the people that had given him that answer , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	21	Is it not the incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem , ye and your fathers , your kings and your princes and the people of the land , that Jehovah remembered , and that came into his mind ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	22	And Jehovah could no longer bear , because of the evil of your doings , [ and ] because of the abominations that ye had committed ; and your land is become a waste , and an astonishment , and a curse , without inhabitant , as at this day .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	23	Because ye have burned incense , and because ye have sinned against Jehovah , and have not hearkened unto the voice of Jehovah , nor walked in his law , nor in his statutes , nor in his testimonies ; therefore this evil hath come upon you , as at this day .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	24	And Jeremiah said unto all the people , and to all the women , Hear ye the word of Jehovah , all Judah that are in the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	25	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel , saying , Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths , and fulfilled with your hands , saying , We will certainly perform our vows which we have vowed , to burn incense to the queen of the heavens , and to pour out drink-offerings unto her . Ye will certainly establish your vows , and entirely perform your vows .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	26	Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah , all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt : Behold , I have sworn by my great name , saith Jehovah , that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt , saying , [ As ] the Lord Jehovah liveth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	27	Behold , I will watch over them for evil , and not for good ; and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until there be an end of them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	28	And they that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah , a very small company ; and all the remnant of Judah , that have come into the land of Egypt to sojourn there , shall know whose word shall stand , mine or theirs .
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	29	And this shall be the sign unto you , saith Jehovah , that I will punish you in this place , that ye may know that my words shall certainly stand against you for evil :
DARBY	Jeremiah	44	30	thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I will give Pharaoh-Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies , and into the hand of them that seek his life ; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , his enemy , and that sought his life .
DARBY	Jeremiah	45	45	The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Nerijah , when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah , in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , the king of Judah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	45	2	Thus sayeth Jehovah , the God of Israel , concerning thee , Baruch :
DARBY	Jeremiah	45	3	Thou didst say , Woe unto me ! for Jehovah hath added grief to my sorrow ; I am weary with my sighing , and I find no rest .
DARBY	Jeremiah	45	4	Thus shalt thou say unto him , Thus saith Jehovah : Behold , what I have built do I overthrow , and what I have planted I pluck up , even this whole land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	45	5	And seekest thou great things for thyself ? seek [ them ] not ; for behold , I will bring evil upon all flesh , saith Jehovah ; but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou shalt go .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	46	The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	2	Of Egypt : concerning the army of Pharaoh-Necho king of Egypt , which was by the river Euphrates at Carchemish , which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah , the king of Judah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	3	Make ready buckler and shield , and draw near to battle !
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	4	Harness the horses , and mount ye horsemen , and stand forth with helmets ; polish the spears , put on the coats of mail !
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	5	Why do I see them dismayed , turned away back ? And their mighty ones are beaten down , and take to flight , and look not back ? Terror [ is ] on every side , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	6	Let not the swift flee away , neither let the mighty man escape ! —Toward the north , hard by the river Euphrates , they have stumbled and fallen .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	7	Who is this [ that ] riseth up as the Nile , whose waters toss themselves like the rivers ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	8	It is Egypt that riseth up as the Nile , and [ his ] waters toss themselves like the rivers ; and he saith , I will rise up , I will cover the earth ; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	9	Go up , ye horses , and drive furiously , ye chariots ; and let the mighty men go forth : Cush and Phut that handle the shield , and the Ludim that handle the bow [ and ] bend it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	10	For this is the day of the Lord Jehovah of hosts , a day of vengeance , that he may be avenged of his adversaries ; and the sword shall devour , and it shall be sated and made drunk with their blood ; for the Lord Jehovah of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country , by the river Euphrates .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	11	Go up to Gilead , and fetch balm , O virgin-daughter of Egypt ! In vain shalt thou multiply remedies : there is no healing for thee .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	12	The nations have heard of thy shame , and thy cry hath filled the earth ; for the mighty man stumbleth against the mighty , they are both fallen together .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	13	The word that Jehovah spoke to Jeremiah the prophet , concerning the coming of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to smite the land of Egypt :
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	14	Declare in Egypt , and publish in Migdol , and publish in Noph , and in Tahpanhes ; say , Stand fast , and prepare thee ; for the sword devoureth round about thee .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	15	Why are thy valiants swept away ? They stood not , for Jehovah did thrust them down .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	16	He made many to stumble , yea , one fell upon another ; and they said , Arise , and let us return to our own people and to the land of our nativity , from the oppressing sword .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	17	There did they cry , Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise ; he hath let the time appointed go by .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	18	[ As ] I live , saith the King , whose name is Jehovah of hosts , surely as Tabor among the mountains , and as Carmel by the sea , so shall he come .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	19	Thou , inhabitress , daughter of Egypt , furnish for thyself a captive 's baggage , for Noph shall be a desolation and shall be ruined , so that none shall dwell therein .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	20	Egypt is a very fair heifer ; the gad-fly cometh , it cometh from the north .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	21	Also her hired men in the midst of her are like fatted bullocks ; for they also have turned back , they have fled away together , they did not stand ; for the day of their calamity is come upon them , the time of their visitation .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	22	Her voice shall go like a serpent 's ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with axes , as hewers of wood .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	23	They shall cut down her forest , saith Jehovah , though it be impenetrable ; for they are more than the locusts , and are innumerable .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	24	The daughter of Egypt is put to shame ; she is delivered into the hand of the people of the north .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	25	Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel , saith , Behold , I will punish Amon of No , and Pharaoh , and Egypt , and her gods , and her kings ; yea , Pharaoh and them that confide in him .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	26	And I will give them into the hand of those that seek their life , and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his servants ; but afterwards it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	27	But thou , my servant Jacob , fear not , neither be dismayed , Israel : for behold , I will save thee from afar , and thy seed from the land of their captivity ; and Jacob shall return , and be in rest and at ease , and none shall make [ him ] afraid .
DARBY	Jeremiah	46	28	Fear thou not , my servant Jacob , saith Jehovah : for I am with thee ; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee , but I will not make a full end of thee ; but I will correct thee with judgment , and I will not hold thee altogether guiltless .
DARBY	Jeremiah	47	47	The word of Jehovah that came to the prophet Jeremiah concerning the Philistines , before Pharaoh smote Gazah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	47	2	Thus saith Jehovah : Behold , waters rise up out of the north , and shall become an overflowing flood , and shall overflow the land , and all that is therein ; the city , and them that dwell therein : and the men shall cry , and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	47	3	at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his steeds , at the rushing of his chariots , at the rumbling of his wheels : fathers shall not look back for [ their ] children , from feebleness of hands ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	47	4	because of the day that cometh to lay waste all the Philistines , to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper that remaineth ; for Jehovah will lay waste the Philistines , the remnant of the island of Caphtor .
DARBY	Jeremiah	47	5	Baldness is come upon Gazah ; Ashkelon is cut off , the remnant of their valley : how long wilt thou cut thyself ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	47	6	Alas ! sword of Jehovah , how long wilt thou not be quiet ? Withdraw into thy scabbard , rest , and be still .
DARBY	Jeremiah	47	7	How shouldest thou be quiet ? —For Jehovah hath given it a charge : against Ashkelon , and against the sea shore , there hath he appointed it .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	48	Concerning Moab . Thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Woe unto Nebo ! for it is spoiled ; Kirjathaim is put to shame , it is taken ; Misgab is put to shame and dismayed .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	2	Moab 's praise is no more ; in Heshbon they have devised evil against her : Come , and let us cut her off from [ being ] a nation . Thou also , O Madmen , shalt be cut down ; the sword shall pursue thee .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	3	A voice of crying from Horonaim ; wasting and great destruction !
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	4	Moab is destroyed ; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	5	For by the ascent of Luhith continual weeping shall go up ; for in the descent of Horonaim is heard the anguish of the cry of destruction .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	6	Flee , save your lives , and be like a shrub in the wilderness .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	7	For because thou hast confided in thy works and in thy treasures , thou also shalt be taken , and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity , his priests and his princes together .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	8	And the waster shall come upon every city , that not a city shall escape ; and the valley shall perish , and the plateau shall be destroyed : as Jehovah hath said .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	9	Give wings unto Moab , that she may flee and get away ; and the cities thereof shall become a desolation , without inhabitant .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	10	Cursed be he that doeth the work of Jehovah negligently , and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood !
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	11	Moab hath been at ease from his youth , and hath settled on his lees ; he hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel , neither hath he gone into captivity : therefore his taste hath remained in him , and his scent is not changed .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	12	Therefore behold , days come , saith Jehovah , that I will send unto him pourers that shall pour him off , and shall empty his vessels , and break in pieces his flagons .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	13	And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh , as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel , their confidence .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	14	How do ye say , We are mighty , and men of valour for the war ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	15	Moab is laid waste , and his cities are gone up [ in smoke ] , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , saith the King , whose name is Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	16	The calamity of Moab is near to come , and his affliction hasteth fast .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	17	All ye that are about him , bemoan him ; and all ye that know his name , say , How is the strong staff broken , the beautiful rod !
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	18	Come down from [ thy ] glory and sit in the drought , O inhabitress , daughter of Dibon ; the spoiler of Moab is come up against thee , thy strongholds hath he destroyed .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	19	Stand by the way , and watch , inhabitress of Aroer ; ask him that fleeth , and her that escapeth ; say , What is done ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	20	Moab is put to shame ; for he is broken down : howl and cry ; tell it in Arnon , that Moab is laid waste .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	21	And judgment is come upon the country of the plateau ; upon Holon , and upon Jahzah , and upon Mephaath ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	22	and upon Dibon , and upon Nebo , and upon Beth-diblathaim ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	23	and upon Kirjathaim , and upon Beth-gamul , and upon Beth-meon ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	24	and upon Kerijoth , and upon Bozrah , and upon all the cities of the land of Moab , far and near .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	25	The horn of Moab is cut off , and his arm is broken , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	26	Make him drunken , for he magnified himself against Jehovah ; and Moab shall wallow in his vomit , and he also shall be in derision .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	27	For was not Israel a derision unto thee ? Was he found among thieves , that as oft as thou didst speak of him , thou didst shake the head ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	28	Leave the cities , and dwell in the rocks , ye inhabitants of Moab , and be like the dove , that maketh her nest in the sides of the cave 's mouth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	29	We have heard of the arrogance of Moab , — [ he is ] very proud ; —his loftiness , and his arrogance , and his pride , and the haughtiness of his heart .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	30	I know his wrath , saith Jehovah ; his pratings are vain : they do not as [ they say ] .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	31	Therefore will I howl for Moab , and I will cry out for all Moab : for the men of Kir-heres shall there be moaning .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	32	O vine of Sibmah , I will weep for thee with more than the weeping of Jaazer : thy shoots passed over the sea , they reached to the sea of Jaazer . The spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	33	And joy and gladness is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab ; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses : they shall no more tread with shouting ; the shouting shall be no shouting .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	34	Because of the cry from Heshbon , unto Elaleh , unto Jahaz have they uttered their voice , from Zoar unto Horonaim , [ unto ] Eglath-shelishijah : for even the waters of Nimrim shall become desolations .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	35	And I will cause to cease in Moab , saith Jehovah , him that offereth in the high place , and him that burneth incense to his gods .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	36	Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes , and my heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir-heres ; because the abundance that he hath gotten is perished .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	37	For every head is bald , and every beard clipped ; upon all the hands are cuttings , and upon the loins sackcloth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	38	It is wholly lamentation upon all the housetops of Moab , and in the public places thereof ; for I have broken Moab , like a vessel wherein is no pleasure , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	39	They howl , How is it broken down ! how hath Moab turned the back with shame ! And Moab shall be a derision and a terror to all that are round about him .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	40	For thus saith Jehovah : Behold , he shall fly as an eagle , and shall spread forth his wings over Moab .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	41	Kerijoth is taken , and the strongholds are seized , and at that day the heart of the mighty men of Moab shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	42	And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people , because he hath magnified himself against Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	43	Fear , and the pit , and the snare shall be upon thee , O inhabitant of Moab , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	44	He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare : for I will bring upon her , upon Moab , the year of their visitation , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	45	They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon powerless ; for a fire hath come forth from Heshbon , and a flame from the midst of Sihon , and hath consumed the corner of Moab , and the crown of the head of the sons of tumult .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	46	Woe to thee , Moab ! The people of Chemosh is undone ; for thy sons are taken away in captivity , and thy daughters are captives .
DARBY	Jeremiah	48	47	But I will turn the captivity of Moab at the end of the days , saith Jehovah . Thus far is the judgement of Moab .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	49	Concerning the children of Ammon . Thus saith Jehovah : Hath Israel no sons ? hath he no heir ? Why is Malcam heir of Gad , and his people dwell in the cities thereof ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	2	Therefore behold , days come , saith Jehovah , that I will cause the clamour of war to be heard in Rabbah of the children of Ammon ; and it shall be a desolate heap ; and her towns shall be burned with fire ; and Israel shall possess them that possessed him , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	3	Howl , Heshbon ! for Ai is laid waste ; cry , daughters of Rabbah , gird you with sackcloth , lament and run to and fro within the enclosures : for Malcam shall go into captivity , his priests and his princes together .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	4	Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys ? Thy valley shall flow down , O backsliding daughter , that trusteth in her treasures , [ saying , ] Who shall come against me ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	5	Behold , I will bring a fear upon thee , saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts , from all that are about thee ; and ye shall be driven out every man right forth ; and none shall assemble the fugitives .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	6	And afterwards I will turn the captivity of the children of Ammon , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	7	Concerning Edom . Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Is there no more wisdom in Teman ? is counsel perished from the prudent ? is their wisdom spent ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	8	Flee , turn back , dwell deep down , ye inhabitants of Dedan ! For I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him , the time that I visit him .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	9	If grape-gatherers had come to thee , would they not have left a gleaning ? If thieves by night , they would destroy only till they had enough .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	10	But I have made Esau bare , I have uncovered his secret places , that he is unable to hide himself : his seed is wasted , and his brethren , and his neighbours , and he is not .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	11	Leave thine orphans , I will preserve them alive ; and let thy widows trust in me .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	12	For thus saith Jehovah : Behold , they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink ; and thou indeed , shouldest thou be altogether unpunished ? Thou shalt not go unpunished , but thou shalt surely drink .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	13	For I have sworn by myself , saith Jehovah , that Bozrah shall become an astonishment , a reproach , a waste , and a curse ; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	14	I have heard a rumour from Jehovah , and an ambassador is sent among the nations : —Gather yourselves together , and come against her and rise up for the battle .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	15	For behold , I have made thee small among the nations , despised among men .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	16	Thy terribleness , the pride of thy heart , hath deceived thee , thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock , that holdest the height of the hill . Though thou shouldest make thy nest high as the eagle , I will bring thee down from thence , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	17	And Edom shall be an astonishment : every one that goeth by it shall be astonished , and shall hiss , because of all the plagues thereof .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	18	As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah , and their neighbour cities , saith Jehovah , no one shall dwell there , neither shall a son of man sojourn therein .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	19	Behold , he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the Jordan against the strong habitation ; for I will make them suddenly run away from it ; and who is a chosen [ man ] whom I shall appoint over her ? For who is like me ? and who will assign me a time ? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	20	Therefore hear the counsel of Jehovah , which he hath taken against Edom , and his purposes which he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman : The little ones of the flock shall certainly draw them away ; he shall certainly make their habitation desolate for them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	21	The earth quaketh at the sound of their fall ; there is a cry , the sound whereof is heard in the Red sea .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	22	Behold , he shall come up , and fly as an eagle , and spread forth his wings against Bozrah ; and at that day the heart of the mighty men of Edom shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	23	Concerning Damascus . Hamath is put to shame , and Arpad ; for they have heard evil tidings , they are melted away : there is distress on the sea ; it can not be quiet .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	24	Damascus is grown feeble : she turneth herself to flee , and terror hath seized on her ; trouble and sorrows have taken hold of her as of a woman in travail .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	25	How is not the town of praise forsaken , the city of my joy !
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	26	Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets , and all the men of war be cut off in that day , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	27	And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus , and it shall consume the palaces of Ben-Hadad .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	28	Concerning Kedar , and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor , which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote . Thus saith Jehovah : Arise , go up to Kedar , and spoil the men of the east .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	29	Their tents and their flocks shall they take ; their curtains and all their vessels , and their camels , shall they carry away for themselves ; and they shall cry unto them , Terror on every side !
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	30	Flee , wander very far , dwell deep down , ye inhabitants of Hazor , saith Jehovah ; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you , and hath conceived a purpose against you .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	31	Arise , get you up against the nation at ease , that dwelleth securely , saith Jehovah , which hath neither gates nor bars : they dwell alone .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	32	And their camels shall be a booty , and the multitude of their cattle a spoil ; and I will scatter to every wind them that have the corners [ of their beard ] cut off , and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	33	And Hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals , a desolation for ever . No one shall dwell there , neither shall a son of man sojourn therein .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	34	The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam , in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah , saying ,
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	35	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Behold , I will break the bow of Elam , the chief of their might .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	36	And upon Elam will I bring the four winds , from the four ends of the heavens , and I will scatter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	37	And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies , and before them that seek their life ; and I will bring evil upon them , my fierce anger , saith Jehovah ; and I will send the sword after them , till I have consumed them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	38	And I will set my throne in Elam , and will destroy from thence king and princes , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	49	39	But it shall come to pass at the end of the days , I will turn the captivity of Elam , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	50	The word that Jehovah spoke concerning Babylon , concerning the land of the Chaldeans , through Jeremiah the prophet .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	2	Declare ye among the nations , and publish , and lift up a banner ; publish , conceal not ! Say , Babylon is taken , Bel is put to shame , Merodach is dismayed : her images are put to shame , her idols are dismayed .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	3	For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her , which shall make her land desolate , and none shall dwell therein : both man and beast are fled ; they are gone .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	4	In those days , and at that time , saith Jehovah , the children of Israel shall come , they and the children of Judah together , going and weeping as they go , and shall seek Jehovah their God .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	5	They shall inquire concerning Zion , with their faces thitherward , [ saying , ] Come , and let us join ourselves to Jehovah , in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	6	My people are lost sheep ; their shepherds have caused them to go astray , they turned them away on the mountains : they went from mountain to hill , they forgot their resting-place .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	7	All that found them devoured them , and their adversaries said , We are not guilty , because they have sinned against Jehovah , the habitation of righteousness , even Jehovah , the hope of their fathers .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	8	Flee out of the midst of Babylon , and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans , and be as the he-goats before the flock .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	9	For behold , I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon , an assemblage of great nations from the north country ; and they shall set themselves in array against her : from thence shall she be taken . Their arrows shall be as those of a mighty expert man : none shall return empty .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	10	And Chaldea shall be a spoil : all the spoilers thereof shall be satiated , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	11	For ye rejoiced , for ye triumphed , ye plunderers of my heritage ; for ye have been wanton as the heifer at grass , and neighed as steeds .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	12	Your mother hath been sorely put to shame ; she that bore you hath been covered with reproach : behold , [ she is become ] hindmost of the nations , a wilderness , a dry land , and a desert .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	13	Because of the wrath of Jehovah , it shall not be inhabited , but it shall be wholly desolate ; every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished , and shall hiss , because of all her plagues .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	14	Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about , all ye that bend the bow ; shoot at her , spare no arrows : for she hath sinned against Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	15	Shout against her round about : she hath given her hand ; her ramparts are fallen , her walls are thrown down : for this is the vengeance of Jehovah . Take vengeance upon her ; as she hath done , do unto her .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	16	Cut off the sower from Babylon , and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest . For fear of the oppressing sword let them turn every one to his people , and let them flee every one to his own land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	17	Israel is a hunted sheep ; the lions have driven him away : first the king of Assyria devoured him , and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	18	Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : Behold , I will visit the king of Babylon and his land , like as I have visited the king of Assyria .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	19	And I will bring Israel again to his pasture , and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan , and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and in Gilead .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	20	In those days , and at that time , saith Jehovah , the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sins of Judah , and they shall not be found : for I will pardon those whom I leave remaining .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	21	Go up against the land of double rebellion , against it , and against the inhabitants of visitation ; waste and utterly destroy after them , saith Jehovah , and do according to all that I have commanded thee .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	22	A sound of battle is in the land , and great destruction .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	23	How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken ! How is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations !
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	24	I have laid a snare for thee , and thou , Babylon , art also taken , and thou wast not aware ; thou art found , and also caught , for thou hast contended with Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	25	Jehovah hath opened his armoury , and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation ; for this is a work for the Lord , Jehovah of hosts , in the land of the Chaldeans .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	26	Come ye against her from every quarter , open her storehouses ; pile her up like sheaves , and destroy her utterly : let nothing of her be left .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	27	Slay all her bullocks ; let them go down to the slaughter : woe unto them ! for their day is come , the time of their visitation .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	28	The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon , to declare in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God , the vengeance of his temple .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	29	Call together the archers against Babylon , all those that bend the bow : encamp against her round about ; let there be no escaping : recompense her according to her work ; according to all that she hath done , do unto her : for she hath acted proudly against Jehovah , against the Holy One of Israel .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	30	Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets ; and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	31	Behold , I am against thee , proud one , saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts ; for thy day is come , the time that I visit thee :
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	32	and the proud one shall stumble and fall , and none shall raise him up ; yea , I will kindle a fire in his cities , and it shall devour all that are round about him .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	33	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : The children of Israel and the children of Judah were together oppressed ; and all that took them captives held them fast : they refused to let them go .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	34	Their Redeemer is strong ; Jehovah of hosts is his name : he will thoroughly plead their cause , that he may give rest to the land , and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	35	The sword is upon the Chaldeans , saith Jehovah , and upon the inhabitants of Babylon , and upon her princes , and upon her wise men ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	36	the sword is upon the liars , and they shall become fools ; the sword is upon her mighty men , and they shall be dismayed ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	37	the sword is upon their horses , and upon their chariots , and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her , and they shall become as women ; the sword is upon her treasures , and they shall be robbed :
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	38	a drought is upon her waters , and they shall be dried up ; for it is a land of graven images , and they are mad after frightful idols .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	39	Therefore wild beasts of the desert with jackals shall dwell there , and ostriches shall dwell therein ; and it shall be no more inhabited for ever , neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	40	As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah , and their neighbour cities , saith Jehovah , no one shall dwell there , neither shall a son of man sojourn therein .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	41	Behold , a people cometh from the north , and a great nation . And many kings shall arise from the uttermost parts of the earth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	42	They lay hold of bow and spear ; they are cruel , and will not shew mercy ; their voice roareth like the sea , and they ride upon horses—set in array like a man for the battle , against thee , O daughter of Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	43	The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them , and his hands wax feeble ; trouble hath taken hold of him , pangs as of a woman in travail .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	44	Behold , he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of the Jordan against the strong habitation ; for I will make him suddenly run away from it ; and who is a chosen [ man ] whom I may appoint over her ? For who is like me ? and who will assign me a time ? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me ?
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	45	Therefore hear the counsel of Jehovah , which he hath taken against Babylon , and his purposes which he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans : The little ones of the flock shall certainly draw them away ; he shall certainly make their habitation desolate for them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	50	46	At the sound of the taking of Babylon the earth hath quaked , and the cry is heard among the nations .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	51	—We are put to shame , for we have heard reproach ; confusion hath covered our face : for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of Jehovah 's house .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	2	and I will send unto Babylon strangers , who shall fan her , and shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	3	Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow , and against him that lifteth himself up in his coat of mail ; and spare not her young men : destroy utterly all her host .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	4	And the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans , and they that are thrust through in her streets .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	5	For Israel is not forsaken , nor Judah of his God , of Jehovah of hosts ; for their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	6	Flee out of the midst of Babylon , and save every man his life ; be ye not cut off in her iniquity : for this is the time of Jehovah 's vengeance : he shall render unto her a recompence .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	7	Babylon hath been a golden cup in Jehovah 's hand , that made all the earth drunken : the nations have drunk of her wine ; therefore have the nations become mad .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	8	Babylon is suddenly fallen and ruined . Howl over her ; take balm for her pain , if so be she may be healed .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	9	We have treated Babylon , but she is not healed : forsake her , and let us go every one into his own country ; for her judgment reacheth unto the heavens , and is lifted up to the skies .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	10	Jehovah hath brought forth our righteousness : come , and let us declare in Zion the work of Jehovah our God .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	11	Sharpen the arrows ; take the shields . Jehovah hath stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes ; for his purpose is against Babylon , to destroy it ; for this is the vengeance of Jehovah , the vengeance of his temple .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	12	Lift up a banner towards the walls of Babylon , make the watch strong , set the watchmen , prepare the ambushes ; for Jehovah hath both devised and done that which he spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	13	Thou that dwellest upon many waters , abundant in treasures , thine end is come , the measure of thy rapacity .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	14	Jehovah of hosts hath sworn by himself , I will assuredly fill thee with men , as with caterpillars ; and they shall raise a shout against thee .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	15	He hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and hath stretched out the heavens by his understanding .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	16	When he uttereth his voice , there is a tumult of waters in the heavens , and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the end of the earth ; he maketh lightnings for the rain , and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	17	Every man is become brutish , so as to have no knowledge ; every founder is put to shame by the graven image , for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	18	They are vanity , a work of delusion : in the time of their visitation they shall perish .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	19	The portion of Jacob is not like them ; for it is he that hath formed all things : and [ Israel ] is the rod of his inheritance : Jehovah of hosts is his name .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	20	Thou art my maul , [ my ] weapons of war : and with thee I will break in pieces the nations , and I will with thee destroy kingdoms ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	21	and with thee I will break in pieces the horse and his rider ; and with thee I will break in pieces the chariot and its driver ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	22	and with thee will I break in pieces man and woman ; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young ; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	23	and with thee will I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock ; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen ; and with thee will I break in pieces governors and rulers .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	24	And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea , in your sight , all their evil which they have done in Zion , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	25	Behold , I am against thee , mount of destruction , saith Jehovah , which destroyest all the earth ; and I will stretch out my hand upon thee , and roll thee down from the rocks , and will make thee a burning mountain .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	26	And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner , nor a stone for foundations ; for thou shalt be desolate for ever , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	27	Lift up a banner in the land , blow the trumpet among the nations , prepare nations against her ; call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat , Minni , and Ashkenaz ; appoint a captain against her ; cause the horses to come up as the bristly caterpillars .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	28	Prepare nations against her , the kings of the Medes , their governors and all their rulers , yea , all the land of their dominion .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	29	And the land trembleth and is in pain ; for the purposes of Jehovah against Babylon do stand , to make the land of Babylon a desolation , without inhabitant .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	30	The mighty men of Babylon have ceased to fight , they are sitting in the fortresses ; their might hath failed , they are become as women : they have set her dwelling places on fire ; her bars are broken .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	31	Courier runneth to meet courier , and messenger to meet messenger , to announce to the king of Babylon that his city is taken from end to end ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	32	and the passages are seized , and the reedy places are burnt with fire , and the men of war are affrighted .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	33	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel : The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor , at the time of its being trodden ; yet a little while , and the time of harvest shall come for her .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	34	Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me , he hath crushed me , he hath made me an empty vessel ; he hath swallowed me up like a dragon , he hath filled his belly with my delicates , he hath cast me out .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	35	The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon , shall the inhabitress of Zion say ; and , My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea , shall Jerusalem say .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	36	Therefore thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I will plead thy cause , and take vengeance for thee ; and I will dry up her sea , and make her spring dry .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	37	And Babylon shall become heaps , a dwelling-place of jackals , an astonishment , and a hissing , without inhabitant .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	38	They shall roar together like young lions , growl as lions ' whelps .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	39	When they are heated , I will prepare their drink , and I will make them drunken , that they may exult , and sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	40	I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter , like rams with he-goats .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	41	How is Sheshach taken ! and how is the praise of the whole earth seized ! How is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations !
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	42	The sea is come up upon Babylon : she is covered with the multitude of its waves .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	43	Her cities are become a desolation , a dry land , and a desert , a land wherein no one dwelleth , neither doth a son of man pass thereby .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	44	And I will punish Bel in Babylon , and I will bring forth out of his mouth what he hath swallowed up ; and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him : yea , the wall of Babylon is fallen .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	45	Go ye out of the midst of her , my people , and deliver every man his soul from the fierce anger of Jehovah !
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	46	lest your heart faint , and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land ; for a rumour shall come [ one ] year , and after that a rumour in [ another ] year , and violence in the earth , ruler against ruler .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	47	Therefore behold , days are coming when I will punish the graven images of Babylon ; and her whole land shall be put to shame , and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	48	And the heavens and the earth , and all that is therein , shall shout aloud over Babylon ; for out of the north the spoilers shall come against her , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	49	As Babylon caused the slain of Israel to fall , so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	50	Ye that have escaped the sword , go , stand not still : remember Jehovah from afar , and let Jerusalem come into your mind .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	52	—Therefore behold , days come , saith Jehovah , that I will punish her graven images ; and throughout her land the wounded shall groan .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	53	Though Babylon should mount up to the heavens , and though she should fortify the height of her strength , yet from me shall spoilers come unto her , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	54	The sound of a cry [ cometh ] from Babylon , and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	55	for Jehovah spoileth Babylon , and he will destroy out of her the great voice ; and their waves roar like great waters , the noise of their voice resoundeth .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	56	For the spoiler is come against her , against Babylon , and her mighty men are taken ; their bows are broken in pieces ; for Jehovah , the God of recompences , will certainly requite .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	57	And I will make drunk her princes , and her wise men , her governors , and her rulers , and her mighty men ; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , saith the King , whose name is Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	58	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly laid bare , and her high gates shall be burned with fire ; so that the peoples will have laboured in vain , and the nations for the fire : and they shall be weary .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	59	The word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Nerijah , the son of Mahseiah , when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign . Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	60	And Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon , all these words that are written against Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	61	And Jeremiah said to Seraiah , When thou comest to Babylon , see that thou read all these words ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	62	and say , Jehovah , thou hast spoken concerning this place , that thou wilt cut it off , so that none shall dwell in it , neither man nor beast , but that it shall be desolate for ever .
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	63	And it shall be , when thou hast ended reading this book , [ that ] thou shalt bind a stone to it , and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	51	64	and shalt say , Thus shall Babylon sink , and shall not rise , because of the evil that I will bring upon it : and they shall be weary . Thus far the words of Jeremiah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	52	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem ; and his mother 's name was Hamutal , daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	2	And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah , according to all that Jehoiakim had done .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	3	For , because the anger of Jehovah was against Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence , Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	4	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , on the tenth of the month , [ that ] Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem ; and they encamped against it , and built turrets against it round about .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	5	And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	6	In the fourth month , on the ninth of the month , the famine prevailed in the city , and there was no bread for the people of the land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	7	And the city was broken into : and all the men of war fled , and went forth out of the city by night , by the way of the gate between the two walls , which was by the king 's garden ( now the Chaldeans were near the city round about ) ; and they went the way toward the plain .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	8	And the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king , and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho ; and all his army was scattered from him .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	9	And they took the king , and brought him up to the king of Babylon , unto Riblah in the land of Hamath , and he pronounced judgment upon him .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	10	And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes ; and he slaughtered also all the princes of Judah in Riblah .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	11	And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah , and bound him with chains of brass ; and the king of Babylon carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison till the day of his death .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	12	And in the fifth month , on the tenth of the month , which was in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , Nebuzar-adan , captain of the body-guard , who stood before the king of Babylon , came unto Jerusalem ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	13	and he burned the house of Jehovah , and the king 's house , and all the houses of Jerusalem ; and every great [ man 's ] house he burned with fire .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	14	And all the army of the Chaldeans , that were with the captain of the body-guard , broke down all the walls of Jerusalem round about .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	15	And Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard carried away captive of the poorest sort of the people , and the rest of the people that were left in the city , and the deserters that had deserted to the king of Babylon , and the rest of the multitude .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	16	But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard left of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	17	And the brazen pillars that were in the house of Jehovah , and the bases , and the brazen sea that was in the house of Jehovah , the Chaldeans broke up , and carried all the brass thereof to Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	18	The pots also , and the shovels , and the knives , and the bowls , and the cups , and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered , they took away .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	19	And the basons and the censers , and the bowls , and the pots , and the candlesticks , and the cups , and the goblets , that which was of gold in gold , and that which was of silver in silver , the captain of the body-guard took away .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	20	The two pillars , the one sea , and the twelve brazen oxen that formed the bases , which king Solomon had made for the house of Jehovah : for the brass of all these vessels there was no weight .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	21	And as to the pillars : the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits , and a line of twelve cubits encompassed it ; and the thickness thereof was four fingers : it was hollow .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	22	And the capital upon it was brass , and the height of the one capital [ was ] five cubits ; and the network and the pomegranates , upon the capital round about , all of brass ; and similarly for the second pillar , and the pomegranates .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	23	And there were ninety-six pomegranates on the [ four ] sides ; all the pomegranates upon the network were a hundred round about .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	24	And the captain of the body-guard took Seraiah the chief priest , and Zephaniah the second priest , and the three doorkeepers .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	25	And out of the city he took a eunuch that was set over the men of war , and seven men of them that were in the king 's presence , who were found in the city , and the scribe of the captain of the host , who enrolled the people of the land . And sixty men of the people of the land that were found in the midst of the city .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	26	And Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard took them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	27	and the king of Babylon smote them , and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath . Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his land .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	28	This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive : in the seventh year three thousand and twenty-three Jews ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	29	in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar [ he carried away captive ] from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	30	in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar , Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five persons : all the persons were four thousand six hundred .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	31	And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah , in the twelfth month , on the twenty-fifth of the month , [ that ] Evil-Merodach king of Babylon , in the year that he began to reign , lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah , and brought him forth out of prison ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	32	and he spoke kindly unto him , and set his seat above the seat of the kings that were with him in Babylon .
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	33	And he changed his prison garments ; and he ate bread before him continually all the days of his life ;
DARBY	Jeremiah	52	34	and his allowance was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	1	How doth the city sit solitary [ that ] was full of people ! She that was great among the nations is become as a widow ; the princess among the provinces is become tributary !
DARBY	Lamentations	1	2	She weepeth sore in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks ; among all her lovers she hath no comforter ; all her friends have dealt treacherously with her , they are become her enemies .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	3	Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction , and because of great servitude ; she dwelleth among the nations , she findeth no rest : all her pursuers have overtaken her within the straits .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	4	The ways of Zion do mourn , because none come to the solemn assembly : all her gates are desolate ; her priests sigh , her virgins are in grief ; and as for her , she is in bitterness .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	5	Her adversaries have become the head , her enemies prosper ; for Jehovah hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions : her children are gone into captivity before the adversary .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	6	And from the daughter of Zion all her splendour is departed : her princes are become like harts that find no pasture ; and they are gone without strength before the pursuer .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	7	In the days of her affliction and of her wanderings , since her people fell into the hand of an adversary , and none did help her , Jerusalem remembereth all her precious things which she had in the days of old : the adversaries have seen her , they mock at her ruin .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	8	Jerusalem hath grievously sinned ; therefore is she removed as an impurity : all that honoured her despise her because they have seen her nakedness ; and she sigheth , and turneth backward .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	9	Her impurity was in her skirts , she remembered not her latter end ; and she came down wonderfully : she hath no comforter . Jehovah , behold my affliction ; for the enemy hath magnified himself .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	10	The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her precious things ; for she hath seen the nations enter into her sanctuary , concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	11	All her people sigh , they seek bread ; they have given their precious things for food to revive [ their ] soul . See , Jehovah , and consider , for I am become vile .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	12	Is it nothing to you , all ye that pass by ? Behold , and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow , which is done unto me , whom Jehovah hath afflicted in the day of his fierce anger .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	13	From on high hath he sent fire into my bones , and it prevaileth against them ; he hath spread a net for my feet ; he hath turned me back ; he hath made me desolate [ and ] faint all the day .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	14	The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand : they are wreathed , they are come up upon my neck ; he hath made my strength to fail ; the Lord hath delivered me into hands out of which I am not able to rise up .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	15	The Lord hath cast down all my mighty men in the midst of me ; he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men ; the Lord hath trodden as a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	16	For these things I weep ; mine eye , mine eye runneth down with water : for the comforter that should revive my soul is far from me ; my children are desolate , for the enemy hath prevailed .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	17	Zion spreadeth forth her hands ; there is none to comfort her ; Jehovah hath commanded concerning Jacob , [ that ] his adversaries [ should be ] round about him ; Jerusalem is as an impurity among them .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	18	Jehovah is righteous ; for I have rebelled against his commandment . Hear , I pray you , all ye peoples , and behold my sorrow . My virgins and my young men are gone into captivity .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	19	I called for my lovers , they have deceived me ; my priests and mine elders have expired in the city , while they sought them food to revive their soul .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	20	See , Jehovah , for I am in distress , my bowels are troubled ; my heart is turned within me , for I have grievously rebelled : without , the sword hath bereaved [ me ] , within , it is as death .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	21	They have heard that I sigh : I have no comforter : all mine enemies have heard of my calamity ; they are glad that thou hast done it . Thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called , and they shall be like unto me .
DARBY	Lamentations	1	22	Let all their wickedness come before thee ; and do unto them , as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions : for my sighs are many , and my heart is faint .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	2	The Lord hath swallowed up all the dwellings of Jacob , and hath not spared ; he hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah : he hath brought [ them ] down to the ground ; he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	3	He hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel : he hath withdrawn his right hand from before the enemy ; and he burned up Jacob like a flaming fire , devouring round about .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	4	He hath bent his bow like an enemy ; he stood with his right hand as an adversary , and hath slain all that was pleasant to the eye : in the tent of the daughter of Zion , he hath poured out his fury like fire .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	5	The Lord is become as an enemy : he hath swallowed up Israel ; he hath swallowed up all her palaces ; he hath destroyed his strongholds , and hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	6	And he hath violently cast down his enclosure as a garden ; he hath destroyed his place of assembly : Jehovah hath caused set feast and sabbath to be forgotten in Zion , and hath despised in the indignation of his anger king and priest .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	7	The Lord hath cast off his altar , he hath rejected his sanctuary ; he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces : they have made a noise in the house of Jehovah , as on the day of a set feast .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	8	Jehovah hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion : he hath stretched out the line , he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying ; and he hath made the rampart and the wall to lament : they languish together .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	9	Her gates are sunk into the ground ; he hath destroyed and broken her bars . Her king and her princes are among the nations : the law is no [ more ] ; her prophets also find no vision from Jehovah .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	10	The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground , they keep silence ; they have cast dust upon their heads , they have girded themselves with sackcloth : the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their head to the ground .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	11	Mine eyes are consumed with tears , my bowels are troubled ; my liver is poured upon the earth , because of the ruin of the daughter of my people ; because infant and suckling swoon in the streets of the city .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	12	They say to their mothers , Where is corn and wine ? when they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city ; when they pour out their soul into their mothers ' bosom .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	13	What shall I take to witness for thee ? what shall I liken unto thee , daughter of Jerusalem ? What shall I equal to thee , that I may comfort thee , virgin daughter of Zion ? For thy ruin is great as the sea : who will heal thee ?
DARBY	Lamentations	2	14	Thy prophets have seen vanity and folly for thee ; and they have not revealed thine iniquity , to turn away thy captivity ; but have seen for thee burdens of falsehood and causes of expulsion .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	15	All that pass by clap [ their ] hands at thee ; they hiss and shake their head at the daughter of Jerusalem : Is this the city which they called , The perfection of beauty , The joy of the whole earth ?
DARBY	Lamentations	2	16	All thine enemies open their mouth against thee , they hiss and gnash the teeth : they say , We have swallowed [ her ] up ; this is forsooth the day that we looked for : we have found , we have seen [ it ] .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	17	Jehovah hath done what he had devised ; he hath fulfilled his word which he had commanded from the days of old : he hath thrown down , and hath not spared , and he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee ; he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	18	Their heart cried unto the Lord . O wall of the daughter of Zion , let tears run down like a torrent day and night : give thyself no respite ; let not the apple of thine eye rest .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	19	Arise , cry out in the night , in the beginning of the watches ; pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord : lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children , who faint from hunger at the top of all the streets .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	20	See , Jehovah , and consider to whom thou hast done this ! Shall the women eat their fruit , the infants that they nursed ? Shall priest and prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord ?
DARBY	Lamentations	2	21	The child and the old man lie on the ground in the streets ; my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword : thou hast slain [ them ] in the day of thine anger ; thou hast killed , thou hast not spared .
DARBY	Lamentations	2	22	Thou hast called up , as on the day of a set feast , my terrors on every side ; and in the day of Jehovah 's anger there was none that escaped or remained : those that I have nursed and brought up hath mine enemy consumed .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	3	Surely against me hath he turned again and again his hand all the day .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	2	Me hath he led , and brought into darkness , and not into light .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	4	My flesh and my skin hath he wasted away , he hath broken my bones .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	5	He hath built against me , and encompassed [ me ] with gall and toil .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	6	He hath made me to dwell in dark places as those that have been long dead .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	7	He hath hedged me about that I can not get out : he hath made my chain heavy .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	8	Even when I cry and shout , he shutteth out my prayer .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	9	He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone , he hath made my paths crooked .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	10	He is unto me [ as ] a bear lying in wait , a lion in secret places .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	11	He hath turned aside my ways , and pulled me in pieces ; he hath made me desolate .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	12	He hath bent his bow , and set me as a mark for the arrow .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	13	He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	14	I am become a derision to all my people ; their song all the day .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	15	He hath sated me with bitterness , he hath made me drunk with wormwood .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	16	He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones , he hath covered me with ashes .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	17	And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace : I have forgotten prosperity .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	18	And I said , My strength is perished , and my hope in Jehovah .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	19	Remember thou mine affliction and my wandering , the wormwood and the gall .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	20	My soul hath [ them ] constantly in remembrance , and is humbled in me .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	21	—This I recall to heart , therefore have I hope .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	22	It is of Jehovah 's loving-kindness we are not consumed , because his compassions fail not ;
DARBY	Lamentations	3	23	they are new every morning : great is thy faithfulness .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	24	Jehovah is my portion , saith my soul ; therefore will I hope in him .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	25	Jehovah is good unto them that wait for him , to the soul [ that ] seeketh him .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	26	It is good that one should both wait , and that in silence , for the salvation of Jehovah .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	27	It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth :
DARBY	Lamentations	3	28	He sitteth solitary and keepeth silence , because he hath laid it upon him ;
DARBY	Lamentations	3	29	he putteth his mouth in the dust , if so be there may be hope ;
DARBY	Lamentations	3	30	he giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him ; he is filled full with reproach .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	31	For the Lord will not cast off for ever ;
DARBY	Lamentations	3	32	but if he have caused grief , he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses :
DARBY	Lamentations	3	33	for he doth not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	34	To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth ,
DARBY	Lamentations	3	35	to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High ,
DARBY	Lamentations	3	36	to wrong a man in his cause , —will not the Lord see it ?
DARBY	Lamentations	3	37	Who is he that saith , and there cometh to pass , what the Lord hath not commanded ?
DARBY	Lamentations	3	38	Out of the mouth of the Most High doth not there proceed evil and good ?
DARBY	Lamentations	3	39	Wherefore doth a living man complain , a man for the punishment of his sins ?
DARBY	Lamentations	3	40	Let us search and try our ways , and turn again to Jehovah .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	41	Let us lift up our heart with [ our ] hands unto God in the heavens .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	42	We have transgressed and have rebelled : thou hast not pardoned .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	43	Thou hast covered thyself with anger , and pursued us ; thou hast slain , thou hast not spared .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	44	Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud , that prayer should not pass through .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	45	Thou hast made us the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	46	All our enemies have opened their mouth against us .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	47	Fear and the pit are come upon us , devastation and ruin .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	48	Mine eye runneth down with streams of water for the ruin of the daughter of my people .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	49	Mine eye poureth down , and ceaseth not , without any intermission ,
DARBY	Lamentations	3	50	till Jehovah look down and behold from the heavens .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	51	Mine eye affecteth my soul , because of all the daughters of my city .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	52	They that are mine enemies without cause have chased me sore like a bird .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	53	They have cut off my life in a pit , and cast a stone upon me .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	54	Waters streamed over my head ; I said , I am cut off .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	55	I called upon thy name , Jehovah , out of the lowest pit .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	56	Thou hast heard my voice : hide not thine ear at my sighing , at my cry .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	57	Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee ; thou saidst , Fear not .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	58	Lord , thou hast pleaded the cause of my soul , thou hast redeemed my life .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	59	Jehovah , thou hast seen my wrong : judge thou my cause .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	60	Thou hast seen all their vengeance , all their imaginations against me .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	61	Thou hast heard their reproach , O Jehovah , all their imaginations against me ;
DARBY	Lamentations	3	62	the lips of those that rise up against me and their meditation against me all the day .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	63	Behold thou their sitting down and their rising up : I am their song .
DARBY	Lamentations	3	64	Render unto them a recompence , O Jehovah , according to the work of their hands ;
DARBY	Lamentations	3	65	give them obduracy of heart , thy curse unto them ;
DARBY	Lamentations	3	66	pursue them in anger , and destroy them from under the heavens of Jehovah .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	4	The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst ; the young children ask bread , no man breaketh it unto them .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	2	The sons of Zion , so precious , comparable to fine gold , how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers , the work of the hands of the potter !
DARBY	Lamentations	4	3	Even the jackals offer the breast , they give suck to their young ; the daughter of my people is become cruel , like the ostriches in the wilderness .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	5	They that fed delicately are desolate in the streets ; they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dung-hills .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	6	And the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the reward of the sin of Sodom , which was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands were violently laid upon her .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	7	Her Nazarites were purer than snow , whiter than milk ; they were more ruddy in body than rubies , their figure was as sapphire .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	8	Their visage is darker than blackness , they are not known in the streets ; their skin cleaveth to their bones , it is withered , it is become like a stick .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	9	The slain with the sword are happier than the slain with hunger ; for these pine away , stricken through for want of the fruits of the field .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	10	The hands of pitiful women have boiled their own children : they were their meat in the ruin of the daughter of my people .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	11	Jehovah hath accomplished his fury ; he hath poured out his fierce anger , and hath kindled a fire in Zion , which hath consumed the foundations thereof .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	12	The kings of the earth , and all the inhabitants of the world , would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should enter into the gates of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	13	[ It is ] for the sins of her prophets , [ and ] the iniquities of her priests , who have shed the blood of the righteous in the midst of her .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	14	They wandered about blind in the streets ; they were polluted with blood , so that men could not touch their garments .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	15	They cried unto them , Depart ! Unclean ! Depart ! depart , touch not ! When they fled away , and wandered about , it was said among the nations , They shall no more sojourn [ there ] .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	16	The face of Jehovah hath divided them ; he will no more regard them . They respected not the persons of the priests , they favoured not the aged .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	17	Our eyes still failed for our vain help ; in our watching , we have watched for a nation that did not save .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	18	They hunted our steps , that we could not go in our streets : our end is near , our days are fulfilled ; for our end is come .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	19	Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens ; they chased us hotly upon the mountains , they laid wait for us in the wilderness .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	20	The breath of our nostrils , the anointed of Jehovah , was taken in their pits ; of whom we said , Under his shadow we shall live among the nations .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	21	Rejoice and be glad , daughter of Edom , that dwellest in the land of Uz : the cup shall pass also unto thee ; thou shalt be drunken , and make thyself naked .
DARBY	Lamentations	4	22	The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished , O daughter of Zion ; he will no more carry thee away into captivity . He will visit thine iniquity , O daughter of Edom ; he will discover thy sins .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	5	Our pursuers are on our necks : we are weary , we have no rest .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	2	Our inheritance is turned to strangers , our houses to aliens .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	3	We are orphans and fatherless , our mothers are as widows .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	4	Our water have we to drink for money , our wood cometh unto us for a price .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	6	We have given the hand to Egypt , [ and ] to Asshur , to be satisfied with bread .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	7	Our fathers have sinned , [ and ] they are not ; and we bear their iniquities .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	8	Bondmen rule over us : there is no deliverer out of their hand .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	9	We have to get our bread at the risk of our lives , because of the sword of the wilderness .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	10	Our skin gloweth like an oven , because of the burning heat of the famine .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	11	They have ravished the women in Zion , the maids in the cities of Judah .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	12	Princes were hanged up by their hand ; the faces of elders were not honoured .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	13	The young men have borne the mill , and the youths have stumbled under the wood .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	14	The elders have ceased from the gate , the young men from their music .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	15	The joy of our heart hath ceased ; our dance is turned into mourning .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	16	The crown is fallen from our head : woe unto us , for we have sinned !
DARBY	Lamentations	5	17	For this our heart is faint ; for these things our eyes have grown dim ,
DARBY	Lamentations	5	18	Because of the mountain of Zion , which is desolate : foxes walk over it .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	19	Thou , Jehovah , dwellest for ever ; thy throne is from generation to generation .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	20	Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever , dost thou forsake us so long time ?
DARBY	Lamentations	5	21	Turn thou us unto thee , Jehovah , and we shall be turned ; renew our days as of old .
DARBY	Lamentations	5	22	Or is it that thou hast utterly rejected us ? Wouldest thou be exceeding wroth against us ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	1	Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year , in the fourth [ month ] , on the fifth of the month , as I was among the captives by the river Chebar , the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	2	On the fifth of the month , ( it was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin 's captivity , )
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	3	the word of Jehovah came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest , the son of Buzi , in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar ; and the hand of Jehovah was there upon him .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	4	And I looked , and behold , a stormy wind came out of the north , a great cloud , and a fire infolding itself , and a brightness was about it , and out of the midst thereof as the look of glowing brass , out of the midst of the fire .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	5	Also out of the midst thereof , the likeness of four living creatures . And this was their appearance : they had the likeness of a man .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	6	And every one had four faces , and every one of them had four wings .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	7	And their feet were straight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf 's foot ; and they sparkled as the look of burnished brass .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	8	And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides ; and they four had their faces and their wings :
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	9	their wings were joined one to another ; they turned not when they went ; they went every one straight forward .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	10	And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man ; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side ; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side ; they four had also the face of an eagle .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	11	And their faces and their wings were parted above ; two [ wings ] of every one were joined one to another , and two covered their bodies .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	12	And they went every one straight forward : whither the Spirit was to go , they went ; they turned not when they went .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	13	And as for the likeness of the living creatures , their appearance was like burning coals of fire , as the appearance of torches : it went up and down among the living creatures ; and the fire was bright ; and out of the fire went forth lightning .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	14	And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	15	And I looked at the living creatures , and behold , one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures , toward their four faces .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	16	The appearance of the wheels and their work was as the look of a chrysolite ; and they four had one likeness ; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	17	When they went , they went upon their four sides ; they turned not when they went .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	18	As for their rims , they were high and dreadful ; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	19	And when the living creatures went , the wheels went beside them ; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	20	Whithersoever the Spirit was to go , they went , thither would [ their ] spirit go ; and the wheels were lifted up along with them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	21	When those went , they went ; and when those stood , they stood ; and when those were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up along with them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	22	And there was the likeness of an expanse over the heads of the living creature , as the look of the terrible crystal , stretched forth over their heads above .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	23	And under the expanse were their wings straight , the one toward the other : every one had two which covered on this side , and every one had two which covered on that side their bodies .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	24	And when they went , I heard the noise of their wings , like the noise of great waters , as the voice of the Almighty , a tumultuous noise , as the noise of a host : when they stood , they let down their wings ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	25	and there was a voice from above the expanse that was over their heads . When they stood , they let down their wings .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	26	And above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone ; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	27	And I saw as the look of glowing brass , as the appearance of fire , within it round about ; from the appearance of his loins and upward , and from the appearance of his loins and downward , I saw as it were the appearance of fire , and it had brightness round about .
DARBY	Ezekiel	1	28	As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain , so was the appearance of the brightness round about . This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah . And when I saw , I fell on my face , and I heard a voice of one that spoke .
DARBY	Ezekiel	2	2	And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke unto me , and set me upon my feet ; and I heard him that spoke unto me .
DARBY	Ezekiel	2	3	And he said unto me , Son of man , I send thee to the children of Israel , to nations that are rebellious , which have rebelled against me : they and their fathers have transgressed against me unto this very day ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	2	4	and these children are impudent and hard-hearted : I am sending thee unto them ; and thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	2	5	And they , whether they will hear or whether they will forbear—for they are a rebellious house—yet shall they know that there hath been a prophet among them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	2	6	And thou , son of man , be not afraid of them , and be not afraid of their words ; for briars and thorns are with thee , and thou dwellest among scorpions : be not afraid of their words , and be not dismayed at their faces ; for they are a rebellious house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	2	7	And thou shalt speak my words unto them , whether they will hear or whether they will forbear ; for they are rebellious .
DARBY	Ezekiel	2	8	And thou , son of man , hear what I say unto thee ; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house : open thy mouth , and eat that I give thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	2	9	And I looked , and behold , a hand was put forth toward me ; and behold , a roll of a book therein .
DARBY	Ezekiel	2	10	And he spread it out before me ; and it was written within and without ; and there were written in it lamentations , and mourning , and woe .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	3	And he said unto me , Son of man , cause thy belly to eat , and fill thy bowels with this roll which I give thee . And I ate , and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	2	So I opened my mouth , and he caused me to eat that roll .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	4	And he said unto me , Son of man , go , get thee unto the house of Israel , and speak with my words unto them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	5	For thou art not sent to a people of strange language , and of difficult speech , [ but ] to the house of Israel ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	6	not to many peoples of strange language and of difficult speech , whose words thou canst not understand : had I sent thee to them , would they not hearken unto thee ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	7	But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee , for none of them will hearken unto me . For all the house of Israel are hard of forehead and stiff of heart .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	8	Behold , I have made thy face hard against their faces , and thy forehead hard against their foreheads .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	9	As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead . Fear them not , neither be dismayed at them , for they are a rebellious house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	10	And he said unto me , Son of man , all my words which I shall speak unto thee , receive in thy heart , and hear with thine ears ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	11	and go , get thee to them of the captivity , unto the children of thy people , and speak unto them , and tell them , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah , —whether they will hear or whether they will forbear .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	12	And the Spirit lifted me up , and I heard behind me the sound of a great rushing , [ saying , ] Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place !
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	13	—and the sound of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another , and the sound of the wheels beside them , and the sound of a great rushing .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	14	And the Spirit lifted me up , and took me away ; and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit , and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	15	And I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib , that dwelt by the river Chebar , and I sat where they sat ; and I sat there astonied among them seven days .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	16	And it came to pass at the end of seven days , that the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	17	Son of man , I have appointed thee a watchman unto the house of Israel , and thou shalt hear the word from my mouth , and give them warning from me .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	18	When I say unto the wicked , Thou shalt certainly die ; and thou givest him not warning , nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way , that he may live : the same wicked [ man ] shall die in his iniquity ; but his blood will I require at thy hand .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	19	But if thou warn the wicked , and he turn not from his wickedness , nor from his wicked way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered thy soul .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	20	And when a righteous [ man ] doth turn from his righteousness , and do what is wrong , and I lay a stumbling-block before him , he shall die ; because thou hast not given him warning , he shall die in his sin , and his righteous acts which he hath done shall not be remembered ; but his blood will I require at thy hand .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	21	And if thou warn the righteous [ man ] , that the righteous sin not , and he doth not sin , he shall certainly live , for he hath taken warning ; and thou hast delivered thy soul .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	22	And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me ; and he said unto me , Arise , go forth into the valley , and there I will talk with thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	23	And I arose , and went forth into the valley , and behold , the glory of Jehovah stood there , like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar ; and I fell on my face .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	24	And the Spirit entered into me , and set me upon my feet ; and he spoke with me , and said unto me , Go , shut thyself within thy house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	25	And thou , son of man , behold , they shall put bands upon thee , and shall bind thee therewith , and thou shalt not go out among them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	26	And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to them a reprover ; for they are a rebellious house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	3	27	And when I speak with thee , I will open thy mouth , and thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : He that heareth , let him hear ; and he that forbeareth , let him forbear : for they are a rebellious house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	4	4	And thou , lie upon thy left side , and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it : the number of the days that thou liest upon it , thou shalt bear their iniquity .
DARBY	Ezekiel	4	2	and lay siege against it , and build forts against it , and cast a mound against it , and set camps against it , and place battering-rams against it round about .
DARBY	Ezekiel	4	3	And take thou unto thee an iron plate , and put it [ for ] a wall of iron between thee and the city ; and set thy face against it , and it shall be besieged , and thou shalt lay siege against it : this shall be a sign to the house of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	4	5	And I have appointed thee the years of their iniquity , according to the number of the days , three hundred and ninety days ; and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	4	6	And when thou hast accomplished them , thou shalt lie again on thy right side , and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days : I have appointed thee each day for a year .
DARBY	Ezekiel	4	7	And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem , and thine arm shall be uncovered , and thou shalt prophesy against it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	4	8	And behold , I lay bands upon thee , and thou shalt not turn thyself from one side to the other , till thou hast ended the days of thy siege .
DARBY	Ezekiel	4	9	And thou , take unto thee wheat , and barley , and beans , and lentils , and millet , and spelt , and put them in one vessel , and make thee bread thereof , [ according to ] the number of the days that thou liest upon thy side : three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof .
DARBY	Ezekiel	4	10	And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight , twenty shekels a day : from time to time shalt thou eat it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	4	11	And thou shalt drink water by measure , the sixth part of a hin : from time to time shalt thou drink .
DARBY	Ezekiel	4	12	And thou shalt eat it [ as ] barley-cake , and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man .
DARBY	Ezekiel	4	13	And Jehovah said , So shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations whither I will drive them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	4	14	Then said I , Ah , Lord Jehovah ! behold , my soul hath not been defiled , and from my youth up even until now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself , or of that which is torn ; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth .
DARBY	Ezekiel	4	15	And he said unto me , See , I have given thee cow 's dung for man 's dung , and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith .
DARBY	Ezekiel	4	16	And he said unto me , Son of man , behold , I break the staff of bread in Jerusalem ; and they shall eat bread by weight , and with anxiety ; and they shall drink water by measure , and with astonishment :
DARBY	Ezekiel	4	17	because bread and water shall fail them , and they shall be astonied one with another , and waste away in their iniquity .
DARBY	Ezekiel	5	5	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : This is Jerusalem : I have set her in the midst of the nations , and the countries are round about her .
DARBY	Ezekiel	5	2	A third part shalt thou burn in the fire in the midst of the city , when the days of the siege are fulfilled ; and thou shalt take a third part , [ and ] smite about it with a knife ; and a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind , and I will draw out a sword after them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	5	3	And thou shalt take thereof a few in number , and bind them in thy skirts ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	5	4	and thou shalt take of these again , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire : from it shall a fire come forth against all the house of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	5	6	And she hath rebelled against my judgments in wickedness more than the nations , and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her : for mine ordinances have they refused ; and my statutes , they have not walked in them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	5	7	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because ye have been turbulent more than the nations that are round about you , [ and ] have not walked in my statutes , neither have kept mine ordinances , nor [ even ] have done according to the ordinances of the nations that are round about you ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	5	8	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I , even I , am against thee , and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	5	9	and I will do in thee that which I have not done , and whereunto I will not do any more the like , because of all thine abominations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	5	10	Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments in thee , and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter to all the winds .
DARBY	Ezekiel	5	11	Wherefore , [ as ] I live , saith the Lord Jehovah , verily because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things , and with all thine abominations , therefore will I also withdraw mine eye , and it shall not spare , nor will I have any pity .
DARBY	Ezekiel	5	12	A third part of thee shall die by the pestilence , and shall be consumed by the famine in the midst of thee ; and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee ; and I will scatter a third part to all the winds , and I will draw out a sword after them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	5	13	And mine anger shall be accomplished , and I will satisfy my fury upon them , and I will comfort myself ; and they shall know that I Jehovah have spoken in my jealousy , when I have accomplished my fury upon them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	5	14	And I will make thee a waste and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee , in the sight of all that pass by .
DARBY	Ezekiel	5	15	And it shall be a reproach , and a taunt , an instruction , and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee , when I shall execute judgments upon thee in anger , and in fury , and in furious rebukes : I , Jehovah , have spoken .
DARBY	Ezekiel	5	16	When I send upon them the evil arrows of famine , that are for [ their ] destruction , which I send to destroy you , then will I increase the famine upon you , and will break your staff of bread .
DARBY	Ezekiel	5	17	And I will send upon you famine and evil beasts , which shall bereave thee of children ; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee ; and I will bring the sword upon thee : I , Jehovah , have spoken .
DARBY	Ezekiel	6	6	In all your dwelling-places the cities shall be laid waste , and the high places shall be desolate ; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate , and your idols may be broken and cease , and your sun-images may be cut down , and your works may be abolished .
DARBY	Ezekiel	6	2	Son of man , set thy face toward the mountains of Israel , and prophesy against them ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	6	3	and say , Mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord Jehovah : thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills , to the water-courses and to the valleys : Behold , I , [ even ] I , do bring a sword upon you , and will destroy your high places .
DARBY	Ezekiel	6	4	And your altars shall be desolate , and your sun-images shall be broken ; and I will cast down your slain [ men ] before your idols ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	6	5	and I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols ; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars .
DARBY	Ezekiel	6	7	And the slain shall fall in the midst of you , and ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	6	8	Yet will I leave a remnant , in that ye shall have some escaped from the sword among the nations , when ye shall be scattered through the countries .
DARBY	Ezekiel	6	9	And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they have been carried captives , when I shall have broken their whorish heart , which hath departed from me , and their eyes , which go a whoring after their idols ; and they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed , in all their abominations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	6	10	And they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah : I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	6	11	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Smite with thy hand , and stamp with thy foot , and say , Alas for all the abominations of the iniquities of the house of Israel ! for they shall fall by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence .
DARBY	Ezekiel	6	12	He that is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he that is near shall fall by the sword ; and he that is left , and is besieged , shall die by the famine : and I will accomplish my fury upon them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	6	13	And ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah , when their slain shall be among their idols , round about their altars , upon every high hill , on all the tops of the mountains , and under every green tree , and under every thick terebinth , the places where they offered sweet savour to all their idols .
DARBY	Ezekiel	6	14	And I will stretch out my hand upon them , and make the land desolate , yea , more desolate than the wilderness of Diblath , in all their dwellings ; and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	7	The doom is come unto thee , inhabitant of the land ; the time is come , the day is near , —tumult , and not the joyous cry from the mountains .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	2	And thou , son of man , thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto the land of Israel : An end , the end is come upon the four corners of the land .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	3	Now is the end upon thee ; and I will send mine anger upon thee , and will judge thee according to thy ways , and will bring upon thee all thine abominations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	4	And mine eye shall not spare thee , neither will I have pity ; but I will bring thy ways upon thee , and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee ; and ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	5	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : An evil , an only evil ! behold , it is come .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	6	The end is come , the end is come ; it awaketh against thee : behold , it cometh .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	8	Now will I soon pour out my fury upon thee , and accomplish mine anger against thee ; and I will judge thee according to thy ways , and will bring upon thee all thine abominations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	9	And mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will render unto thee according to thy ways , and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee ; and ye shall know that it is I , Jehovah , that smite .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	10	Behold the day , behold , it is come : the doom is gone forth ; the rod hath blossomed , pride is full blown .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	11	Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness : nothing of them [ shall remain ] , nor of their multitude , nor of their wealth , nor of the magnificence in the midst of them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	12	The time is come , the day draweth near : let not the buyer rejoice , nor the seller mourn ; for fierce anger is upon all the multitude thereof .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	13	For the seller shall not return to that which is sold , even though he were yet alive amongst the living : for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof ; it shall not be revoked ; and none shall through his iniquity assure his life .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	14	They have blown the trumpet and made all ready , but none goeth to the battle ; for my fierce anger is upon all the multitude thereof .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	15	The sword is without , and the pestilence and the famine within : he that is in the field shall die by the sword ; and he that is in the city , famine and pestilence shall devour him .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	16	And they that escape of them shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys , all of them moaning , every one for his iniquity .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	17	All hands shall be feeble , and all knees shall melt into water .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	18	And they shall gird on sackcloth , and horror shall cover them ; and shame shall be upon all faces , and baldness upon all their heads .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	19	They shall cast their silver in the streets , and their gold shall be as an impurity : their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovah 's wrath ; they shall not satisfy their souls , neither fill their belly ; for it hath been the stumbling-block of their iniquity .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	20	And he set in majesty his beautiful ornament ; but they made therein the images of their abominations [ and ] of their detestable things : therefore have I made it an impurity unto them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	21	And I will give it into the hands of strangers for a prey , and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil ; and they shall profane it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	22	And I will turn my face from them ; and they shall profane my secret [ place ] ; and the violent shall enter into it , and profane it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	23	Make the chain ; for the land is full of bloody crimes , and the city is full of violence .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	24	Therefore will I bring the worst of the nations , and they shall possess their houses ; and I will make the pride of the strong to cease ; and their sanctuaries shall be profaned .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	25	Destruction cometh ; and they shall seek peace , but there shall be none .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	26	Mischief shall come upon mischief , and rumour shall be upon rumour ; and they shall seek a vision from a prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the elders .
DARBY	Ezekiel	7	27	The king shall mourn , and the prince shall be clothed with dismay , and the hands of the people of the land shall tremble : I will do unto them according to their way , and with their judgments will I judge them ; and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	8	And he said unto me , Son of man , dig now through the wall ; and I digged through the wall , and behold , a door .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	2	And I looked , and behold , a likeness as the appearance of fire ; from the appearance of his loins and downward , fire ; and from his loins and upward , as the appearance of brightness , as the look of glowing brass .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	3	And he stretched forth the form of a hand , and took me by a lock of my head ; and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heavens , and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem , to the entry of the inner gate that looketh toward the north , where was the seat of the image of jealousy , which provoketh to jealousy .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	4	And behold , the glory of the God of Israel was there , according to the appearance that I saw in the valley .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	5	And he said unto me , Son of man , lift up now thine eyes toward the north . And I lifted up mine eyes toward the north , and behold , northward of the gate of the altar , this image of jealousy in the entry .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	6	And he said unto me , Son of man , seest thou what they do ? the great abominations that the house of Israel commit here , to cause [ me ] to go far off from my sanctuary ? And yet again thou shalt see great abominations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	7	And he brought me to the entry of the court , and I looked , and behold , a hole in the wall .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	9	And he said unto me , Go in , and behold the wicked abominations that they do here .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	10	And I went in and looked , and behold , every form of creeping thing and abominable beast , and all the idols of the house of Israel , portrayed upon the wall round about .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	11	And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel , and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan , with every man his censer in his hand ; and a thick cloud of incense went up .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	12	And he said unto me , Hast thou seen , son of man , what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark , every one in his chambers of imagery ? for they say , Jehovah seeth us not ; Jehovah hath forsaken the land .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	13	And he said unto me , Yet again thou shalt see great abominations which they do .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	14	And he brought me to the entry of the gate of Jehovah 's house that was toward the north ; and behold , there sat women weeping for Tammuz .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	15	And he said unto me , Seest thou , son of man ? Thou shalt yet again see greater abominations than these .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	16	And he brought me into the inner court of Jehovah 's house , and behold , at the entry of the temple of Jehovah , between the porch and the altar , were about five and twenty men , with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah and their faces toward the east ; and they worshipped the sun toward the east .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	17	And he said unto me , Seest thou , son of man ? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here , that they yet fill the land with violence , and keep provoking me afresh to anger ? And behold , they put the branch to their nose .
DARBY	Ezekiel	8	18	And I also will deal in fury : mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity ; and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice , I will not hear them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	9	9	And he said unto me , The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great , and the land is full of blood , and the city full of perverseness ; for they say , Jehovah hath forsaken the earth , and Jehovah seeth not .
DARBY	Ezekiel	9	2	And behold , six men came from the way of the upper gate , which is turned toward the north , and every man [ with ] his slaughter weapon in his hand ; and in the midst of them , one man clothed with linen , with a writer 's ink-horn by his side ; and they went in , and stood beside the brazen altar .
DARBY	Ezekiel	9	3	And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub , whereupon it was , to the threshold of the house ; and he called to the man clothed with linen , who had the writer 's ink-horn by his side ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	9	4	and Jehovah said unto him , Go through the midst of the city , through the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof .
DARBY	Ezekiel	9	5	And to the others he said in my hearing , Go after him through the city , and smite : let not your eye spare , neither have pity .
DARBY	Ezekiel	9	6	Slay utterly the old man , the young man , and the maiden , and little children , and women ; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark ; and begin at my sanctuary . Then they began at the elders who were before the house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	9	7	And he said unto them , Defile the house , and fill the courts with the slain : go forth . And they went forth , and smote in the city .
DARBY	Ezekiel	9	8	And it came to pass , while they were smiting , and I was left , that I fell upon my face , and cried , and said , Ah , Lord Jehovah ! wilt thou destroy all the remnant of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	9	10	And as for me also , mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will recompense their way upon their head .
DARBY	Ezekiel	9	11	And behold , the man clothed with linen , who had the ink-horn by his side , reported the matter , saying , I have done as thou hast commanded me .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	10	And as for their appearance , they four had one likeness , as if a wheel were in the midst of a wheel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	2	And he spoke unto the man clothed with linen , and said , Come in between the wheels , under the cherub , and fill the hollow of thy hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim , and scatter them over the city . And he went in in my sight .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	3	And the cherubim stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in ; and the cloud filled the inner court .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	4	And the glory of Jehovah mounted up from the cherub , [ and came ] over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full of the brightness of Jehovah 's glory .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	5	And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard to the outer court , as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	6	And it came to pass when he had commanded the man clothed with linen , saying , Take fire from between the wheels , from between the cherubim , then he went in , and stood beside the wheel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	7	And the cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim , and took and put it into the hands of him [ that was ] clothed with linen ; who took [ it ] , and went out .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	8	And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man 's hand under their wings .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	9	And I looked , and behold , four wheels beside the cherubim , one wheel beside one cherub , and another wheel beside another cherub ; and the appearance of the wheels was as the look of a chrysolite stone .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	11	When they went , they went upon their four sides ; they turned not as they went , but to the place whither the head looked they followed it : they turned not as they went .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	12	And their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their wings , and the wheels were full of eyes round about , in them four [ and ] their wheels .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	13	As for the wheels , they were called in my hearing , Galgal .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	14	And every one had four faces : the first face was the face of a cherub , and the second face the face of a man , and the third the face of a lion , and the fourth the face of an eagle .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	15	And the cherubim mounted up . This was the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	16	And when the cherubim went , the wheels went beside them ; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth , the same wheels also turned not from beside them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	17	When they stood , these stood ; and when they mounted up , these mounted up with them : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	18	And the glory of Jehovah departed from over the threshold of the house , and stood over the cherubim .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	19	And the cherubim lifted up their wings , and mounted up from the earth in my sight , when they went out ; and the wheels were beside them ; and they stood at the door of the east gate of Jehovah 's house ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	20	This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar ; and I knew that they were cherubim .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	21	Each one had four faces , and every one four wings ; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings .
DARBY	Ezekiel	10	22	And as for the likeness of their faces , they were the faces which I had seen by the river Chebar—their appearance and themselves : they went every one straight before them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	11	This shall not be your cauldron , neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst of it : I will judge you in the borders of Israel ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	2	And he said unto me , Son of man , these are the men that devise iniquity , and give wicked counsel in this city :
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	3	who say , It is not the time to build houses : this is the cauldron , and we are the flesh .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	4	Therefore prophesy against them , prophesy , son of man .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	5	And the Spirit of Jehovah fell on me , and said unto me , Speak , Thus saith Jehovah : Thus have ye said , O house of Israel ; and the things that come into your mind , I know them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	6	Ye have multiplied your slain in this city , and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	7	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it , they are the flesh , and it is the cauldron ; but you will I bring forth out of the midst of it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	8	Ye have feared the sword , and I will bring a sword upon you , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	9	And I will bring you out of the midst of it , and give you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	10	Ye shall fall by the sword ; I will judge you in the borders of Israel ; and ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	12	and ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah , in whose statutes ye have not walked , neither have done mine ordinances , but have done after the ordinances of the nations that are round about you .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	13	And it came to pass , when I prophesied , that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died . And I fell down on my face , and cried with a loud voice , and said , Ah , Lord Jehovah ! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	14	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	15	Son of man , [ it is ] thy brethren , thy brethren , the men of thy kindred , and all the house of Israel , the whole of it , unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem say , Get you far from Jehovah : unto us is this land given for a possession .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	16	Therefore say , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Although I have removed them far off among the nations , and although I have scattered them among the countries , yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries whither they are come .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	17	Therefore say , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : I will even gather you from the peoples , and assemble you out of the countries where ye are scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	18	And they shall come thither , and they shall take away from thence all its detestable things and all its abominations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	19	And I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take away the stony heart out of their flesh , and will give them a heart of flesh ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	20	that they may walk in my statutes , and keep mine ordinances , and do them ; and they shall be my people , and I will be their God .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	21	But as for them whose heart walketh well-pleased with their detestable things and their abominations , I will recompense their way upon their heads , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	22	And the cherubim lifted up their wings , and the wheels were beside them ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	23	And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city , and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	24	And the Spirit lifted me up , and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea , to them of the captivity ; and the vision that I had seen went up from me .
DARBY	Ezekiel	11	25	And I spoke unto them of the captivity all the things that Jehovah had shewn me .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	12	And the prince that is among them shall bear upon [ his ] shoulder in the dark , and shall go forth ; they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby ; he shall cover his face , that he see not the land with [ his ] eyes .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	2	Son of man , thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house , which have eyes to see , and see not , which have ears to hear , and hear not ; for they are a rebellious house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	3	And thou , son of man , prepare thee a captive 's baggage , and go captive by day in their sight ; and thou shalt go captive from thy place to another place in their sight . It may be they will consider , though they are a rebellious house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	4	And bring forth thy baggage by day in their sight , as a captive 's baggage , and thou thyself , go forth at even in their sight as they that go forth into captivity .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	5	Dig thou through the wall in their sight , and carry out thereby .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	6	In their sight shalt thou bear [ it ] upon [ thy ] shoulder , and carry it forth in the dark ; thou shalt cover thy face , and thou shalt not see the ground : for I have appointed thee for a sign unto the house of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	7	And I did so as I was commanded : I brought forth my baggage by day , as a captive 's baggage , and in the even I digged through the wall with my hand ; I brought it forth in the dark , [ and ] bore it upon [ my ] shoulder , in their sight .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	8	And in the morning the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	9	Son of man , hath not the house of Israel , the rebellious house , said unto thee , What doest thou ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	10	Say unto them , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : This burden [ concerneth ] the prince in Jerusalem , and all the house of Israel that are among them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	11	Say , I am your sign : as I have done , so shall it be done unto them : they shall go into exile , into captivity .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	13	And I will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare ; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans ; but he shall not see it , and there shall he die .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	14	And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him , and all his troops ; and I will draw out the sword after them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	15	And they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah when I shall scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	16	But I will leave a few men of them from the sword , from the famine , and from the pestilence ; that they may declare all their abominations among the nations whither they shall come ; and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	17	And the word of Jehovah came to me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	18	Son of man , eat thy bread with quaking , and drink thy water with trembling and with anxiety ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	19	and say unto the people of the land , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem , in the land of Israel : They shall eat their bread with anxiety , and drink their water with astonishment , because her land shall be left desolate of all that is in it , for the violence of all them that dwell therein .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	20	And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste , and the land shall be a desolation ; and ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	21	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	22	Son of man , what is that proverb which ye have in the land of Israel , saying , The days shall be prolonged , and every vision faileth ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	23	Tell them therefore , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : I will make this proverb to cease , and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel ; but say unto them , The days are at hand , and the accomplishment of every vision .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	24	For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination in the midst of the house of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	25	For I [ am ] Jehovah ; I will speak , and the word that I shall speak shall be performed , it shall be no more deferred . For in your days , O rebellious house , will I speak the word and will perform it , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	26	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	27	Son of man , behold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he seeth is for many days , and he prophesieth of times that are far off .
DARBY	Ezekiel	12	28	Therefore say unto them , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : There shall none of my words be deferred any more , but the word that I have spoken shall be done , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	13	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : I will cause to burst forth a stormy wind in my fury ; and there shall be an overflowing rain in mine anger , and hail-stones in fury for utter destruction .
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	2	Son of man , prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy , and say unto them that prophesy out of their own heart , Hear ye the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	3	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Woe unto the foolish prophets , that follow their own spirit , and have seen nothing !
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	4	O Israel , thy prophets have been like foxes in desert places .
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	5	Ye have not gone up into the breaches , nor made up the fence for the house of Israel , to stand in the battle in the day of Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	6	They have seen vanity and lying divination , that say , Jehovah saith ! and Jehovah hath not sent them ; and they make [ them ] to hope that the word will be fulfilled .
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	7	Have ye not seen a vain vision , and spoken a lying divination , when ye say , Jehovah saith ; and I have not spoken ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	8	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because ye speak vanity , and have seen lies , therefore behold , I am against you , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	9	And my hand shall be against the prophets that see vanity and that divine lies : they shall not be in the council of my people , neither shall they be written in the register of the house of Israel , and they shall not enter into the land of Israel : and ye shall know that I [ am ] the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	10	Because , yea because they have seduced my people , saying , Peace ! and there is no peace ; and one buildeth up a wall , and lo , they daub it with untempered [ mortar ] —
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	11	say unto them which daub it with untempered [ mortar ] that it shall fall : there shall be an overflowing rain , and ye , O great hailstones , shall fall , and a stormy wind shall burst forth .
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	12	And lo , when the wall is fallen , shall it not be said unto you , Where is the daubing with which ye have daubed [ it ] ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	14	And I will break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered [ mortar ] , and bring it down to the ground , so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered ; and it shall fall , and ye shall be destroyed in the midst thereof ; and ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	15	And I will accomplish my fury upon the wall , and upon them that daub it with untempered [ mortar ] , and will say unto you , The wall is no [ more ] , neither they that daubed it ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	16	the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem , and who see a vision of peace for her , and there is no peace , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	17	And thou , son of man , set thy face against the daughters of thy people , who prophesy out of their own heart ; and prophesy against them ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	18	and say , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Woe unto the women that sew pillows for all wrists , and that make veils for the head [ of persons ] of every stature to catch souls ! Will ye catch the souls of my people , and will ye save your own souls alive ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	19	And will ye profane me among my people for handfuls of barley and for morsels of bread , to slay the souls that should not die , and to save the souls alive that should not live , by your lying to my people that listen to lying ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	20	Wherefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I am against your pillows , that the souls which ye catch by their means may fly away ; and I will tear them from your arms , and will let the souls go , the souls that ye catch , that they may fly away .
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	21	And I will tear your veils and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted ; and ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	22	Because with falsehood ye have grieved the heart of the righteous , whom I have not made sad ; and have strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , to save his life :
DARBY	Ezekiel	13	23	therefore ye shall no more see vanity , nor divine divinations ; and I will deliver my people out of your hand : and ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	14	though these three men , Noah , Daniel , and Job , should be in it , they should deliver [ but ] their own souls by their righteousness , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	2	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	3	Son of man , these men have set up their idols in their heart , and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face : should I be inquired of at all by them ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	4	Therefore speak to them , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Every man of the house of Israel that setteth up his idols in his heart , and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face , and cometh to the prophet , I Jehovah will answer him according to this , according to the multitude of his idols :
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	5	that I may take the house of Israel by their own heart , because they are all estranged from me through their idols .
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	6	Therefore say unto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Return ye , and turn yourselves from your idols ; and turn away your faces from all your abominations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	7	For every one of the house of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel , who separateth himself from me , and setteth up his idols in his heart , and putteth the stumbling-block of his iniquity before his face , and cometh to the prophet to inquire of me by him , I Jehovah will answer him by myself ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	8	and I will set my face against that man , and will make him desolate , [ so that he shall be ] for a sign and for proverbs , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people : and ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	9	And if the prophet be enticed and shall speak a word , I Jehovah have enticed that prophet ; and I will stretch out my hand against him , and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	10	And they shall bear their iniquity : the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of the inquirer ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	11	that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me , neither make themselves any more unclean with all their transgressions ; and they shall be my people , and I will be their God , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	12	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	13	Son of man , when a land sinneth against me by working unfaithfulness , and I stretch out my hand upon it , and break the staff of the bread thereof , and send famine upon it , and cut off man and beast from it ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	15	If I cause evil beasts to pass through the land , and they bereave it , and it become a desolation , so that no one passeth through because of the beasts ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	16	—though these three men should be in it , [ as ] I live , saith the Lord Jehovah , they should deliver neither sons nor daughters : they only should be delivered , and the land should be a desolation .
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	17	Or [ if ] I bring the sword upon that land , and say , Sword , go through the land , so that I cut off man and beast from it ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	18	and these three men should be in it , [ as ] I live , saith the Lord Jehovah , they should deliver neither sons nor daughters , but they only themselves should be delivered .
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	19	Or [ if ] I send a pestilence into that land , and pour out my fury upon it in blood , to cut off from it man and beast ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	20	and Noah , Daniel , and Job should be in it , [ as ] I live , saith the Lord Jehovah , they should deliver neither son nor daughter : they should [ but ] deliver their own souls by their righteousness .
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	21	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah : How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem , the sword , and the famine , and the evil beast , and the pestilence , to cut off from it man and beast !
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	22	But behold , there shall be left in it those that escape , who shall be brought out of [ it ] , sons and daughters . Behold , they shall come forth unto you , and ye shall see their way and their doings ; and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem , as to all that I have brought upon it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	14	23	And they shall comfort you , when ye see their way and their doings ; and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	15	15	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	15	2	Son of man , what is the wood of the vine more than any wood , the vine-branch , which is among the trees of the forest ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	15	3	Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work ? or will [ men ] take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	15	4	Behold , it is given to the fire for fuel : the fire consumeth both the ends of it , and the midst of it is burned ; is it fit for [ any ] work ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	15	5	Behold , when it was whole , it was used for no work ; how much less when the fire hath consumed it , and it is burned , should it yet be used for any work ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	15	6	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest , which I have given to the fire for fuel , so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Ezekiel	15	7	And I will set my face against them : they shall go forth from [ one ] fire , and [ another ] fire shall devour them ; and ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah when I set my face against them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	15	8	And I will make the land a desolation , because they have wrought unfaithfulness , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	16	And of thy garments thou didst take , and madest for thyself high places decked with divers colours , and didst play the harlot thereupon : [ the like ] hath not come to pass , and shall be no more .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	2	Son of man , cause Jerusalem to know her abominations ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	3	and say , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto Jerusalem : Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of the Canaanite : thy father was an Amorite , and thy mother a Hittite .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	4	And as for thy nativity , in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut , neither wast thou washed in water for cleansing ; thou wast not rubbed with salt at all , nor swaddled at all .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	5	No eye pitied thee , to do any of these unto thee , to have compassion upon thee ; but thou wast cast out in the open field , from abhorrence of thy person , in the day that thou wast born .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	6	And I passed by thee , and saw thee weltering in thy blood , and I said unto thee , in thy blood , Live ! yea , I said unto thee , in thy blood , Live !
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	7	I caused thee to multiply , as the bud of the field ; and thou didst increase and grow great , and thou camest to fulness of beauty ; [ thy ] breasts were fashioned , and thy hair grew : but thou wast naked and bare .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	8	And I passed by thee , and looked upon thee , and behold , thy time was the time of love ; and I spread my skirt over thee , and covered thy nakedness ; and I swore unto thee , and entered into a covenant with thee , saith the Lord Jehovah , and thou becamest mine .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	9	And I washed thee with water , and thoroughly washed away thy blood from thee , and I anointed thee with oil ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	10	and I clothed thee with embroidered work , and shod thee with badgers ' skin , and I bound thee about with byssus , and covered thee with silk .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	11	And I decked thee with ornaments , and I put bracelets upon thy hands , and a chain on thy neck ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	12	and I put a ring on thy nose , and earrings in thine ears , and a beautiful crown upon thy head .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	13	Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver , and thy raiment was byssus , and silk , and embroidered work . Thou didst eat fine flour , and honey , and oil ; and thou becamest exceedingly beautiful , and thou didst prosper into a kingdom .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	14	And thy fame went forth among the nations for thy beauty ; for it was perfect through my magnificence , which I had put upon thee , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	15	But thou didst confide in thy beauty , and playedst the harlot because of thy renown , and pouredst out thy whoredoms on every one that passed by : his it was .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	17	And thou didst take thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver , which I had given thee , and madest to thyself images of males , and didst commit fornication with them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	18	And thou tookest thine embroidered garments , and coveredst them ; and thou didst set mine oil and mine incense before them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	19	And my bread which I had given thee , the fine flour and the oil and the honey wherewith I fed thee , thou didst even set it before them for a sweet savour : thus it was , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	20	And thou didst take thy sons and thy daughters , whom thou hadst borne unto me , and these didst thou sacrifice unto them , to be devoured . Were thy whoredoms a small matter ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	21	that thou didst slay my children and give them up in passing them over to them ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	22	And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth , when thou wast naked and bare , when thou wast weltering in thy blood .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	23	And it came to pass after all thy wickedness ( woe , woe unto thee ! saith the Lord Jehovah ) ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	24	that thou didst also build unto thee a place of debauchery , and didst make thee a high place in every street :
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	25	thou didst build thy high place at every head of the way , and madest thy beauty to be abhorred , and thou didst open thy feet to every one that passed by , and multiply thy whoredom .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	26	And thou didst commit fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours , great of flesh ; and didst multiply thy whoredom to provoke me to anger .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	27	And behold , I stretched out my hand over thee , and diminished thine appointed portion ; and I gave thee over unto the will of them that hate thee , the daughters of the Philistines , who were confounded at thy lewd way .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	28	And thou didst commit fornication with the Assyrians , because thou wast insatiable ; yea , thou didst commit fornication with them , and yet couldest not be satisfied .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	29	And thou didst multiply thy whoredom with the land of merchants , Chaldea , and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	30	How weak is thy heart , saith the Lord Jehovah , seeing thou doest all these [ things ] , the work of a whorish woman , under no restraint ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	31	in that thou buildest thy place of debauchery at the head of every way , and makest thy high place in every street ! And thou hast not been as a harlot , in that thou scornest reward ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	32	O adulterous wife , that taketh strangers instead of her husband .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	33	They give rewards to all harlots ; but thou gavest thy rewards to all thy lovers , and rewardedst them , that they might come unto thee on every side for thy whoredoms .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	34	And in thee is the contrary from [ other ] women , in thy whoredoms , in that none followeth thee to commit fornication ; and whereas thou givest a reward , and no reward is given unto thee , so art thou contrary .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	35	Therefore , O harlot , hear the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	36	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because thy money hath been poured out , and thy nakedness discovered through thy fornications with thy lovers , and with all the idols of thine abominations , and because of the blood of thy children which thou didst give unto them ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	37	therefore , behold , I will gather all thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure , and all that thou hast loved , with all that thou hast hated , —I will even gather them round about against thee , and will discover thy nakedness unto them , that they may see all thy nakedness .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	38	And I will judge thee with the judgments of women that commit adultery and shed blood ; and I will give thee up to the blood of fury and jealousy ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	39	and I will give thee into their hand , and they shall throw down thy place of debauchery , and shall break down thy high places ; and they shall strip thee of thy garments , and shall take thy fair jewels , and leave thee naked and bare .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	40	And they shall bring up an assemblage against thee , and they shall stone thee with stones , and thrust thee through with their swords .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	41	And they shall burn thy houses with fire , and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women ; and I will cause thee to cease from being a harlot , and thou also shalt give no more any reward .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	42	And I will appease my fury against thee , and my jealousy shall depart from thee ; and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	43	Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth , but hast raged against me in all these [ things ] , behold , therefore , I also will recompense thy way upon [ thy ] head , saith the Lord Jehovah , and thou shalt not commit this lewdness besides all thine abominations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	44	Behold , every one that useth proverbs shall speak in a proverb against thee , saying , As the mother , [ so is ] her daughter !
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	45	Thou art the daughter of thy mother that loathed her husband and her children ; and thou art the sister of thy sisters , who loathed their husbands and their children . Your mother was a Hittite , and your father an Amorite .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	46	And thine elder sister is Samaria that dwelleth at thy left hand , she and her daughters ; and thy younger sister , that dwelleth at thy right hand , is Sodom and her daughters .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	47	And thou hast not walked in their ways , nor done according to their abominations ; but as though that were a very little , thou hast been more corrupt than they in all thy ways .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	48	[ As ] I live , saith the Lord Jehovah , Sodom thy sister hath not done , she nor her daughters , as thou hast done , thou and thy daughters !
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	49	Behold , this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom : pride , fulness of bread , and careless ease was in her and in her daughters , but she did not strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	50	And they were haughty , and committed abomination before me , and I took them away when I saw [ it ] .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	51	And Samaria hath not sinned according to the half of thy sins ; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they , and hast justified thy sisters by all thine abominations which thou hast done .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	52	Thou also , who hast judged thy sisters , bear thine own confusion , because of thy sins in which thou hast acted more abominably than they : they are more righteous than thou . So be thou ashamed also , and bear thy confusion , in that thou hast justified thy sisters .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	53	And I will bring again their captivity , the captivity of Sodom and her daughters , and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters , and the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	54	that thou mayest bear thy confusion , and mayest be confounded for all that thou hast done , in that thou comfortest them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	55	And thy sisters , Sodom and her daughters , shall return to their former estate , and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate ; thou also and thy daughters , ye shall return to your former estate .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	56	Yea , Sodom thy sister was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	57	before thy wickedness was discovered , as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria , and of all that are round about her , the daughters of the Philistines , who despise thee on every side .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	58	Thy lewdness and thine abominations , thou bearest them , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	59	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah : I will even deal with thee as thou hast done , who hast despised the oath , and broken the covenant .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	60	Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth , and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	61	And thou shalt remember thy ways , and be confounded , when thou shalt receive thy sisters who are older than thou , together with those who are younger than thou ; for I will give them unto thee for daughters , but not by virtue of thy covenant .
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	62	And I will establish my covenant with thee , and thou shalt know that I [ am ] Jehovah ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	16	63	that thou mayest remember , and be ashamed , and no more open thy mouth because of thy confusion , when I forgive thee all that thou hast done , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	17	Neither shall Pharaoh with a mighty army and a great assemblage do anything for him in the war , when they cast up mounds and build forts to cut off many persons .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	2	Son of man , put forth a riddle , and speak a parable unto the house of Israel ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	3	and say , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : A great eagle with great wings , long-pinioned , full of feathers , which was of divers colours , came unto Lebanon , and took the highest branch of the cedar .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	4	He cropped off the top of its young shoots , and carried it into a merchants ' land ; he set it in a city of traders .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	5	And he took of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful field ; he placed it by great waters , he set it as a willow tree .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	6	And it grew , and became a spreading vine of low stature , so that its branches should turn toward him , and the roots thereof be under him ; and it became a vine , and brought forth branches , and shot forth sprigs .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	7	And there was another great eagle with great wings and many feathers ; and behold , from the beds of her plantation , this vine did bend her roots unto him , and shot forth her branches toward him , that he might water it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	8	It was planted in a good field by many waters , that it might bring forth branches and bear fruit , that it might be a noble vine .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	9	Say , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Shall it prosper ? Shall he not pull up its roots , and cut off its fruit , that it may wither ? All its fresh sprouting leaves shall wither , even without a great arm and many people to pluck it up by its roots .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	10	And behold , being planted , shall it prosper ? shall it not utterly wither when the east wind toucheth it ? It shall wither in the beds where it grew .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	11	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	12	Say now to the rebellious house , Know ye not what these things are ? Say , Behold , the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem , and took its king and its princes , and led them with him to Babylon .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	13	And he took of the king 's seed , and made a covenant with him , and brought him under an oath , and he took away the mighty of the land ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	14	that the kingdom might be abased , that it might not lift itself up , that it might keep his covenant in order to stand .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	15	But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt , that they might give him horses and much people . Shall he prosper ? shall he escape that doeth such things ? shall he break the covenant , and yet escape ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	16	[ As ] I live , saith the Lord Jehovah , verily in the place of the king that made him king , whose oath he despised , and whose covenant he broke , even with him , in the midst of Babylon , shall he die .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	18	He despised the oath , and broke the covenant ; and behold , he had given his hand , yet hath he done all these things : he shall not escape .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	19	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : [ As ] I live , verily , mine oath which he hath despised , and my covenant which he hath broken , even it will I recompense upon his head .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	20	And I will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my snare ; and I will bring him to Babylon , and will enter into judgment with him there for his unfaithfulness in which he hath been unfaithful against me .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	21	And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword , and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind ; and ye shall know that I Jehovah have spoken .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	22	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : I will also take of the highest branch of the lofty cedar , and will set it ; I will crop off from the top of its young shoots a tender one , and I will plant it upon a high and eminent mountain :
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	23	upon the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it ; and it shall bring forth branches , and bear fruit , and become a noble cedar ; and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing ; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell .
DARBY	Ezekiel	17	24	And all the trees of the field shall know that I Jehovah have brought down the high tree , have exalted the low tree , have dried up the green tree , and made the dry tree to flourish : I Jehovah have spoken , and will do [ it ] .
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	18	As for his father , because he practised oppression , exercised robbery upon his brother , and did what was not good among his people , behold , he shall die in his iniquity .
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	2	What mean ye , ye who use this proverb of the land of Israel , saying , [ The ] fathers eat sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	3	[ As ] I live , saith the Lord Jehovah , ye shall not have any more to use this proverb in Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	4	Behold , all the souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul that sinneth , it shall die .
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	5	And if a man be righteous , and do judgment and justice :
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	6	—he hath not eaten upon the mountains , nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither hath defiled his neighbour 's wife , nor come near to a woman in her separation ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	7	and hath not oppressed any ; he hath restored to the debtor his pledge , hath not exercised robbery , hath given his bread to the hungry , and covered the naked with a garment ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	8	he hath not given forth upon usury , nor taken increase ; he hath withdrawn his hand from unrighteousness , hath executed true judgment between man and man ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	9	hath walked in my statutes , and kept mine ordinances , to deal faithfully : he is righteous , he shall certainly live , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	10	And if he have begotten a son that is violent , a shedder of blood , and that doeth only one of any of these [ things ] ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	11	and that doeth not any of those [ duties ] , but also hath eaten upon the mountains , and defiled his neighbour 's wife ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	12	hath oppressed the poor and needy , exercised robbery , hath not restored the pledge , and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols , committed abomination ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	13	given forth upon usury , and taken increase ; shall he then live ? He shall not live : he hath done all these abominations ; he shall certainly die ; his blood shall be upon him .
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	14	But lo , if he have begotten a son that seeth all his father 's sins which he hath done , and considereth , and doeth not such like :
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	15	—he hath not eaten upon the mountains , nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel ; he hath not defiled his neighbour 's wife ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	16	and hath not oppressed any , nor withholden the pledge , neither hath exercised robbery ; he hath given his bread to the hungry , and covered the naked with a garment ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	17	he hath withdrawn his hand from the poor , hath not received usury nor increase , hath executed my judgments , [ and ] walked in my statutes : he shall not die for the iniquity of his father , he shall certainly live .
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	19	And ye say , Why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father ? But the son hath done judgment and justice , hath kept all my statutes , and hath done them ; he shall certainly live .
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	20	The soul that sinneth , it shall die . The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father , neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son ; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him , and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him .
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	21	And the wicked , if he turn from all his sins which he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do judgment and justice , he shall certainly live , he shall not die .
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	22	None of his transgressions which he hath committed shall be remembered against him ; in his righteousness which he hath done shall he live .
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	23	Have I any pleasure at all in the death of the wicked ? saith the Lord Jehovah ; is it not in his turning from his way , that he may live ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	24	And when the righteous turneth from his righteousness and practiseth what is wrong , [ and ] doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked doeth , shall he live ? None of his righteous acts which he hath done shall be remembered : in his unfaithfulness which he hath wrought , and in his sin which he hath sinned , in them shall he die .
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	25	And ye say , The way of the Lord is not equal . Hear then , house of Israel . Is not my way equal ? are not your ways unequal ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	26	When the righteous turneth away from his righteousness , and practiseth what is wrong , and dieth for it ; in his wrong that he hath done shall he die .
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	27	And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness which he hath committed , and doeth judgment and justice , he shall keep his soul alive .
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	28	Because he considereth , and turneth from all his transgressions which he hath committed , he shall certainly live , he shall not die .
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	29	But the house of Israel say , The way of the Lord is not equal . O house of Israel , are not my ways equal ? Is it not your ways that are unequal ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	30	Therefore I will judge you , house of Israel , every one according to his ways , saith the Lord Jehovah . Return ye , and turn from all your transgressions ; so iniquity shall not be your snare .
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	31	Cast away from you all your transgressions wherewith ye have transgressed , and make you a new heart and a new spirit : why then will ye die , house of Israel ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	18	32	For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth , saith the Lord Jehovah ; therefore turn ye and live .
DARBY	Ezekiel	19	19	And thou , take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	19	2	and say , What was thy mother ? A lioness : she lay down among lions , she nourished her whelps in the midst of the young lions .
DARBY	Ezekiel	19	3	And she brought up one of her whelps ; it became a young lion , and he learned to catch the prey ; he devoured men .
DARBY	Ezekiel	19	4	And the nations heard of him ; he was taken in their pit , and they brought him with nose-rings into the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Ezekiel	19	5	And when she saw that she had waited [ and ] her hope was lost , she took another of her whelps , [ and ] made him a young lion .
DARBY	Ezekiel	19	6	And he went up and down among the lions ; he became a young lion , and learned to catch the prey ; he devoured men .
DARBY	Ezekiel	19	7	And he knew their [ desolate ] palaces , and he laid waste their cities , so that the land was desolate , and all it contained , by the noise of his roaring .
DARBY	Ezekiel	19	8	Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces , and spread their net over him ; he was taken in their pit .
DARBY	Ezekiel	19	9	And they put him in a cage with nose-rings , and brought him to the king of Babylon ; they brought him into strongholds , that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	19	10	Thy mother was as a vine , in thy rest , planted by the waters : it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
DARBY	Ezekiel	19	11	And it had strong rods for sceptres of them that bear rule , and its stature was exalted between the thick boughs ; and it was conspicuous by its height with the multitude of its branches .
DARBY	Ezekiel	19	12	But it was plucked up in fury , it was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up its fruit ; its strong rods were broken and withered ; the fire consumed them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	19	13	And now it is planted in the wilderness , in a dry and thirsty ground :
DARBY	Ezekiel	19	14	and a fire is gone out of a rod of its branches , [ which ] hath devoured its fruit ; so that it hath no strong rod to be a sceptre for ruling . This is a lamentation , and shall be for a lamentation .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	20	and hallow my sabbaths ; and they shall be a sign between me and you , that ye may know that I [ am ] Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	2	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	3	Son of man , speak unto the elders of Israel , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Are ye come to inquire of me ? [ As ] I live , saith the Lord Jehovah , I will not be inquired of by you .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	4	Wilt thou judge them , wilt thou judge , son of man ? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	5	and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : In the day when I chose Israel , and lifted up my hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob , and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt , when I lifted up my hand unto them , saying , I [ am ] Jehovah your God ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	6	in that day I lifted up my hand unto them , to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the ornament of all lands ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	7	and I said unto them , Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes , and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt : I [ am ] Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	8	But they rebelled against me , and would not hearken unto me : none of them cast away the abominations of his eyes , neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt . Then I thought to pour out my fury upon them , so as to accomplish mine anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	9	But I wrought for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they were , in whose sight I had made myself known unto them in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	10	And I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt , and brought them into the wilderness .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	11	And I gave them my statutes , and made known unto them mine ordinances , which if a man do , he shall live by them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	12	And I also gave them my sabbaths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that I [ am ] Jehovah that hallow them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	13	But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness : they walked not in my statutes , and they rejected mine ordinances , which if a man do , he shall live by them ; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned : and I said I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness , to consume them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	14	But I wrought for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I had brought them out .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	15	And I also lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness , that I would not bring them into the land that I had given [ them ] , flowing with milk and honey , which is the ornament of all lands ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	16	because they rejected mine ordinances and walked not in my statutes , and profaned my sabbaths : for their heart went after their idols .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	17	But mine eye spared them so as not to destroy them , neither did I make a full end of them in the wilderness .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	18	And I said unto their children in the wilderness , Walk not in the statutes of your fathers , neither keep their ordinances , nor defile yourselves with their idols .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	19	I [ am ] Jehovah your God : walk in my statutes , and keep mine ordinances , and do them ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	21	And the children rebelled against me : they walked not in my statutes , neither kept mine ordinances to do them , which if a man do , he shall live by them ; they profaned my sabbaths : and I said I would pour out my fury upon them , to accomplish mine anger against them in the wilderness .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	22	But I withdrew my hand , and wrought for my name 's sake , that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I had brought them out .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	23	I lifted up my hand also unto them in the wilderness , that I would scatter them among the nations , and disperse them through the countries ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	24	because they performed not mine ordinances , and rejected my statutes , and profaned my sabbaths , and their eyes were after their fathers ' idols .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	25	And I also gave them statutes that were not good , and ordinances whereby they should not live ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	26	and I defiled them by their own gifts , in that they devoted all that opened the womb , that I might make them desolate , to the end that they might know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	27	Therefore , son of man , speak unto the house of Israel , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : In this moreover have your fathers blasphemed me , in that they have wrought unfaithfulness against me .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	28	When I had brought them into the land which I had lifted up my hand to give unto them , then they saw every high hill and all the thick trees , and they offered there their sacrifices , and there they presented the provocation of their offering ; and there they placed their sweet savour , and there poured out their drink-offerings .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	29	And I said unto them , What is the high place whither ye go ? And the name thereof is called Bamah unto this day .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	30	Therefore say unto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Do ye defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers ? and do ye commit fornication after their abominations ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	31	And when ye offer your gifts , making your sons to pass through the fire , ye defile yourselves with all your idols , even unto this day ; and shall I be inquired of by you , O house of Israel ? [ As ] I live , saith the Lord Jehovah , I will not be inquired of by you .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	32	And that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all , that ye say , We will be as the nations , as the families of the countries , in serving wood and stone .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	33	[ As ] I live , saith the Lord Jehovah , verily with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with fury poured out , will I reign over you .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	34	And I will bring you out from the peoples , and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered , with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with fury poured out ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	35	and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples , and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	36	Like as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt , so will I enter into judgment with you , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	37	And I will cause you to pass under the rod , and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	38	And I will purge out from among you the rebels , and them that transgress against me ; I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn , but they shall not enter into the land of Israel : and ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	39	As for you , O house of Israel , thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Go ye , serve every one his idols henceforth also , if none of you will hearken unto me ; but profane my holy name no more with your gifts and with your idols .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	40	For in my holy mountain , in the mountain of the height of Israel , saith the Lord Jehovah , there shall all the house of Israel serve me , the whole of it , in the land ; there will I accept them , and there will I require your heave-offerings and the first-fruits of your offerings , with all your holy things .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	41	As a sweet savour will I accept you , when I bring you out from the peoples , and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered ; and I will be hallowed in you in the sight of the nations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	42	And ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah , when I have brought you into the land of Israel , into the country which I lifted up my hand to give to your fathers .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	43	And there shall ye remember your ways , and all your doings , wherein ye have been defiled ; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils which ye have committed .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	44	And ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah , when I have wrought with you for my name 's sake , not according to your wicked ways , nor according to your corrupt doings , O house of Israel , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	45	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	46	Son of man , set thy face toward the south , and drop [ words ] against the south , and prophesy against the forest of the south field ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	47	and say to the forest of the south , Hear the word of Jehovah . Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I will kindle a fire in thee , and it shall devour every green tree in thee , and every dry tree : the flashing flame shall not be quenched ; and all that it meets from the south to the north shall be burned thereby .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	48	And all flesh shall see that I Jehovah have kindled it : it shall not be quenched .
DARBY	Ezekiel	20	49	And I said , Ah , Lord Jehovah ! they say of me , Doth he not speak parables ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	21	For the king of Babylon standeth at the parting of the way , at the head of the two ways , to use divination : he shaketh [ his ] arrows , he inquireth of the teraphim , he looketh in the liver .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	2	Son of man , set thy face against Jerusalem , and drop [ words ] against the holy places , and prophesy against the land of Israel ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	3	and say to the land of Israel , Thus saith Jehovah : Behold , I am against thee , and I will draw forth my sword out of its sheath , and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	4	Seeing that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh , from the south to the north ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	5	and all flesh shall know that I Jehovah have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath : it shall not return any more .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	6	Sigh then , thou son of man ; with breaking of the loins , and with bitterness sigh before their eyes .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	7	And it shall be , when they say unto thee , Wherefore dost thou sigh ? that thou shalt say , Because of the tidings , for it cometh ; and every heart shall melt , and all hands shall be feeble , and every spirit shall languish , and all knees shall melt into water : behold , it cometh ; it is here , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	8	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	9	Son of man , prophesy , and say , Thus saith Jehovah : Say , A sword , a sword is sharpened , and also furbished .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	10	It is sharpened for sore slaughter , it is furbished that it may glitter . Shall we then make mirth , [ saying , ] The sceptre of my son contemneth all wood ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	11	And he hath given it to be furbished that it may be handled . The sword , —it is sharpened , and it is furbished to give it into the hand of the slayer .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	12	Cry and howl , son of man ; for it shall be against my people , it shall be against all the princes of Israel : they are given up to the sword along with my people : smite therefore upon the thigh .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	13	For the trial [ is made ] ; and what if even the contemning sceptre shall be no [ more ] ? saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	14	And thou , son of man , prophesy , and smite thy hands together ; for [ the strokes of ] the sword shall be doubled the third time : it is the sword of the slain , the sword that hath slain the great one , which encompasseth them privily .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	15	In order that the heart may melt , and the stumbling-blocks be multiplied , I have set the threatening sword against all their gates : ah ! it is made glittering , it is whetted for the slaughter .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	16	Gather up [ strength ] , go to the right hand , turn thee , go to the left , whithersoever thy face is appointed .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	17	And I myself will smite my hands together , and I will satisfy my fury : I Jehovah have spoken [ it ] .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	18	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	19	And thou , son of man , set thee two ways , by which the sword of the king of Babylon may come—out of one land shall they both come—and make thee a signpost , make it at the head of the way to the city .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	20	Appoint a way for the coming of the sword to Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and to Judah at the fenced [ city ] of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	22	In his right hand is the lot of Jerusalem to appoint battering-rams , to open the mouth for bloodshed , to lift up the voice with shouting , to appoint battering-rams against the gates , to cast mounds , to build siege-towers .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	23	And this shall be a false divination in their sight , for them that have sworn oaths ; but he will call to remembrance the iniquity , that they may be taken .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	24	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because ye make your iniquity to be remembered in that your transgressions are discovered , so that in all your doings your sins appear ; because ye are come to remembrance , ye shall be taken with the hand .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	25	And thou , profane , wicked prince of Israel , whose day is come , at the time of the iniquity of the end ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	26	—thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Remove the mitre and take off the crown ; what is shall be no [ more ] . Exalt that which is low , and abase that which is high .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	27	I will overturn , overturn , overturn it ! This also shall be no [ more ] , until he come whose right it is ; and I will give it [ to him ] .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	28	And thou , son of man , prophesy and say , Thus speaketh the Lord Jehovah concerning the children of Ammon , and concerning their reproach ; and thou shalt say , A sword , a sword is drawn ; for the slaughter is it furbished , that it may consume , that it may glitter :
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	29	whilst they see vanity for thee , whilst they divine a lie unto thee , to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that are slain , whose day is come at the time of the iniquity of the end .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	30	Restore [ it ] to its sheath . I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created , in the land of thy birth .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	31	And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee , I will blow upon thee the fire of my wrath , and give thee into the hand of brutish men , skilful to destroy .
DARBY	Ezekiel	21	32	Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire ; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land ; thou shalt not be remembered : for I Jehovah have spoken .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	22	As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace , so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof : and ye shall know that I Jehovah have poured out my fury upon you .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	2	And thou , son of man , wilt thou judge , wilt thou judge the bloody city ? Yea , cause her to know all her abominations ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	3	and say , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : A city that sheddeth blood in her midst , that her time may come , and maketh idols against herself to defile herself .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	4	Thou art become guilty by thy blood which thou hast shed , and hast defiled thyself with thine idols which thou hast made ; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near , and art come unto thy years : therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the nations , and a mocking unto all countries .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	5	Those that are near , and those that are far from thee , shall mock thee , who art infamous [ and ] full of tumult .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	6	Behold , the princes of Israel have been in thee to shed blood , each according to his power .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	7	In thee have they made light of father and mother ; in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger ; in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	8	Thou hast despised my holy things , and hast profaned my sabbaths .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	9	In thee there have been slanderous men to shed blood ; and in thee have they eaten upon the mountains ; in the midst of thee they have committed lewdness ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	10	in thee have they discovered their fathers ' nakedness ; in thee have they humbled her that was unclean in her separation .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	11	And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour 's wife ; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law ; and another in thee hath humbled his sister , his father 's daughter .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	12	In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood ; thou hast taken usury and increase , and thou hast overreached thy neighbours by oppression , and hast forgotten me , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	13	And behold , I have smitten mine hand at thine overreaching which thou hast done , and at thy bloodshed which hath been in the midst of thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	14	Shall thy heart endure , shall thy hands be strong , in the days that I shall deal with thee ? I Jehovah have spoken , and will do [ it ] .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	15	And I will scatter thee among the nations , and disperse thee through the countries , and will consume thy filthiness out of thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	16	And thou shalt be polluted through thyself in the sight of the nations , and thou shalt know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	17	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	18	Son of man , the house of Israel is become dross to me : they are all copper , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the midst of the furnace : they are become the dross of silver .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	19	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because ye are all become dross , therefore behold , I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	20	[ As ] they gather silver , and copper , and iron , and lead , and tin , into the midst of the furnace , to blow the fire upon it , to melt it , so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury , and I will lay you on and melt you .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	21	Yea , I will collect you , and blow upon you the fire of my wrath , and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	23	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	24	Son of man , say unto her , Thou art a land that is not cleansed , nor rained upon in the day of indignation .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	25	There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst of her like a roaring lion ravening the prey ; they devour souls ; they take away treasure and precious things ; they increase her widows in the midst of her ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	26	her priests do violence to my law , and profane my holy things : they put no difference between the holy and profane , neither do they make known [ the difference ] between the unclean and the clean , and they hide their eyes from my sabbaths , and I am profaned among them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	27	Her princes in the midst of her are like wolves ravening the prey , to shed blood , to destroy souls , to get dishonest gain .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	28	And her prophets have daubed for them with untempered [ mortar ] , seeing vanity and divining lies unto them , saying , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah ! and Jehovah hath not spoken .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	29	The people of the land use oppression and practise robbery ; and they vex the poor and needy , and oppress the stranger wrongfully .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	30	And I sought for a man among them , that should make up the fence , and stand in the breach before me for the land , that I should not destroy it ; but I found none .
DARBY	Ezekiel	22	31	And I will pour out mine indignation upon them ; I will consume them in the fire of my wrath : their own way will I recompense upon their head , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	23	The children of Babylon , and all the Chaldeans , Pekod and Shoa and Koa , all the children of Asshur with them ; all of them attractive young men , governors and rulers , great lords and renowned , all of them riding upon horses .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	2	Son of man , there were two women , daughters of one mother .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	3	And they committed whoredom in Egypt ; they committed whoredom in their youth : there were their breasts pressed , and there were handled the teats of their virginity .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	4	And their names were Oholah the elder , and Oholibah her sister ; and they were mine , and they bore sons and daughters . As for their names : Samaria is Oholah , and Jerusalem Oholibah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	5	And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine ; and she lusted after her lovers , after the Assyrians [ her ] neighbours ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	6	clothed with blue , governors and rulers , all of them attractive young men , horsemen riding upon horses .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	7	And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them , all of them the choice of the children of Asshur ; and with all after whom she lusted , with all their idols she defiled herself .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	8	Neither left she her whoredoms [ brought ] from Egypt ; for in her youth they had lain with her , and had handled the breasts of her virginity , and poured their fornication upon her .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	9	Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers , into the hand of the children of Asshur , after whom she lusted .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	10	These discovered her nakedness , they took her sons and her daughters , and slew her with the sword ; and she became a name among women ; and they executed judgment upon her .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	11	And her sister Oholibah saw [ this ] , and was more corrupt in her passion than she , and in her fornications more than the whoredoms of her sister .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	12	She lusted after the children of Asshur [ her ] neighbours , governors and rulers , clothed most gorgeously , horsemen riding upon horses , all of them attractive young men .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	13	And I saw that she was defiled : both took one way .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	14	And she increased her fornications ; for she saw men portrayed upon the wall , the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	15	girded with girdles upon their loins , with flowing turbans on their heads , all of them captains in appearance , [ after ] the likeness of the children of Babylon , of Chaldea , the land of their nativity .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	16	And as soon as she saw them with her eyes , she lusted after them , and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	17	And the children of Babylon came to her into the bed of love , and they defiled her with their fornication ; she too defiled herself with them , and her soul was alienated from them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	18	And she discovered her whoredoms , and discovered her nakedness ; and my soul was alienated from her , like as my soul was alienated from her sister .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	19	Yet she multiplied her whoredoms , calling to remembrance the days of her youth , wherein she played the harlot in the land of Egypt ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	20	and she lusted after their paramours , whose flesh is [ as ] the flesh of asses , and whose issue is [ as ] the issue of horses .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	21	And thou didst look back to the lewdness of thy youth , in the handling of thy teats by the Egyptians , for the breasts of thy youth .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	22	Therefore , Oholibah , thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I will raise up thy lovers against thee , from whom thy soul is alienated , and I will bring them against thee on every side .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	24	And they shall come against thee [ with ] armour , chariots and wheels , and with an assemblage of peoples ; they shall set themselves against thee [ with ] target , and shield , and helmet round about ; and I will put judgment before them , and they shall judge thee according to their judgments .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	25	And I will set my jealousy against thee , and they shall deal furiously with thee : they shall cut off thy nose and thine ears , and thy remnant shall fall by the sword ; they shall take thy sons and thy daughters ; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	26	They shall also strip the of thy garments , and take away thy fair jewels .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	27	And I will make thy lewdness to cease from thee , and thy whoredom [ brought ] from the land of Egypt ; and thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them , nor remember Egypt any more .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	28	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I will give thee over into the hand of them whom thou hatest , into the hand of them from whom thy soul is alienated .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	29	And they shall deal with thee in hatred , and shall take away all thy labour , and shall leave thee naked and bare ; so that the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered , both thy lewdness and thy fornications .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	30	These things shall be done unto thee , because thou hast gone a whoring after the nations , because thou hast defiled thyself with their idols .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	31	Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister ; and I have given her cup into thy hand .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	32	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Thou shalt drink of thy sister 's cup deep and large ; thou shalt be for a laughing-stock and a derision , [ for ] it containeth much .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	33	Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , the cup of thy sister Samaria ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	34	thou shalt even drink it and suck it out , and thou shalt gnaw the sherds thereof , and pluck off thine own breasts : for I have spoken [ it ] , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	35	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because thou hast forgotten me , and cast me behind thy back , therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy fornications .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	36	And Jehovah said unto me , Son of man , wilt thou judge Oholah and Oholibah ? yea , declare unto them their abominations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	37	For they have committed adultery , and blood is in their hands ; and with their idols have they committed adultery , and have also passed over unto them their children , whom they bore unto me , to be devoured .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	38	Moreover this have they done unto me : in the same day have they defiled my sanctuary and profaned my sabbaths .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	39	For when they had slaughtered their children unto their idols , they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it ; and behold , thus have they done in the midst of my house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	40	And furthermore , they sent for men to come from far , unto whom a messenger was sent ; and behold , they came : for whom thou didst wash thyself , paintedst thine eyes , and deckedst thyself with ornaments ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	41	and satest upon a stately bed , with a table prepared before it , whereupon thou hadst set mine incense and mine oil .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	42	And the voice of a multitude living carelessly was with her ; and with people of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness , and they put bracelets upon their hands , and a beautiful crown upon their heads .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	43	And I said of her that was old in adulteries , Will she now commit her fornications , even she .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	44	And they went in unto her , as they go in unto a whorish woman : so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah the lewd women .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	45	And righteous men , they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses , and with the judgment of women that shed blood ; for they are adulteresses , and blood is in their hands .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	46	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah : I will bring up an assemblage against them , and will give them to be driven hither and thither and spoiled .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	47	And the assemblage shall stone them with stones , and despatch them with their swords ; they shall kill their sons and their daughters , and burn their houses with fire .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	48	And I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land , and all women shall receive instruction and shall not do according to your lewdness .
DARBY	Ezekiel	23	49	And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you , and ye shall bear the sins of your idols ; and ye shall know that I [ am ] the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	24	Thus Ezekiel shall be unto you a sign ; according to all that he hath done shall ye do : when it cometh , then ye shall know that I [ am ] the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	2	Son of man , write thee the name of the day , of this selfsame day : on this selfsame day the king of Babylon draws near to Jerusalem .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	3	And propose a parable unto the rebellious house , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Set on the pot , set [ it ] on , and also pour water into it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	4	Gather the pieces thereof into it , every good piece , the thigh and the shoulder ; fill [ it ] with the choice bones :
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	5	take the choice of the flock ; and also [ put ] a pile of wood under it , for the bones ; make it boil well , and let the bones of it seethe therein .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	6	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Woe to the bloody city , to the pot whose rust is therein , and whose rust is not gone out of it ! Bring it out piece by piece ; let no lot fall upon it :
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	7	for her blood is in the midst of her ; she set it upon the bare rock ; she poured it not upon the ground , to cover it with dust .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	8	That it might cause fury to come up to execute vengeance , I have set her blood upon the bare rock , that it should not be covered .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	9	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Woe to the bloody city ! I also will make the pile great .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	10	Heap on the wood , kindle the fire , boil thoroughly the flesh , and spice it well , and let the bones be burned .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	11	Then set it empty upon its coals , that it may be hot , and the brass of it may burn , and that its filthiness may be molten in it , [ and ] that its rust may be consumed .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	12	She hath exhausted [ her ] labours , yet her great rust goeth not forth out of her : let her rust be in the fire .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	13	In thy filthiness is lewdness , for I have purged thee , and thou art not pure . Thou shalt no more be purged from thy filthiness , till I have satisfied my fury upon thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	14	I Jehovah have spoken [ it ] : it shall come to pass , and I will do it ; I will not go back , neither will I spare , nor will I repent . According to thy ways , and according to thy doings , shall they judge thee , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	15	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	16	Son of man , behold , I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke ; yet thou shalt not mourn nor weep , neither shall thy tears run down .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	17	Sigh in silence , make no mourning for the dead ; bind thy turban upon thee , and put thy sandals upon thy feet , and cover not the beard , and eat not the bread of men .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	18	—And I spoke unto the people in the morning ; and at even my wife died . And I did in the morning as I was commanded .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	19	And the people said unto me , Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us , which thou doest ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	20	And I said to them , The word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	21	Say unto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I will profane my sanctuary , the pride of your strength , the desire of your eyes , and your soul 's longing ; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	22	And ye shall do as I have done : ye shall not cover the beard , neither eat the bread of men ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	23	and your turbans shall be upon your heads , and your sandals upon your feet : ye shall not mourn nor weep ; but ye shall waste away in your iniquities and moan one toward another .
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	25	And thou , son of man , shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength , the joy of their glory , the desire of their eyes , and that whereunto they lift up their soul , their sons and their daughters ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	26	that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee , to cause [ thine ] ears to hear [ it ] ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	24	27	In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him that is escaped , and thou shalt speak , and be no more dumb . So shalt thou be a sign unto them ; and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	25	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	2	Son of man , set thy face against the children of Ammon , and prophesy against them ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	3	and say unto the children of Ammon , Hear the word of the Lord Jehovah . Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because thou saidst , Aha , against my sanctuary , when it was profaned ; and against the land of Israel , when it was made desolate ; and against the house of Judah , when they went into captivity :
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	4	therefore behold , I will give thee to the children of the east for a possession , and they shall set their encampments in thee , and make their dwellings in thee ; they shall eat thy fruits , and they shall drink thy milk .
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	5	And I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels , and the children of Ammon a couching-place for flocks : and ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	6	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because thou hast clapped the hands , and stamped with the feet , and rejoiced with all the despite of thy soul against the land of Israel ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	7	therefore behold , I will stretch out my hand upon thee , and will give thee for a spoil to the nations ; and I will cut thee off from the peoples , and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries : I will destroy thee , and thou shalt know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	8	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because Moab and Seir do say , Behold , the house of Judah is like unto all the nations ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	9	therefore behold , I will open the side of Moab from the cities , from his cities even to the last of them , the glory of the country , Beth-jeshimoth , Baal-meon , and Kirjathaim ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	10	unto the children of the east , with [ the land of ] the children of Ammon ; and I will give it them for a possession , that the children of Ammon may not be remembered among the nations :
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	11	and I will execute judgments upon Moab , and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	12	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance , and hath made himself very guilty , and revenged himself upon them ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	13	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : I will also stretch out my hand upon Edom ; and will cut off man and beast from it ; and I will make it desolate from Teman ; and unto Dedan shall they fall by the sword .
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	14	And I will execute my vengeance upon Edom , by the hand of my people Israel ; and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury ; and they shall know my vengeance , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	15	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge , and have taken vengeance with despite of soul , to destroy , from old hatred ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	16	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I stretch out my hands upon the Philistines , and I will cut off the Kerethites , and cause the remnant of the sea-coast to perish .
DARBY	Ezekiel	25	17	And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes ; and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah , when I shall lay my vengeance upon them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	26	And it came to pass in the eleventh year , on the first of the month , [ that ] the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	2	Son of man , because Tyre hath said against Jerusalem , Aha , she is broken , the gate of the peoples ! she is turned unto me : I shall be replenished [ now ] she is laid waste ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	3	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I am against thee , Tyre , and will cause many nations to come up against thee , as the sea causeth its waves to come up .
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	4	And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre , and break down her towers . And I will scrape her dust from her , and make her a bare rock .
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	5	She shall be [ a place ] for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea ; for I have spoken [ it ] , saith the Lord Jehovah ; and she shall become a spoil for the nations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	6	And her daughters that are in the field shall be slain by the sword ; and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	7	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I will bring from the north , against Tyre , Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , the king of kings , with horses , and with chariots , and with horsemen , and an assemblage , and much people .
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	8	He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field , and he shall make forts against thee , and cast up a mound against thee , and lift up the target against thee ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	9	and he shall set his engines of attack against thy walls , and with his spikes he shall break down thy towers .
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	10	By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee ; thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen , and of the wheels , and of the chariots , when he shall enter through thy gates , as a city is entered into , wherein is made a breach .
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	11	With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets ; he shall slay thy people by the sword , and the pillars of thy strength shall go down to the ground .
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	12	And they shall make a spoil of thy riches , and make a prey of thy wares ; and they shall break down thy walls , and destroy thy pleasant houses ; and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the waters .
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	13	And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease ; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard .
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	14	And I will make thee a bare rock ; thou shalt be [ a place ] for the spreading of nets ; thou shalt be built no more : for I Jehovah have spoken [ it ] , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	15	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to Tyre : Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall , when the wounded groan , when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	16	And all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones , and lay aside their robes , and put off their broidered garments : they shall clothe themselves with trembling , they shall sit upon the ground , and shall tremble [ every ] moment , and be astonied because of thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	17	And they shall take up a lamentation for thee , and say to thee , How hast thou perished , that wast inhabited from the seas , O renowned city , which wast strong in the sea , —she and her inhabitants , who caused their terror to be on all them that dwell therein !
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	18	Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall ; and the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure .
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	19	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah : When I shall make thee a desolate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I bring up the deep upon thee , and the great waters cover thee :
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	20	then will I bring thee down , with them that go down to the pit , to the people of old time , and will cause thee to dwell in the lower parts of the earth , in places desolate of old , with them that go down to the pit , that thou be not inhabited ; and I will set glory in the land of the living .
DARBY	Ezekiel	26	21	And I will make thee a terror , and thou shalt be no [ more ] ; and thou shalt be sought for , and shalt never be found again , for ever , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	27	Thy substance , and thy markets , thy merchandise , thy mariners , and thy pilots , they that repair thy leaks , and they that barter with thee , and all thy men of war that are in thee , along with all thine assemblage which is in the midst of thee , shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy fall .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	2	And thou , son of man , take up a lamentation for Tyre ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	3	and say unto Tyre : O thou that art situate at the entries of the sea , and traffickest with the peoples in many isles , thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Thou , Tyre , hast said , I am perfect in beauty .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	4	Thy borders are in the heart of the seas , thy builders have perfected thy beauty .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	5	They made all thy double boards of cypress-trees of Senir ; they took cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	6	Of the oaks of Bashan did they make thine oars ; they made thy benches of ivory , inlaid in box-wood , out of the isles of Chittim .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	7	Byssus with broidered work from Egypt was thy sail , to serve thee for a banner ; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was thine awning .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	8	The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy rowers ; thy wise men , O Tyre , who were in thee , were thy pilots .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	9	The elders of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee repairing thy leaks ; all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee , to barter with thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	10	Persia and Lud and Phut were in thine army , thy men of war : they hanged shield and helmet in thee ; they gave splendour to thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	11	The children of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about , and the Gammadim were on thy towers : they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about ; they made thy beauty perfect .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	12	Tarshish dealt with thee by reason of the abundance of all substance ; with silver , iron , tin , and lead , they furnished thy markets .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	13	Javan , Tubal , and Meshech , they were thy traffickers : they bartered with thee the persons of men , and vessels of bronze .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	14	They of the house of Togarmah furnished thy markets with horses , and horsemen , and mules .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	15	The children of Dedan were thy traffickers ; many isles were the mart of thy hand : they rendered in payment horns of ivory , and ebony .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	16	Syria dealt with thee for the multitude of thy handiworks : they traded in thy markets with carbuncles , purple , and broidered work , and fine linen , and corals , and rubies .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	17	Judah and the land of Israel were thy traffickers : they bartered with thee wheat of Minnith , and sweet cakes , and honey , and oil , and balm .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	18	Damascus dealt with thee because of the multitude of thy handiworks , by reason of the abundance of all substance , with wine of Helbon , and white wool .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	19	Vedan and Javan of Uzal traded in thy markets : wrought iron , cassia , and calamus were in thy traffic .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	20	Dedan was thy trafficker in precious riding-cloths .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	21	Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were the merchants of thy hand : in lambs , and rams , and goats , in these did they trade with thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	22	The merchants of Sheba and Raamah were thy traffickers : they furnished thy markets with all the choice spices , and with all precious stones and gold .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	23	Haran , and Canneh , and Eden , the merchants of Sheba , Asshur , and Chilmad traded with thee :
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	24	these traded with thee in sumptuous clothes , in wrappings of blue and broidered work , and in chests full of variegated stuffs , bound with cords and made of cedar-wood , amongst thy merchandise .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	25	The ships of Tarshish were thy caravans for thy traffic ; and thou wast replenished , and highly honoured , in the heart of the seas .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	26	Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters ; the east wind hath broken thee in the heart of the seas .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	28	The open places shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	29	And all that handle the oar , the mariners , all the pilots of the sea , shall come down from their ships ; they shall stand upon the land ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	30	and shall cause their voice to be heard over thee , and shall cry bitterly ; and they shall cast up dust upon their heads ; they shall wallow themselves in ashes .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	31	And they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee , and gird themselves with sackcloth ; and they shall weep for thee in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	32	And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee , and lament over thee , [ saying , ] Who is like Tyre , like her that is destroyed in the midst of the sea ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	33	When thy wares went forth over the seas , thou filledst many peoples ; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the abundance of thy substance and of thy merchandise .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	34	In the time [ when ] thou art broken by the seas , in the depths of the waters , thy merchandise and all thine assemblage in the midst of thee have fallen .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	35	All the inhabitants of the isles are amazed at thee , and their kings are horribly afraid , [ their ] countenance is troubled .
DARBY	Ezekiel	27	36	The merchants among the peoples hiss at thee ; thou art become a terror , and thou shalt never be any more .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	28	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	2	Son of man , say unto the prince of Tyre , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because thy heart is lifted up , and thou hast said , I am a god , I sit [ in ] the seat of God , in the heart of the seas , ( and thou art a man , and not God , ) and thou settest thy heart as the heart of God :
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	3	behold , thou art wiser than Daniel ! nothing secret is obscure for thee ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	4	by thy wisdom and by thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches , and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	5	by thy great wisdom thou hast by thy traffic increased thy riches , and thy heart is lifted up because of thy riches .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	6	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because thou hast set thy heart as the heart of God ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	7	therefore behold , I will bring strangers upon thee , the terrible of the nations ; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom , and they shall tarnish thy brightness .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	8	They shall bring thee down to the pit , and thou shalt die the deaths of those that are slain in the heart of the seas .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	9	Wilt thou then say before him that slayeth thee , I am God ? but thou shalt be a man , and not God , in the hand of him that pierceth thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	10	Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised , by the hand of strangers : for I have spoken [ it ] , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	11	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	12	Son of man , take up a lamentation upon the king of Tyre , and say unto him , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Thou , who sealest up the measure of perfection , full of wisdom and perfect in beauty ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	13	thou wast in Eden , the garden of God . Every precious stone was thy covering : the sardius , the topaz , and the diamond , the chrysolite , the onyx , and the jasper , the sapphire , the carbuncle , and the emerald , and gold . The workmanship of thy tambours and of thy pipes was in thee : in the day that thou wast created were they prepared .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	14	Thou wast the anointed covering cherub , and I had set thee [ so ] : thou wast upon the holy mountain of God ; thou didst walk up and down in the midst of stones of fire .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	15	Thou wast perfect in thy ways , from the day that thou wast created , till unrighteousness was found in thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	16	By the abundance of thy traffic they filled the midst of thee with violence , and thou hast sinned ; therefore have I cast thee as profane from the mountain of God , and have destroyed thee , O covering cherub , from the midst of the stones of fire .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	17	Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty ; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness : I have cast thee to the ground , I have laid thee before kings , that they may behold thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	18	By the multitude of thine iniquities , by the unrighteousness of thy traffic , thou hast profaned thy sanctuaries : and I have brought forth a fire out of the midst of thee—it hath consumed thee ; and I have brought thee to ashes upon the earth , in the sight of all them that behold thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	19	All they that know thee among the peoples shall be amazed at thee : thou art become a terror , and thou shalt never be any more .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	20	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	21	Son of man , set thy face towards Zidon , and prophesy against it ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	22	and say , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I am against thee , Zidon , and I will be glorified in the midst of thee ; and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah , when I shall have executed judgments in her , and shall be hallowed in her .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	23	And I will send into her the pestilence , and blood in her streets ; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her , by the sword upon her on every side : and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	24	And there shall be no more a wounding sting for the house of Israel , nor any grieving thorn , among all that were round about them , that despised them : and they shall know that I [ am ] the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	25	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered , and shall be hallowed in them in the sight of the nations , then shall they dwell in their land which I have given to my servant Jacob .
DARBY	Ezekiel	28	26	They shall dwell in it in safety , and shall build houses and plant vineyards ; and they shall dwell in safety , when I have executed judgments upon all those that despised them round about them : and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah their God .
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	29	In the tenth year , in the tenth [ month ] , on the twelfth of the month , the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	2	Son of man , set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and prophesy against him , and against the whole of Egypt ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	3	speak , and say , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I am against thee , Pharaoh king of Egypt , the great monster that lieth in the midst of his rivers , which saith , My river is mine own , and I made it for myself .
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	4	And I will put hooks in thy jaws , and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales , and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers , and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	5	and I will cast thee into the wilderness , thee and all the fish of thy rivers : thou shalt fall upon the open field ; thou shalt not be brought together nor gathered : I will give thee for meat to the beasts of the earth and to the fowl of the heavens .
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	6	And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah , because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	7	When they took hold of thee by thy hand , thou didst give way and rend all their shoulder ; and when they leaned upon thee , thou didst break , and didst make all their loins to tremble .
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	8	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I will bring a sword upon thee , and cut off man and beast from thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	9	And the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste : and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah , because he saith , The river is mine , and I made it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	10	Therefore behold , I am against thee , and against thy rivers , and I will make the land of Egypt deserts of wasteness and desolation , from Migdol to Syene , even unto the border of Ethiopia .
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	11	No foot of man shall pass through it , nor shall foot of beast pass through it , nor shall it be inhabited , forty years .
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	12	And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolated , and her cities shall be , in the midst of the cities that are laid waste , a desolation forty years ; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries .
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	13	Yet thus saith the Lord Jehovah : At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	14	and I will turn again the captivity of Egypt , and will cause them to return to the land of Pathros , into the land of their birth , and they shall there be a base kingdom .
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	15	It shall be the basest of kingdoms ; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations ; and I will diminish them , so that they shall no more rule over the nations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	16	And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel , bringing iniquity to remembrance , when they turn after them : and they shall know that I [ am ] the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	17	And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year , in the first [ month ] , on the first of the month , [ that ] the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	18	Son of man , Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to do hard service against Tyre ; every head was made bald , and every shoulder was peeled : yet had he from Tyre no wages , nor his army , for the service that he had served against it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	19	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon ; and he shall carry away her multitude , and seize her spoil , and take her prey ; and it shall be the wages for his army .
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	20	I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it , because they wrought for me , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	29	21	In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth , and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them : and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	30	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	2	Son of man , prophesy and say , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Howl ye , Alas for the day !
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	3	For the day is at hand , yea , the day of Jehovah is at hand , a day of clouds ; it shall be the time of the nations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	4	And the sword shall come upon Egypt , and there shall be anguish in Ethiopia , when the slain shall fall in Egypt , and they shall take away her multitude , and her foundations shall be overthrown .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	5	Cush , and Phut , and Lud , and all the mingled people , and Chub , and the children of the land that is in league , shall fall with them by the sword .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	6	Thus saith Jehovah : They also that uphold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her strength shall come down : from Migdol to Syene shall they fall in her by the sword , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	7	And they shall be desolated in the midst of the countries that are desolated , and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	8	And they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah , when I have set a fire in Egypt , and all her helpers shall be broken .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	9	In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships , to make careless Ethiopia afraid ; and anguish shall come upon them , as in the day of Egypt : for behold , it cometh !
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	10	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	11	He and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought to destroy the land ; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt , and fill the land with slain .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	12	And I will make the rivers dry , and sell the land into the hand of the wicked ; and I will make the land desolate , and all that is therein , by the hand of strangers : I Jehovah have spoken [ it ] .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	13	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : I will also destroy the idols , and I will cause the images to cease out of Noph ; and there shall be no more a prince out of the land of Egypt ; and I will put fear in the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	14	And I will make Pathros desolate , and will set a fire in Zoan , and will execute judgment in No .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	15	And I will pour my fury upon Sin , the stronghold of Egypt ; and I will cut off the multitude of No .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	16	And I will set a fire in Egypt : Sin shall be in great anguish , and No shall be rent asunder , and at Noph [ there shall be ] enemies in open day .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	17	The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword ; and these shall go into captivity .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	18	And at Tehaphnehes the day shall be darkened , when I break there the yokes of Egypt , and the pride of her strength shall cease in her ; as for her , a cloud shall cover her , and her daughters shall go into captivity .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	19	Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt ; and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	20	And it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the first [ month ] , on the seventh of the month , the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	21	Son of man , I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt ; and behold , it shall not be bound up to apply remedies , to put a bandage to bind it , to make it strong to hold the sword .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	22	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong one , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	23	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and will disperse them through the countries .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	24	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , and put my sword in his hand ; and I will break Pharaoh 's arms , so that he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly-wounded [ man ] .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	25	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon , and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down ; and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah , when I have put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall have stretched it out upon the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Ezekiel	30	26	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and disperse them through the countries : and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	31	And it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the third [ month ] , on the first of the month , [ that ] the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	2	Son of man , say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , and to his multitude : Whom art thou like in thy greatness ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	3	Behold , Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon , with fair branches and a shadowing shroud , and of a high stature : and his top was amidst the thick boughs .
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	4	The waters made him great , the deep set him up on high ; its streams ran round about his plantation , and it sent out its rivulets unto all the trees of the field .
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	5	Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field , and his boughs were multiplied , and his branches became long , because of great waters , when he shot forth .
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	6	All the fowl of the heavens made their nests in his boughs , and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young , and under his shadow dwelt all the great nations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	7	Thus was he fair in his greatness , in the length of his branches : because his root was by great waters .
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	8	The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him ; the cypresses were not like his boughs , and the plane-trees were not as his branches : no tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty .
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	9	I had made him fair by the multitude of his branches ; and all the trees of Eden , that were in the garden of God , envied him .
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	10	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because thou hast lifted up thyself in stature , … and he hath set his top amidst the thick boughs , and his heart is lifted up in his height ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	11	I have given him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations ; he shall surely deal with him : I have driven him out for his wickedness .
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	12	And strangers , the terrible of the nations , have cut him off and have left him ; upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen , and his boughs are broken in all the watercourses of the land ; and all the peoples of the earth are gone down from his shadow , and have left him .
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	13	Upon his fallen [ trunk ] do all the fowl of the heavens dwell , and all the beasts of the field are upon his branches :
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	14	to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature , nor set their top amidst the thick boughs , and that none of them that drink water stand up in his height by himself ; for they are all given over unto death in the lower parts of the earth , in the midst of the children of men , with them that go down to the pit .
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	15	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : In the day when he went down to Sheol , I caused a mourning : I covered the deep for him , and I restrained the floods thereof , and the great waters were stayed ; and I made Lebanon black for him , and all the trees of the field fainted for him .
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	16	I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall , when I cast him down to Sheol , with them that go down into the pit ; and all the trees of Eden , the choice and best of Lebanon , all that drink water , were comforted in the lower parts of the earth .
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	17	They also went down into Sheol with him unto them that were slain with the sword , and [ that were ] his arm , that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	31	18	To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden ? Yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden , unto the lower parts of the earth ; thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised , with them that are slain by the sword . This is Pharaoh and all his multitude , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	32	For I have caused my terror in the land of the living ; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised , with them that are slain by the sword , Pharaoh and all his multitude , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	2	Son of man , take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt , and say unto him , Thou wast like a young lion among the nations , and thou wast as a monster in the seas ; and thou didst break forth in thy rivers , and troubledst the waters with thy feet , and fouledst their rivers .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	3	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : I will also spread out my net over thee with an assemblage of many peoples ; and they shall bring thee up in my net .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	4	And I will leave thee upon the land , I will cast thee forth upon the open field , and will cause all the fowl of the heavens to settle upon thee , and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	5	And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains , and fill the valleys with the heap of thy [ members ] ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	6	and I will water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest , even to the mountains ; and the water-courses shall be full of thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	7	And when I shall put thee out , I will cover the heavens , and make the stars thereof black ; I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give her light .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	8	All the bright lights of the heavens will I make black over thee , and bring darkness upon thy land , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	9	And I will vex the heart of many peoples , when I bring [ the news of ] thy destruction among the nations , into the countries that thou hast not known .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	10	And I will make many peoples amazed at thee , and their kings shall be horribly afraid at thee , when I brandish my sword before them ; and they shall tremble at every moment , each one for his life , in the day of thy fall .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	11	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah : The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	12	By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall : the terrible of the nations are they all : and they shall spoil the pride of Egypt , and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	13	And I will destroy all the beasts thereof , from beside the great waters ; and the foot of man shall not trouble them any more , nor shall the cloven hoofs of beasts trouble them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	14	Then will I make their waters clear , and cause their rivers to run like oil , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	15	When I shall make the land of Egypt a desolation , and the country shall be left desolate of all that was in it , when I have smitten all them that dwell therein , then shall they know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	16	It is a lamentation , and [ thus ] they shall lament her : the daughters of the nations shall say it in lamenting ; they shall say it in lamenting over Egypt and over all her multitude , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	17	And it came to pass in the twelfth year , on the fifteenth of the month , the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	18	Son of man , wail for the multitude of Egypt , and cast them down , her and the daughters of the famous nations , unto the lower parts of the earth , with them that go down into the pit .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	19	Whom dost thou surpass in beauty ? Go down , and be thou laid with the uncircumcised .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	20	They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword . The sword hath been given : draw her out , and all her multitudes .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	21	The strong among the mighty , with them that helped him , shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol : they are gone down , they lie still , the uncircumcised , slain by the sword .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	22	There is Asshur and all his assemblage , his graves round about him : all of them slain , fallen by the sword ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	23	their graves are set in the sides of the pit , and his assemblage is round about his grave ; all of them slain , fallen by the sword , —who caused terror in the land of the living .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	24	There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave , all of them slain , fallen by the sword , who are gone down uncircumcised unto the lower parts of the earth , who caused their terror in the land of the living ; yet have they borne their confusion with them that go down to the pit .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	25	They have set him a bed in the midst of the slain , with all his multitude : their graves are round about him , all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword , though their terror was caused in the land of the living ; and they have borne their confusion with them that go down to the pit : he is put in the midst of them that are slain .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	26	There is Meshech , Tubal , and all their multitude , their graves round about them , all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	27	And they lie not with the mighty , [ that are ] fallen of the uncircumcised , who are gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war ; and whose swords are laid under their heads , and whose iniquities are upon their bones , though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	28	Thou also shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised , and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	29	There is Edom , her kings , and all her princes , who in their might are laid with them that are slain by the sword : they lie with the uncircumcised , and with them that go down to the pit .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	30	There are the princes of the north , all of them , and all the Zidonians , that are gone down with the slain—ashamed of the terror which they caused through their might ; and they lie uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword , and bear their confusion with them that go down to the pit .
DARBY	Ezekiel	32	31	Pharaoh shall see them , and shall be comforted over all his multitude , Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	33	And when this cometh to pass ( behold , it will come ) , then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	2	Son of man , speak to the children of thy people , and say unto them , When I bring the sword upon a land , and the people of the land take one man from among them all , and set him for their watchman :
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	3	if he see the sword coming upon the land , and blow the trumpet , and warn the people ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	4	then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet , and taketh not warning , if the sword come and take him away , his blood shall be upon his own head .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	5	He heard the sound of the trumpet , and took not warning ; his blood is upon him : whereas had he taken warning , he would have delivered his soul .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	6	But if the watchman see the sword coming , and blow not the trumpet , and the people be not warned , if the sword come and take a person from among them , he is taken away in his iniquity ; but his blood will I require at the watchman 's hand .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	7	So thou , son of man , I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel ; and thou shalt hear the word from my mouth , and warn them from me .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	8	When I say unto the wicked , Wicked [ man ] , thou shalt certainly die ; and thou speakest not to warn the wicked from his way , that wicked [ man ] shall die in his iniquity ; but his blood will I require at thy hand .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	9	But if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it , and he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered thy soul .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	10	And thou , son of man , say unto the house of Israel , Thus ye speak , saying , Our transgressions and our sins are upon us , and we waste away in them , how then should we live ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	11	Say unto them , As I live , saith the Lord Jehovah , I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked ; but that the wicked turn from his way and live . Turn ye , turn ye from your evil ways ; for why will ye die , O house of Israel ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	12	And thou , son of man , say unto the children of thy people , The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression ; and as for the wickedness of the wicked , he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness ; neither shall the righteous be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	13	When I say to the righteous that he shall certainly live , and he trusteth to his righteousness and doeth what is wrong , none of his righteous acts shall be remembered ; but in his unrighteousness which he hath done , in it shall he die .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	14	And when I say unto the wicked , Thou shalt certainly die , and he turneth from his sin , and doeth judgment and justice ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	15	if the wicked restore the pledge , give again that he had taken by robbery , walk in the statutes of life , doing nothing that is wrong ; he shall certainly live , he shall not die .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	16	None of his sins which he hath committed shall be remembered against him : he hath done judgment and justice ; he shall certainly live .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	17	Yet the children of thy people say , The way of the Lord is not equal : but as for them , their way is not equal .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	18	When the righteous turneth from his righteousness , and doeth what is wrong , then he shall die therein .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	19	And when the wicked turneth from his wickedness , and doeth judgment and justice , he shall live for these things .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	20	Yet ye say , The way of the Lord is not equal . O house of Israel , I will judge you every one after his ways .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	21	And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity , in the tenth [ month ] , on the fifth of the month , that one who had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me , saying , The city is smitten !
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	22	Now the hand of Jehovah had been upon me in the evening , before he that had escaped came ; and he had opened my mouth against his coming to me in the morning ; and my mouth was opened , and I was no more dumb .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	23	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	24	Son of man , they that inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak , saying , Abraham was one , and he inherited this land , and we are many : the land is given us for a possession .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	25	Therefore say unto them , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Ye eat with the blood , and lift up your eyes toward your idols , and shed blood ; and shall ye possess the land ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	26	Ye stand upon your sword , ye work abomination , and ye defile every one his neighbour 's wife ; and shall ye possess the land ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	27	Say thou thus unto them , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : [ As ] I live , verily they that are in the waste places shall fall by the sword , and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured , and they that are in the strongholds and in the caves shall die of the pestilence .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	28	And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment , and the pride of her strength shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolated , so that none shall pass through .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	29	And they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah , when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment because of all their abominations which they have committed .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	30	And as for thee , son of man , the children of thy people keep talking of thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses , and speak one to another , every one to his brother , saying , Come , I pray you , and hear what is the word that cometh forth from Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	31	And they come unto thee as a people cometh , and they sit before thee [ as ] my people , and they hear thy words , but they do them not ; for with their mouth they shew much love , [ but ] their heart goeth after their dishonest gain .
DARBY	Ezekiel	33	32	And behold , thou art unto them as a lovely song , a pleasant voice , and one that playeth well on an instrument ; and they hear thy words , but they do them not .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	34	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	2	Son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of Israel , prophesy ; and say unto them , unto the shepherds , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Woe to the shepherds of Israel that feed themselves ! Should not the shepherds feed the flock ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	3	Ye eat the fat , and ye clothe you with the wool ; ye kill them that are fattened : [ but ] ye feed not the flock .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	4	The weak have ye not strengthened , nor have ye healed the sick , and ye have not bound up [ what was ] broken , neither have ye brought again that which was driven away , neither have ye sought for that which was lost ; but with harshness and with rigour have ye ruled over them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	5	And they were scattered because there was no shepherd ; and they became meat to all the beasts of the field , and were scattered .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	6	My sheep wandered through all the mountains , and upon every high hill , and my sheep have been scattered upon all the face of the earth , and there was none that searched , or that sought for them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	7	Therefore , ye shepherds , hear the word of Jehovah :
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	8	[ As ] I live , saith the Lord Jehovah , verily because my sheep have been a prey , and my sheep have been meat to every beast of the field , because there was no shepherd , and my shepherds searched not for my flock , but the shepherds fed themselves , and fed not my flock ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	9	—therefore , ye shepherds , hear the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	10	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I am against the shepherds ; and I will require my sheep at their hand , and cause them to cease from feeding the flock : that the shepherds may feed themselves no more ; and I will deliver my sheep from their mouth , that they may not be food for them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	11	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold I , [ even ] I , will both search for my sheep , and tend them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	12	As a shepherd tendeth his flock in the day that he is among his scattered sheep , so will I tend my sheep , and will deliver them out of all places whither they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	13	And I will bring them out from the peoples , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them to their own land ; and I will feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the water-courses , and in all the habitable places of the country .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	14	I will feed them in a good pasture , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie down in a good fold , and in a fat pasture they shall feed upon the mountains of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	15	I will myself feed my flock , and I will cause them to lie down , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	16	I will seek the lost , and bring again that which was driven away , and will bind up the broken , and will strengthen that which was sick ; but I will destroy the fat and the strong : I will feed them with judgment .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	17	And as for you , my flock , thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I judge between sheep and sheep , between the rams and the he-goats .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	18	Is it too small a thing unto you to have eaten up the good pastures , but ye must tread down with your feet the rest of your pastures ; and to have drunk of the settled waters , but ye must foul the rest with your feet ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	19	And my sheep have to eat that which ye have trodden with your feet , and to drink that which ye have fouled with your feet .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	20	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto them : Behold , [ it is ] I , and I will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	21	Because ye thrust with side and with shoulder , and push all the weak ones with your horns , till ye have scattered them abroad ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	22	—I will save my flock , that they may no more be a prey ; and I will judge between sheep and sheep .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	23	And I will set up one shepherd over them , and he shall feed them , even my servant David : he shall feed them , and he shall be their shepherd .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	24	And I Jehovah will be their God , and my servant David a prince in their midst : I Jehovah have spoken [ it ] .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	25	And I will make with them a covenant of peace , and will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land ; and they shall dwell in safety in the wilderness , and sleep in the woods .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	26	And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing ; and I will cause the shower to come down in its season : there shall be showers of blessing .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	27	And the tree of the field shall yield its fruit , and the earth shall yield its increase ; and they shall be in safety in their land , and shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah , when I have broken the bands of their yoke and delivered them out of the hand of those that kept them in servitude .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	28	And they shall no more be a prey to the nations , neither shall the beast of the earth devour them ; but they shall dwell in safety , and none shall make them afraid .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	29	And I will raise up for them a plant of renown , and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land , neither bear the ignominy of the nations any more .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	30	And they shall know that I Jehovah their God [ am ] with them , and that they , the house of Israel , are my people , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	34	31	And ye , my flock , the flock of my pasture , are men : I [ am ] your God , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	35	35	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	35	2	Son of man , set thy face against mount Seir , and prophesy against it ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	35	3	and say unto it , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I am against thee , mount Seir , and I will stretch out my hand upon thee , and I will make thee a desolation and an astonishment .
DARBY	Ezekiel	35	4	I will lay thy cities waste , and thou shalt be a desolation : and thou shalt know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	35	5	Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred , and hast given over the children of Israel to the power of the sword , in the time of their calamity , in the time of the iniquity of the end ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	35	6	therefore , [ as ] I live , saith the Lord Jehovah , I will certainly appoint thee unto blood , and blood shall pursue thee ; since thou hast not hated blood , blood shall pursue thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	35	7	And I will make mount Seir a desolation and an astonishment , and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	35	8	and I will fill his mountains with his slain . In thy hills , and in thy valleys , and in all thy water-courses shall they fall that are slain with the sword .
DARBY	Ezekiel	35	9	I will make thee perpetual desolations , and thy cities shall not be inhabited : and ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	35	10	Because thou hast said , These two nations and these two countries shall be mine , and we will possess it , whereas Jehovah was there :
DARBY	Ezekiel	35	11	therefore , [ as ] I live , saith the Lord Jehovah , I will even do according to thine anger and according to thine envy , as thou hast done out of thy hatred against them ; and I will make myself known among them , when I shall judge thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	35	12	And thou shalt know that I Jehovah have heard all thy reproaches , which thou hast uttered against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid desolate , they are given us to devour .
DARBY	Ezekiel	35	13	And ye have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth , and have multiplied your words against me : I have heard [ them ] .
DARBY	Ezekiel	35	14	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : When the whole earth rejoiceth , I will make thee a desolation .
DARBY	Ezekiel	35	15	As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel , because it was desolated , so will I do unto thee : thou shalt be a desolation , O mount Seir , and all Edom , the whole of it : and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	36	And the nations that shall be left round about you shall know that I Jehovah build the ruined places [ and ] plant that which was desolate : I Jehovah have spoken , and I will do [ it ] .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	2	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because the enemy hath said against you , Aha ! and , The ancient high places are become ours in possession ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	3	therefore prophesy and say , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because , yea , because they have made [ you ] desolate , and have swallowed you up on every side , that ye might be a possession unto the remnant of the nations , and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers , and in the defaming of the people :
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	4	therefore , ye mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord Jehovah . Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills , to the water-courses and to the valleys , to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken , which are become a prey and a derision to the remnant of the nations that are round about ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	5	—therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the remnant of the nations , and against the whole of Edom , which have appointed my land unto themselves for a possession with the joy of all [ their ] heart , with despite of soul , to plunder it by pillage .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	6	Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel , and say to the mountains and to the hills , to the water-courses and to the valleys , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury , because ye have borne the ignominy of the nations ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	7	therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : I have lifted up my hand , [ saying , ] Verily the nations that are about you , they shall bear their shame .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	8	And ye mountains of Israel shall shoot forth your branches , and yield your fruit to my people Israel : for they are at hand to come .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	9	For behold , I am for you , and I will turn unto you , and ye shall be tilled and sown .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	10	And I will multiply men upon you , all the house of Israel , the whole of it ; and the cities shall be inhabited , and the waste places shall be builded .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	11	And I will multiply upon you man and beast , and they shall increase and bring forth fruit ; and I will cause you to be inhabited as [ in ] your former times , yea , I will make it better than at your beginnings : and ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	12	And I will cause men to walk upon you , even my people Israel ; and they shall possess thee , and thou shalt be their inheritance , and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of children .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	13	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Because they say unto you , Thou devourest men , and hast bereaved thy nation ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	14	therefore thou shalt devour men no more , neither bereave thy nation any more , saith the Lord Jehovah ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	15	neither will I cause thee to hear the ignominy of the nations any more , and thou shalt not bear the reproach of the peoples any more , neither shalt thou cause thy nation to fall any more , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	16	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	17	Son of man , when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land , they defiled it by their way and by their doings : their way was before me as the uncleanness of a woman in her separation .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	18	And I poured out my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land , and because they had defiled it with their idols .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	19	And I scattered them among the nations , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their doings I judged them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	20	And when they came to the nations whither they went , they profaned my holy name , when it was said of them , These are the people of Jehovah , and they are gone forth out of his land .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	21	But I had pity for my holy name , which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations whither they went .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	22	Therefore say unto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : I do not this for your sakes , O house of Israel , but for my holy name , which ye have profaned among the nations whither ye went .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	23	And I will hallow my great name , which was profaned among the nations , which ye have profaned in the midst of them ; and the nations shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah , saith the Lord Jehovah , when I shall be hallowed in you before their eyes .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	24	And I will take you from among the nations , and gather you out of all the countries , and will bring you into your own land .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	25	And I will sprinkle clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean : from all your uncleannesses and from all your idols will I cleanse you .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	26	And I will give you a new heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and I will give you a heart of flesh .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	27	And I will put my Spirit within you , and cause you to walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances , and ye shall do them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	28	And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers , and ye shall be my people , and I will be your God .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	29	And I will save you from all your uncleannesses ; and I will call for the corn and will multiply it , and lay no famine upon you .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	30	And I will multiply the fruit of the trees and the increase of the field , so that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	31	And ye shall remember your evil ways , and your doings which were not good , and shall loathe yourselves for your iniquities and for your abominations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	32	Not for your sakes do I this , saith the Lord Jehovah , be it known unto you : be ashamed and confounded for your ways , O house of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	33	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : In the day that I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities I will also cause the cities to be inhabited , and the waste places shall be builded .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	34	And the desolate land shall be tilled , whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	35	And they shall say , This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden ; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities [ are ] fortified [ and ] inhabited .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	37	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel , to do it unto them ; I will increase them with men like a flock .
DARBY	Ezekiel	36	38	As the holy flock , as the flock of Jerusalem in her set feasts , so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men : and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	37	The hand of Jehovah was upon me , and Jehovah carried me out in the Spirit , and set me down in the midst of a valley ; and it was full of bones .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	2	And he caused me to pass by them round about ; and behold , there were very many in the open valley ; and behold , they were very dry .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	3	And he said unto me , Son of man , Shall these bones live ? And I said , Lord Jehovah , thou knowest .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	4	And he said unto me , Prophesy over these bones , and say unto them , Ye dry bones , hear the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	5	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones : Behold , I will cause breath to enter into you , and ye shall live .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	6	And I will put sinews upon you , and will bring up flesh upon you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and ye shall live : and ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	7	And I prophesied as I was commanded ; and as I prophesied , there was a noise , and behold a rustling , and the bones came together , bone to its bone .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	8	And I looked , and behold , sinews and flesh came up upon them , and the skin covered them over ; but there was no breath in them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	9	And he said unto me , Prophesy unto the wind , prophesy , son of man , and say to the wind , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Come from the four winds , O breath , and breathe upon these slain , that they may live .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	10	And I prophesied as he had commanded me , and the breath came into them , and they lived , and stood up upon their feet , an exceeding great army .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	11	And he said unto me , Son of man , these bones are the whole house of Israel . Behold , they say , Our bones are dried , and our hope is lost : we are cut off !
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	12	Therefore prophesy and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , O my people , and bring you into the land of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	13	And ye shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah , when I have opened your graves , and have caused you to come up out of your graves , O my people .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	14	And I will put my Spirit in you , and ye shall live , and I will place you in your own land : and ye shall know that I Jehovah have spoken , and have done [ it ] , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	15	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	16	And thou , son of man , take thee one stick , and write upon it , For Judah , and for the children of Israel , his companions . And take another stick , and write upon it , For Joseph , the stick of Ephraim and all the house of Israel , his companions .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	17	And join them one to another into one stick ; and they shall become one in thy hand .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	18	And when the children of my people speak unto thee , saying , Wilt thou not declare unto us what thou meanest by these ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	19	say unto them , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I will take the stick of Joseph , which is in the hand of Ephraim , and the tribes of Israel his companions , and will put them with this , with the stick of Judah , and make them one stick , and they shall be one in my hand .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	20	And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thy hand before their eyes .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	21	And say unto them , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I will take the children of Israel from among the nations , whither they are gone , and will gather them from every side , and bring them into their own land :
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	22	and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all : and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	23	And they shall not defile themselves any more with their idols , or with their detestable things , or with any of their transgressions ; and I will save them out of all their dwelling-places wherein they have sinned , and will cleanse them ; and they shall be my people , and I will be their God .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	24	And David my servant shall be king over them ; and they all shall have one shepherd : and they shall walk in mine ordinances , and keep my statutes , and do them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	25	And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant , wherein your fathers have dwelt ; and they shall dwell therein , they , and their children , and their children 's children for ever : and David my servant shall be their prince for ever .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	26	And I will make a covenant of peace with them : it shall be an everlasting covenant with them ; and I will place them , and multiply them , and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	27	And my tabernacle shall be over them ; and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
DARBY	Ezekiel	37	28	And the nations shall know that I Jehovah do hallow Israel , when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever .
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	38	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	2	Son of man , set thy face against Gog , the land of Magog , the prince of Rosh , Meshech , and Tubal , and prophesy against him ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	3	and say , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I am against thee , O Gog , prince of Rosh , Meshech , and Tubal .
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	4	And I will turn thee back , and put hooks into thy jaws , and I will bring thee forth , and all thine army , horses and horsemen , all of them thoroughly equipped , a great assemblage with targets and shields , all of them handling swords :
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	5	Persia , Cush , and Phut with them , all of them with shield and helmet ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	6	Gomer , and all his bands ; the house of Togarmah from the uttermost north , and all his bands ; —many peoples with thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	7	Be thou prepared , and prepare for thyself thou , and all thine assemblage that are assembled unto thee , and be thou a guard unto them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	8	After many days shalt thou be visited ; at the end of years thou shalt come into the land brought back from the sword [ and ] gathered out of many peoples , upon the mountains of Israel which have been a perpetual waste : but it is brought forth out from the peoples , and they shall all of them be dwelling in safety .
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	9	And thou shalt ascend , thou shalt come like a storm , thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land , thou , and all thy bands , and many peoples with thee .
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	10	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : It shall even come to pass in that day that things shall come into thy mind , and thou shalt think an evil thought ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	11	and thou shalt say , I will go up to the land of unwalled villages ; I will come to them that are in quiet , that dwell in safety , all of them dwelling without walls , and having neither bars nor gates ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	12	to seize a spoil , and to take a prey ; to turn thy hand against the waste places that are [ now ] inhabited , and against a people gathered out of the nations , which have gotten cattle and goods , that dwell in the middle of the land .
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	13	Sheba , and Dedan , and the merchants of Tarshish , with all the young lions thereof , shall say unto thee , Art thou come to seize a spoil ? hast thou gathered thine assemblage to take a prey ? to carry away silver and gold , to take cattle and goods , to seize a great spoil ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	14	Therefore prophesy , son of man , and say unto Gog , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : In that day when my people Israel dwelleth in safety , shalt thou not know [ it ] ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	15	And thou shalt come from thy place out of the uttermost north , thou and many peoples with thee , all of them riding upon horses , a great assemblage and a mighty army .
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	16	And thou shalt come up against my people Israel as a cloud to cover the land—it shall be at the end of days—and I will bring thee against my land , that the nations may know me , when I shall be hallowed in thee , O Gog , before their eyes .
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	17	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Art thou not he of whom I have spoken in old time through my servants the prophets of Israel , who prophesied in those days , for [ many ] years , that I would bring thee against them ?
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	18	And it shall come to pass in that day , in the day when Gog shall come against the land of Israel , saith the Lord Jehovah , [ that ] my fury shall come up in my face ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	19	for in my jealousy , in the fire of my wrath have I spoken , Verily in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	20	so that the fish of the sea , and the fowl of the heavens , and the beasts of the field , and all creeping things which creep upon the earth , and all mankind that are upon the face of the earth shall shake at my presence ; and the mountains shall be thrown down , and the steep places shall fall , and every wall shall fall to the ground .
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	21	And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains , saith the Lord Jehovah : every man 's sword shall be against his brother .
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	22	And I will enter into judgment with him with pestilence and with blood ; and I will rain upon him , and upon his bands , and upon the many peoples that are with him , overflowing rain and great hailstones , fire and brimstone .
DARBY	Ezekiel	38	23	And I will magnify myself , and sanctify myself , and I will be known in the eyes of many nations , and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	39	And thou , son of man , prophesy against Gog , and say , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Behold , I am against thee , O Gog , prince of Rosh , Meshech , and Tubal ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	2	and I will turn thee back , and lead thee , and will cause thee to come up from the uttermost north , and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	3	And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand , and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	4	Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel , thou , and all thy bands , and the peoples that are with thee : I have given thee to be meat for the birds of prey of every wing , and to the beasts of the field .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	5	Thou shalt fall on the open field ; for I have spoken [ it ] , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	6	And I will send a fire on Magog , and among them that dwell at ease in the isles : and they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	7	And my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel ; and I will not suffer my holy name to be profaned any more : and the nations shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah , the Holy One in Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	8	Behold , it cometh , and shall be done , saith the Lord Jehovah . This is the day whereof I have spoken .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	9	And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth , and shall kindle fire , and burn weapons , and shields , and targets , bows , and arrows , and hand-staves , and spears : and they shall make fires with them seven years .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	10	And no wood shall be taken out of the field , neither cut down out of the forests ; for they shall make fire with the weapons ; and they shall spoil those that spoiled them , and plunder those that plundered them , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	11	And it shall come to pass in that day , [ that ] I will give unto Gog a place there for burial in Israel , the valley of the passers-by to the east of the sea ; and it shall stop [ the way ] of the passers-by ; and there shall they bury Gog and all the multitude ; and they shall call it , Valley of Hamon-Gog .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	12	And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them , that they may cleanse the land ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	13	and all the people of the land shall bury [ them ] ; and it shall be to them for renown in the day that I shall be glorified , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	14	And they shall sever out men of continual employment to go through the land , who , with the passers-by , shall bury those that remain upon the face of the land , to cleanse it : at the end of seven months shall they make a search .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	15	And the passers-by shall pass through the land , and when [ any ] seeth a man 's bone , he shall set up a sign by it , till the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon-Gog .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	16	And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah . Thus shall they cleanse the land .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	17	And thou , son of man , thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Speak unto the birds of every wing , and to every beast of the field , Gather yourselves together and come , assemble yourselves on every side to my sacrifice which I sacrifice for you , a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel , that ye may eat flesh , and drink blood .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	18	Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty , and drink the blood of the princes of the earth , of rams , of lambs , and of goats , [ and ] of bullocks , all of them fatted beasts of Bashan .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	19	And ye shall eat fat till ye are full , and drink blood till ye are drunken , of my sacrifice which I sacrifice for you .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	20	And ye shall be filled at my table with horses and charioteers , with mighty men , and with all men of war , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	21	And I will set my glory among the nations , and all the nations shall see my judgment which I have executed , and my hand which I have laid upon them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	22	And the house of Israel shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah their God from that day and forward .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	23	And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity , because they were unfaithful against me ; and I hid my face from them , and gave them into the hand of their enemies , so that they fell all of them by the sword .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	24	According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I did unto them , and I hid my face from them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	25	Therefore , thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Now will I bring again the captivity of Jacob , and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel , and will be jealous for my holy name :
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	26	and they shall bear their confusion , and all their unfaithfulness in which they have acted unfaithfully against me , when they shall dwell safely in their land , and none shall make them afraid ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	27	when I have brought them again from the peoples , and gathered them out of their enemies ' lands , and am hallowed in them in the sight of many nations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	28	And they shall know that I [ am ] Jehovah their God , in that I caused them to be led into captivity among the nations , and have gathered them unto their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
DARBY	Ezekiel	39	29	And I will not hide my face any more from them , for I shall have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	40	And at the side without , at the ascent to the entry of the north gate , were two tables ; and on the other side , which was at the porch of the gate , were two tables :
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	2	In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me upon a very high mountain ; and upon it was as the building of a city , on the south .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	3	And he brought me thither , and behold , there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a flax-cord in his hand , and a measuring-reed ; and he stood in the gate .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	4	And the man said unto me , Son of man , behold with thine eyes , and hear with thine ears , and set thy heart upon all that I shall shew thee ; for in order that it might be shewn unto thee art thou brought hither . Declare to the house of Israel all that thou seest .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	5	And behold , there was a wall on the outside of the house round about , and in the man 's hand a measuring-reed of six cubits , [ each ] of one cubit and a hand breadth . And he measured the breadth of the building , one reed ; and the height , one reed .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	6	And he came to the gate which looked toward the east , and went up its steps ; and he measured the threshold of the gate , one reed broad ; and the other threshold one reed broad .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	7	And [ each ] chamber was one reed long and one reed broad ; and between the chambers were five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate , beside the porch of the gate within , was one reed .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	8	And he measured the porch of the gate within , one reed .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	9	And he measured the porch of the gate , eight cubits ; and the posts thereof , two cubits ; and the porch of the gate was inward .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	10	And the chambers of the gate which was toward the east were three on this side and three on that side : they three were of one measure ; and the posts on this side and on that side had one measure .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	11	And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate , ten cubits ; [ and ] the length of the gate , thirteen cubits .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	12	And there was a border before the chambers of one cubit , and a border of one cubit on the other side ; and the chambers were six cubits on this side , and six cubits on that side .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	13	And he measured the gate from the roof of [ one ] chamber to the roof [ of the other ] , a breadth of five and twenty cubits , entry opposite entry .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	14	And he made posts , sixty cubits , and by the post was the court of the gate round about .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	15	And from the front of the gate of the entrance unto the front of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	16	And there were closed windows to the chambers , and to their posts within the gate round about , and likewise to the projections ; and the windows round about were inward ; and upon [ each ] post were palm-trees .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	17	And he brought me into the outer court , and behold , there were cells , and a pavement made for the court round about : thirty cells were upon the pavement .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	18	And the pavement was by the side of the gates , answering to the length of the gates , [ namely ] the lower pavement .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	19	And he measured the breadth from the front of the lower gate unto the front of the inner court outside , a hundred cubits eastward and northward .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	20	And the gate of the outer court , that looked toward the north , he measured its length and its breadth .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	21	And its chambers were three on this side and three on that side ; and its posts and its projections were according to the measure of the first gate : its length was fifty cubits , and breadth five and twenty cubits .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	22	And its windows , and its projections , and its palm-trees were according to the measure of the gate that looked toward the east ; and they went up to it by seven steps ; and the projections thereof were before them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	23	And the gate of the inner court was opposite to the gate toward the north , and toward the east ; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	24	And he brought me toward the south : and behold , there was a gate toward the south ; and he measured its posts and its projections according to these measures .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	25	And there were windows to it and to its projections round about , like those windows : the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	26	And there were seven steps to go up to it ; and its projections were before them ; and it had palm-trees , one on this side and one on that side , upon its posts .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	27	And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south ; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south , a hundred cubits .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	28	And he brought me into the inner court by the south gate ; and he measured the south gate according to these measures :
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	29	and its chambers , and its posts , and its projections , according to these measures ; and there were windows to it and to its projections round about : the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth twenty-five cubits .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	30	And there were projections round about , twenty-five cubits long , and five cubits broad .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	31	And its projections were toward the outer court ; and there were palm-trees upon its posts : and its ascent was [ by ] eight steps .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	32	And he brought me into the inner court toward the east ; and he measured the gate according to these measures :
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	33	and its chambers , and its posts , and its projections , according to these measures ; and there were windows to it and to its projections round about : the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth twenty-five cubits .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	34	And its projections were toward the outer court ; and there were palm-trees upon its posts on this side and on that side : and its ascent was [ by ] eight steps .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	35	And he brought me to the north gate , and he measured [ it ] according to these measures :
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	36	its chambers , its posts , and its projections ; and there were windows to it round about : the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth twenty-five cubits .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	37	And its posts were toward the outer court ; and there were palm-trees upon its posts , on this side and on that side : and its ascent was [ by ] eight steps .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	38	And there was a cell and its entry by the posts of the gates ; there they rinsed the burnt-offering .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	39	And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side , and two tables on that side , to slay thereon the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	41	four tables on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate , —eight tables , whereon they slew [ the sacrifice ] ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	42	—and at the ascent , four tables of hewn stone , of a cubit and a half long , and a cubit and a half broad , and one cubit high ; whereon also they laid the instruments with which they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	43	And the double hooks of a hand breadth were fastened round about within ; and upon the tables [ they put ] the flesh of the offering .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	44	And outside the inner gate were two cells in the inner court , one at the side of the north gate , and its front towards the south ; the other was at the side of the south gate , the front towards the north .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	45	And he said unto me , This cell whose front is towards the south is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	46	And the cell whose front is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the altar . These are the sons of Zadok , those who , from among the sons of Levi , approach unto Jehovah to minister unto him .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	47	And he measured the court , the length a hundred cubits , and the breadth a hundred cubits , four square : and the altar was before the house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	48	And he brought me to the porch of the house ; and he measured the post of the porch , five cubits on this side , and five cubits on that side ; and the breadth of the gate , three cubits on this side , and three cubits on that side .
DARBY	Ezekiel	40	49	The length of the porch was twenty cubits , and the breadth eleven cubits , even by the steps whereby they went up to it ; and there were pillars by the posts , one on this side , and one on that side .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	41	And he brought me to the temple ; and he measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , the breadth of the tent .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	2	And the breadth of the entry was ten cubits , and the sides of the entry were five cubits on this side , and five cubits on that side ; and he measured its length , forty cubits , and the breadth , twenty cubits .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	3	And he went inwards , and measured the post of the entry , two cubits ; and the entry , six cubits ; and the breadth of the entry , seven cubits .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	4	And he measured its length , twenty cubits ; and the breadth , twenty cubits , before the temple : and he said unto me , This is the most holy [ place ] .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	5	And he measured the wall of the house , six cubits ; and the breadth of the side-chambers , four cubits , round about the house on every side .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	6	And the side-chambers were three , chamber over chamber , and thirty in order ; and they entered into the wall which the house had for the side-chambers round about , that they might have hold ; but they had not hold in the wall of the house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	7	And for the side-chambers there was an enlarging , and it went round about [ the house ] increasing upward ; for the surrounding of the house increased upward round about the house ; therefore the house had width upward , and so ascended [ from ] the lower [ story ] to the upper , by the middle one .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	8	And I saw that the house had an elevation round about : the foundations of the side-chambers , a full reed , six cubits to the joint .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	9	The thickness of the wall , which was for the side-chambers without , was five cubits , as also what was left free along the building of the side-chambers that pertained to the house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	10	And between the cells [ and the house ] was a width of twenty cubits round about the house on every side .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	11	And the entry of the side-chambers was toward what was left free , one entry toward the north , and one entry toward the south ; and the width of the space left free was five cubits round about .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	12	And the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad ; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about ; and its length ninety cubits .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	13	And he measured the house : the length a hundred cubits ; and the separate place , and the building , and its walls , the length a hundred cubits ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	14	and the breadth of the front of the house , and of the separate places toward the east , a hundred cubits .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	15	And he measured the length of the building before the separate place , which was at the back of it , with its galleries on the one side and on the other side , a hundred cubits ; and the inner temple , and the porches of the court .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	16	The thresholds , and the closed windows , and the galleries round about the three of them ( opposite the thresholds it was wainscoted with wood round about , and from the ground up to the windows , and the windows were covered ) ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	17	[ and ] above , over the entry , even unto the inner house , and without , and by all the wall round about , within and without , [ all was ] by measure .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	18	And it was made with cherubim and palm-trees , and a palm-tree was between cherub and cherub ; and the cherub had two faces :
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	19	the face of a man was toward the palm-tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the palm-tree on the other side : [ so ] was it made upon all the house round about .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	20	From the ground unto above the entry were the cherubim and the palm-trees made , and [ on ] the wall of the temple .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	21	As for the temple , the door-posts were squared ; and the front of the sanctuary had the same appearance .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	22	The altar was of wood , three cubits high , and its length two cubits ; and its corners , and its length , and its walls were of wood . And he said unto me , This is the table which is before Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	23	And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	24	And the doors had two leaves , two turning-leaves : two for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	25	And there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cherubim and palm-trees , as there were made upon the walls ; and there was a wooden portal in front of the porch without ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	41	26	and closed windows and palm-trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the porch and the side chambers of the house and the portals .
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	42	And he brought me forth into the outer court , the way toward the north ; and he brought me to the cells that were over against the separate place and which were over against the building , toward the north ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	2	before the length of the hundred cubits : the entry was on the north , and the breadth was fifty cubits ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	3	over against the twenty [ cubits ] that pertained to the inner court , and over against the pavement that pertained to the outer court ; there was gallery against gallery in the third [ story ] ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	4	and before the cells was a walk of ten cubits in breadth , [ and ] a way of a hundred cubits inward ; and their entries were toward the north .
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	5	And the upper cells , because the galleries encroached on them , were shorter than the lower , and than the middle-most of the building .
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	6	For they were in three [ stories ] , but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts ; therefore [ the third story ] was straitened more than the lowest and the middle-most from the ground .
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	7	And the wall that was without , answering to the cells , toward the outer court in the front of the cells , its length was fifty cubits :
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	8	for the length of the cells that were against the outer court was fifty cubits ; but behold , before the temple it was a hundred cubits .
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	9	And under these cells was the entry from the east , as one goeth into them from the outer court .
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	10	In the breadth of the wall of the court toward the south , before the separate place , and before the building , were cells ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	11	and a passage before them , like the appearance of the cells that were toward the north , according to their length , according to their breadth and all their goings out , and according to their fashions , and according to their doors .
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	12	And according to the doors of the cells that were toward the south there was a door at the head of the way , the way directly before the corresponding wall toward the east as one entereth into them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	13	And he said unto me , The north cells [ and ] the south cells , which are before the separate place , they are holy cells , where the priests that come near unto Jehovah shall eat the most holy things ; there shall they lay the most holy things , both the oblation and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering : for the place is holy .
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	14	When the priests enter in , they shall not go forth from the sanctuary into the outer court , but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister , for they are holy ; and they shall put on other garments , and shall approach to that which is for the people .
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	15	And when he had made an end of measuring the inner house , he brought me forth toward the gate whose front was toward the east , and measured [ the enclosure ] round about .
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	16	He measured the east side with the measuring-reed , five hundred reeds , with the measuring-reed round about .
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	17	He measured the north side , five hundred reeds , with the measuring-reed round about .
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	18	He measured the south side , five hundred reeds , with the measuring-reed .
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	19	He turned about to the west side , [ and ] measured five hundred reeds with the measuring-reed .
DARBY	Ezekiel	42	20	He measured it on the four sides ; it had a wall round about , five hundred long , and five hundred broad , to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	43	And he brought me unto the gate , the gate which looked toward the east .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	2	And behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east ; and his voice was like the voice of many waters ; and the earth was lit up with his glory .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	3	And the appearance of the vision that I saw was according to the vision that I had seen when I came to destroy the city ; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar : and I fell upon my face .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	4	And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by the way of the gate whose front was toward the east .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	5	And the Spirit lifted me up , and brought me into the inner court ; and behold , the glory of Jehovah filled the house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	6	And I heard one speaking unto me out of the house ; and a man was standing by me .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	7	And he said unto me , Son of man , [ this is ] the place of my throne , and the place of the soles of my feet , where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever ; and the house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name , they nor their kings , with their fornication , and with the carcases of their kings [ in ] their high places ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	8	in that they set their threshold by my threshold , and their post by my post , and [ there was only ] a wall between me and them , and they defiled my holy name with their abominations which they committed ; and I consumed them in mine anger .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	9	Now let them put away their fornication , and the carcases of their kings , far from me , and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	10	Thou , son of man , shew the house to the house of Israel , that they may be confounded at their iniquities ; and let them measure the pattern .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	11	And if they be confounded at all that they have done , make known to them the form of the house , and its fashion , and its goings out , and its comings in , and all its forms , and all its statutes , yea , all the forms thereof , and all the laws thereof ; and write it in their sight , that they may keep the whole form thereof , and all the statutes thereof , and do them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	12	This is the law of the house : Upon the top of the mountain all its border round about is most holy . Behold , this is the law of the house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	13	And these are the measures of the altar in cubits : the cubit is a cubit and a hand breadth . The bottom was a cubit [ in height ] and the breadth a cubit , and its border on the edge thereof round about , one span : and this was the base of the altar .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	14	And from the bottom upon the ground to the lower settle was two cubits , and the breadth one cubit ; and from the small settle to the great settle , four cubits , and the breadth a cubit .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	15	And the upper altar was four cubits ; and from the hearth of God and upward were four horns .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	16	And the hearth of God was twelve [ cubits ] long , by twelve broad , square in the four sides thereof .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	17	And the settle was fourteen [ cubits ] long by fourteen broad in the four sides thereof ; and the border about it , half a cubit ; and the bottom thereof a cubit round about : and its steps looked toward the east .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	18	And he said unto me , Son of man , thus saith the Lord Jehovah : These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it , to offer up burnt-offerings thereon , and to sprinkle blood thereon .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	19	And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that are of the seed of Zadok , who come near unto me , to minister unto me , saith the Lord Jehovah , a young bullock for a sin-offering .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	20	And thou shalt take of its blood , and put it on the four horns thereof , and on the four corners of the settle , and upon the border round about : so shalt thou purge and make atonement for it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	21	And thou shalt take the bullock of the sin-offering , and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house , outside the sanctuary .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	22	And on the second day thou shalt present a he-goat without blemish for a sin-offering ; and they shall purge the altar , as they purged it with the bullock .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	23	When thou hast ended purging it , thou shalt present a young bullock without blemish , and a ram out of the flock without blemish ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	24	and thou shalt present them before Jehovah ; and the priests shall cast salt upon them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt-offering unto Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	25	Seven days shalt thou offer daily a goat for a sin-offering ; they shall also offer a young bullock , and a ram out of the flock without blemish .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	26	Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it , and consecrate it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	43	27	And when these days are ended , it shall be that upon the eighth day and onwards the priests shall offer your burnt-offerings upon the altar , and your peace-offerings ; and I will accept you , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	44	And he brought me back toward the outer gate of the sanctuary which looked toward the east ; and it was shut .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	2	And Jehovah said unto me , This gate shall be shut ; it shall not be opened , and no one shall enter in by it : for Jehovah , the God of Israel , hath entered in by it ; and it shall be shut .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	3	As for the prince , he , the prince , shall sit in it to eat bread before Jehovah : he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	4	And he brought me the way of the north gate before the house ; and I beheld , and lo , the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah : and I fell upon my face .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	5	And Jehovah said unto me , Son of man , apply thy heart , and behold with thine eyes , and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the statutes of the house of Jehovah , and all the laws thereof ; and mark well the entering in of the house , with every going forth of the sanctuary ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	6	and say to the rebellious , to the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Let it suffice you of all your abominations , O house of Israel ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	7	in that ye have brought strangers , uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh , to be in my sanctuary , to profane it , [ even ] my house , when ye offered my bread , the fat and the blood ; and they have broken my covenant besides all your abominations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	8	And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things , but have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	9	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : No stranger , uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh , shall enter into my sanctuary , of any stranger that is among the children of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	10	But the Levites who went away far from me , when Israel went astray , going astray from me after their idols , they shall even bear their iniquity ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	11	but they shall be ministers in my sanctuary , having oversight at the gates of the house , and doing the service of the house : they shall slaughter the burnt-offering and the sacrifice for the people , and they shall stand before them to minister unto them .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	12	Because they ministered unto them before their idols , and were unto the house of Israel a stumbling-block of iniquity ; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them , saith the Lord Jehovah , that they shall bear their iniquity .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	13	And they shall not draw near unto me , to do the office of a priest unto me , nor to draw near to any of my holy things , [ even ] to the most holy ; but they shall bear their confusion , and their abominations which they have committed .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	14	And I will make them keepers of the charge of the house , for all the service thereof , and for all that shall be done therein .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	15	But the priests , the Levites , the sons of Zadok , that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me , they shall approach unto me to minister unto me , and they shall stand before me to present unto me the fat and the blood , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	16	They shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall approach unto my table , to minister unto me , and they shall keep my charge .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	17	And it shall come to pass when they enter in at the gates of the inner court , they shall be clothed with linen garments ; and no wool shall come upon them , when they minister in the gates of the inner court , and towards the house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	18	They shall have linen tires upon their heads , and shall have linen breeches upon their loins ; they shall not gird on anything that causeth sweat .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	19	And when they go forth into the outer court , into the outer court to the people , they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered , and lay them in the holy cells ; and they shall put on other garments , that they may not hallow the people with their garments .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	20	Neither shall they shave their heads , nor suffer their locks to grow long : they shall duly poll their heads .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	21	Neither shall any priest drink wine when they enter into the inner court .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	22	And they shall not take for their wives a widow , nor her that is put away ; but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of Israel , or a widow that is the widow of a priest .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	23	And they shall teach my people [ the difference ] between holy and profane , and cause them to discern between unclean and clean .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	24	And in controversy they shall stand to judge : they shall judge it according to my judgments ; and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my solemnities ; and they shall hallow my sabbaths .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	25	And they shall come at no dead person to become unclean ; but for father , or for mother , or for son , or for daughter , for brother , or for sister that hath had no husband , they may become unclean .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	26	And after he is cleansed , they shall count unto him seven days .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	27	And on the day that he goeth into the sanctuary , unto the inner court , to minister in the sanctuary , he shall present his sin-offering , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	28	And it shall be unto them for an inheritance ; I am their inheritance : and ye shall give them no possession in Israel ; I am their possession .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	29	They shall eat the oblation and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering ; and every devoted thing in Israel shall be theirs .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	30	And the first of all the first-fruits of every [ kind ] , and every heave-offering of every [ kind ] , of all your heave-offerings , shall be for the priests ; ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough , that he may cause the blessing to rest on thy house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	44	31	The priests shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself , or of that which is torn , whether of fowl or of beast .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	45	And when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance , ye shall offer a heave-offering unto Jehovah , a holy portion of the land : the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand [ cubits ] , and the breadth ten thousand . This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	2	Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred [ reeds ] by five hundred , square round about ; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	3	And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand , and the breadth of ten thousand ; and in it shall be the sanctuary , the holy of holies .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	4	This is the holy [ portion ] of the land ; it shall be for the priests who do the service of the sanctuary , who draw near to serve Jehovah , and it shall be a place for their houses , and a holy place for the sanctuary .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	5	And [ a space of ] five and twenty thousand in length , and ten thousand in breadth , shall the Levites , who do the service of the house , have for themselves , for a possession , for their habitations .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	6	And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand in breadth , and five and twenty thousand in length , alongside of the holy heave-offering : it shall be for the whole house of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	7	And the prince shall have [ his portion ] on the one side and on the other side of the holy heave-offering and of the possession of the city , over against the holy heave-offering , and over against the possession of the city , from the west side westward , and from the east side eastward ; and in length answering to one of the portions [ of the tribes ] from the west border unto the east border .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	8	As land shall it be his for a possession in Israel ; and my princes shall no more oppress my people ; but they shall give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	9	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : Let it suffice you , princes of Israel ! Put away violence and spoil , and execute judgment and justice ; take off your exactions from my people , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	10	Ye shall have just balances , and a just ephah , and a just bath .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	11	The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , so that the bath may contain the tenth part of a homer , and the ephah the tenth part of a homer : the measure thereof shall be according to the homer .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	12	And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs ; twenty shekels , five and twenty shekels , fifteen shekels , shall be your maneh .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	13	This is the heave-offering which ye shall offer : the sixth part of an ephah out of a homer of wheat , and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah out of a homer of barley ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	14	and the set portion of oil , by the bath of oil , the tenth part of a bath out of a cor , [ which is ] a homer of ten baths , for ten baths are a homer ;
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	15	and one lamb out of the flock , out of two hundred , from the well-watered pastures of Israel ; —for an oblation , and for a burnt-offering , and for peace-offerings , to make atonement for them , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	16	All the people of the land shall be [ held ] to this heave-offering for the prince in Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	17	And it shall be the prince 's part [ to supply ] the burnt-offerings , and the oblation , and the drink-offering , at the feasts , and at the new moons , and on the sabbaths , in all the solemnities of the house of Israel : it is he that shall prepare the sin-offering , and the oblation , and the burnt-offering , and the peace-offerings , to make atonement for the house of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	18	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : In the first [ month ] , on the first of the month , thou shalt take a young bullock , without blemish , and thou shalt purge the sanctuary .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	19	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin-offering , and put it upon the posts of the house , and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar , and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	20	So thou shalt do also on the seventh of the month for every one that erreth , and for the simple ; and ye shall make atonement for the house .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	21	In the first [ month ] , on the fourteenth day of the month , ye shall have the passover , a feast of seven days : unleavened bread shall be eaten .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	22	And upon that day shall the prince offer for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin-offering .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	23	And the seven days of the feast he shall offer a burnt-offering to Jehovah , seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish daily for the seven days ; and a he-goat daily for a sin-offering .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	24	And he shall offer an oblation of an ephah for a bullock , and an ephah for a ram ; and oil , a hin for an ephah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	45	25	In the seventh [ month ] , on the fifteenth day of the month , at the feast , shall he do the like seven days , according to the sin-offering , according to the burnt-offering , and according to the oblation , and according to the oil .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	46	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working-days ; but on the sabbath-day it shall be opened , and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	2	And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of [ that ] gate from without , and shall stand by the post of the gate , and the priests shall offer his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings , and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate , and shall go forth : but the gate shall not be shut until the evening .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	3	And the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before Jehovah on the sabbaths and on the new moons .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	4	And the burnt-offering that the prince shall present unto Jehovah on the sabbath-day shall be six lambs without blemish , and a ram without blemish .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	5	And the oblation shall be an ephah for a ram , and the oblation for the lambs as he shall be able to give ; and oil , a hin for an ephah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	6	And on the day of the new moon , a young bullock without blemish , and six lambs , and a ram : they shall be without blemish .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	7	And he shall offer an oblation , an ephah for the bullock , and an ephah for the ram , and for the lambs according to what his hand may attain unto ; and oil , a hin for an ephah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	8	And when the prince cometh in , he shall come in by the way of the porch of the gate , and he shall go out by the way thereof .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	9	And when the people of the land come in before Jehovah in the set feasts , he that cometh in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate ; and he that cometh in by the way of the south gate shall go out by the way of the north gate : he shall not return by the way of the gate by which he came in , but shall go out straight before him .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	10	And the prince shall come in in the midst of them , when they come in ; and when they go out , they shall go out [ together ] .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	11	And on the feast-days , and in the solemnities , the oblation shall be an ephah for a bullock and an ephah for a ram , and for the lambs as he is able to give ; and oil , a hin for an ephah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	12	And when the prince shall offer a voluntary burnt-offering or voluntary peace-offerings unto Jehovah , the gate that looketh toward the east shall be opened for him and he shall offer his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings as he did on the sabbath-day , and he shall go out again , and the gate shall be shut after he hath gone out .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	13	And thou shalt daily offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah , of a yearling-lamb without blemish : thou shalt prepare it morning by morning .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	14	And thou shalt prepare an oblation with it every morning , the sixth part of an ephah , and of oil the third part of a hin , to moisten the fine flour : an oblation unto Jehovah continually by a perpetual ordinance .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	15	They shall offer the lamb , and the oblation , and the oil , every morning for a continual burnt-offering .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	16	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons , it shall be that one 's inheritance , for his sons : it shall be their possession by inheritance .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	17	But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants , it shall be his until the year of liberty ; and it shall return to the prince : to his sons alone shall his inheritance remain .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	18	And the prince shall not take of the people 's inheritance , to thrust them by oppression out of their possession : he shall give his sons an inheritance out of his own possession : that my people be not scattered every one from his possession .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	19	Then he brought me through the passage which was at the side of the gate , into the holy cells which were for the priests , which looked toward the north ; and behold , a place was there at the end westward .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	20	And he said unto me , This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offering , and the sin-offering , [ and ] where they shall bake the oblation , that they bring them not out into the outer court , so as to hallow the people .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	21	And he brought me forth into the outer court , and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court ; and behold , in every corner of the court there was a court .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	22	In the four corners of the court there were enclosed courts , forty [ cubits ] long and thirty broad : these four corner courts were of one measure .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	23	And there was a row [ of building ] round about in them , round about those four , and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about .
DARBY	Ezekiel	46	24	And he said unto me , These are the boiling-houses , where those who do the service of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	47	And he brought me back to the door of the house ; and behold , waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward : for the front of the house was eastward . And the waters came down from under , from the right side of the house , south of the altar .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	2	And he brought me out by the way of the gate northward , and led me round outside unto the outer gate towards [ the gate ] that looketh eastward ; and behold , waters ran out on the right side .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	3	When the man went forth eastward , a line was in his hand ; and he measured a thousand cubits , and he caused me to pass through the waters : the waters were to the ankles .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	4	And he measured a thousand [ cubits ] , and caused me to pass through the waters : the waters were to the knees . And he measured a thousand and caused me to pass through : the waters were to the loins .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	5	And he measured a thousand : it was a river that I could not pass through , for the waters were risen , waters to swim in , a river that could not be passed through .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	6	And he said unto me , Son of man , hast thou seen [ this ] ? And he led me , and brought me back to the bank of the river .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	7	When I returned , behold , on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	8	And he said unto me , These waters issue out toward the east district , and go down into the plain , and go into the sea ; when they are brought forth into the sea , the waters [ thereof ] shall be healed .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	9	And it shall come to pass that every living thing which moveth , whithersoever the double river shall come , shall live . And there shall be a very great multitude of fish ; for these waters shall come thither , and [ the waters of the sea ] shall be healed ; and everything shall live whither the river cometh .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	10	And it shall come to pass , that fishers shall stand upon it ; from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim shall be [ a place ] to spread forth nets : their fish shall be according to their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	11	But its marshes and its pools shall not be healed ; they shall be given up to salt .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	12	And by the river , upon its bank , on the one side and on the other , shall grow all trees for food , whose leaf shall not fade , nor their fruit fail : it shall bring forth new fruit every month , for its waters issue out of the sanctuary ; and the fruit thereof shall be for food , and the leaf thereof for medicine .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	13	Thus saith the Lord Jehovah : This shall be the border whereby ye shall allot the land as inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel : Joseph [ shall have two ] portions .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	14	And ye shall inherit it , one as well as another , [ the land ] concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it unto your fathers ; and this land shall fall to you for inheritance .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	15	And this shall be the border of the land : toward the north side , from the great sea , the way of Hethlon , as one goeth to Zedad ,
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	16	Hamath , Berothah , Sibraim , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath ; Hazer-hatticon , which is by the border of Hauran .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	17	And the border from the sea shall be Hazar-enan , the border of Damascus , and the north northward , and the border of Hamath : this is the north side .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	18	—And on the east side ye shall measure between Hauran and Damascus , and Gilead and the land of Israel [ by ] the Jordan , from the border unto the east sea : this is the east side .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	19	—And the south side southward , from Tamar to the waters of Meribah-Kadesh , by the torrent , unto the great sea : this is the south side southward .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	20	—And the west side shall be the great sea from the border , as far as over against the entering into Hamath : this is the west side .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	21	And ye shall divide this land unto you according to the tribes of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	22	And it shall come to pass that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you , and to the strangers that sojourn among you , who shall beget children among you ; and they shall be unto you as the home-born among the children of Israel : with you shall they draw by lot inheritance among the tribes of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	47	23	And it shall come to pass that in the tribe in which the stranger sojourneth , there shall ye give [ him ] his inheritance , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	48	And these are the names of the tribes : From the north end along the way of Hethlon , as one entereth into Hamath , Hazar-enan , the border of Damascus northward unto near Hamath—the east and west side [ belonging ] to him—shall Dan have one [ portion ] .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	2	And by the border of Dan , from the east side unto the west side , Asher one .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	3	And by the border of Asher , from the east side even unto the west side , Naphtali one .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	4	And by the border of Naphtali , from the east side unto the west side , Manasseh one .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	5	And by the border of Manasseh , from the east side unto the west side , Ephraim one .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	6	And by the border of Ephraim , from the east side even unto the west side , Reuben one .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	7	And by the border of Reuben , from the east side unto the west side , Judah one .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	8	And by the border of Judah , from the east side unto the west side , shall be the heave-offering that ye shall offer , five and twenty thousand [ cubits ] in breadth , and in length as one of the parts from the east side unto the west side : and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	9	The heave-offering that ye shall offer unto Jehovah shall be five and twenty thousand in length , and ten thousand in breadth .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	10	And for them , for the priests , shall be the holy heave-offering , toward the north five and twenty thousand , and toward the west the breadth ten thousand , and toward the east the breadth ten thousand , and toward the south the length five and twenty thousand : and the sanctuary of Jehovah shall be in the midst of it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	11	[ It shall be ] for the priests that are hallowed of the sons of Zadok , who kept my charge and went not astray when the children of Israel went astray , as the Levites went astray .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	12	And this offering heaved from the heave-offering of the land shall be unto them a thing most holy , by the border of the Levites .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	13	And answering to the border of the priests , the Levites shall have five and twenty thousand in length , and ten thousand in breadth : the whole length shall be five and twenty thousand , and the breadth ten thousand .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	14	And they shall not sell of it , neither exchange , nor alienate the first-fruits of the land : for it is holy unto Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	15	And the five thousand that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand , shall be a common [ place ] for the city , for dwellings and for suburbs : and the city shall be in the midst of it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	16	And these shall be the measures thereof : the north side four thousand and five hundred [ cubits ] , and the south side four thousand and five hundred , and the east side four thousand and five hundred , and the west side four thousand and five hundred .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	17	And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty [ cubits ] , and toward the south two hundred and fifty , and toward the east two hundred and fifty , and toward the west two hundred and fifty .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	18	And the residue in length , alongside the holy heave-offering , shall be ten thousand eastward and ten thousand westward : it shall be alongside the holy heave-offering ; and the increase thereof shall be for the support of them that serve the city .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	19	And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the tribes of Israel .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	20	The whole heave-offering shall be five and twenty thousand by five and twenty thousand ; ye shall offer the holy heave-offering foursquare with the possession of the city .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	21	And the rest shall be for the prince , on the one side and on the other of the holy heave-offering and of the possession of the city , in front of the five and twenty thousand of the heave-offering toward the east border , and westward in front of the five and twenty thousand toward the west border , answering to the [ other ] portions : it shall be for the prince ; and the holy heave-offering and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst of it .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	22	And from the possession of the Levites and from the possession of the city , being in the midst of that which shall be the prince 's , between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin , shall be for the prince .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	23	And as for the rest of the tribes : from the east side unto the west side , Benjamin one [ portion ] .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	24	And by the border of Benjamin , from the east side unto the west side , Simeon one .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	25	And by the border of Simeon , from the east side unto the west side , Issachar one .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	26	And by the border of Issachar , from the east side unto the west side , Zebulun one .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	27	And by the border of Zebulun , from the east side unto the west side , Gad one .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	28	And by the border of Gad , at the south side southward , the border shall be from Tamar [ to ] the waters of Meribah-Kadesh , by the torrent , unto the great sea .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	29	This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance , and these are their portions , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	30	And these are the goings out of the city . On the north side , four thousand and five hundred [ cubits ] by measure .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	31	And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel : three gates northward : the gate of Reuben , one ; the gate of Judah , one ; the gate of Levi , one .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	32	And at the east side four thousand and five hundred , and three gates : the gate of Joseph , one ; the gate of Benjamin , one ; the gate of Dan , one .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	33	And at the south side four thousand and five hundred [ cubits ] by measure , and three gates : the gate of Simeon , one ; the gate of Issachar , one ; the gate of Zebulun , one .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	34	At the west side four thousand and five hundred , [ and ] their three gates : the gate of Gad , one ; the gate of Asher , one ; the gate of Naphtali , one .
DARBY	Ezekiel	48	35	Round about it was eighteen thousand [ cubits ] ; and the name of the city from that day , Jehovah is there .
DARBY	Daniel	1	1	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem , and besieged it .
DARBY	Daniel	1	2	And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand , and a part of the vessels of the house of God ; and he carried them into the land of Shinar , to the house of his god ; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god .
DARBY	Daniel	1	3	And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz the chief of his eunuchs , that he should bring of the children of Israel , both of the royal seed and of the nobles ,
DARBY	Daniel	1	4	youths in whom was no blemish , and of goodly countenance , and skilful in all wisdom , and acquainted with knowledge , and understanding science , and such as had ability in them to stand in the king 's palace , and whom they might teach the learning and the language of the Chaldeans .
DARBY	Daniel	1	5	And the king appointed unto them a daily provision of the king 's delicate food , and of the wine that he drank , to nourish them three years , that at the end thereof they might stand before the king .
DARBY	Daniel	1	6	Now among these were of the children of Judah , Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah .
DARBY	Daniel	1	7	And the prince of the eunuchs gave them names : to Daniel he gave [ the name ] Belteshazzar , and to Hananiah , Shadrach , and to Mishael , Meshach , and to Azariah , Abed-nego .
DARBY	Daniel	1	8	And Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not pollute himself with the king 's delicate food , nor with the wine which he drank ; and he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not have to pollute himself .
DARBY	Daniel	1	9	And God granted Daniel favour and mercy before the prince of the eunuchs .
DARBY	Daniel	1	10	And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel , I fear my lord the king who hath appointed your food and your drink ; for why should he see your faces worse liking than the youths who are of your age ? and ye would endanger my head with the king .
DARBY	Daniel	1	11	And Daniel said to the steward , whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah ,
DARBY	Daniel	1	12	Prove thy servants , I beseech thee , ten days ; and let them give us pulse to eat , and water to drink ;
DARBY	Daniel	1	13	then let our countenances be looked upon before thee , and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king 's delicate food : and as thou shalt see , deal with thy servants .
DARBY	Daniel	1	14	And he hearkened unto them in this matter , and proved them ten days .
DARBY	Daniel	1	15	And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and were fatter in flesh than all the youths that ate of the king 's delicate food .
DARBY	Daniel	1	16	So the steward took away their delicate food , and the wine that they should drink ; and gave them pulse .
DARBY	Daniel	1	17	As for these four youths , God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom ; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams .
DARBY	Daniel	1	18	And at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in , the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar .
DARBY	Daniel	1	19	And the king spoke with them ; and among them all was found none like Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah : and they stood before the king .
DARBY	Daniel	1	20	And in all matters of judicious wisdom , as to which the king enquired of them , he found them ten times better than all the scribes [ and ] magicians that were in all his realm .
DARBY	Daniel	1	21	And Daniel continued unto the first year of king Cyrus .
DARBY	Daniel	2	2	And the king commanded to call the scribes , and the magicians , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans , to shew the king his dreams ; and they came and stood before the king .
DARBY	Daniel	2	3	And the king said unto them , I have dreamed a dream , and my spirit is troubled to know the dream .
DARBY	Daniel	2	4	And the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic , O king , live for ever ! tell thy servants the dream , and we will shew the interpretation .
DARBY	Daniel	2	5	The king answered and said to the Chaldeans , The command is gone forth from me : If ye do not make known unto me the dream , and its interpretation , ye shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a dunghill .
DARBY	Daniel	2	6	But if ye shew the dream and its interpretation , ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour ; therefore shew me the dream and its interpretation .
DARBY	Daniel	2	7	They answered the second time and said , Let the king tell his servants the dream , and we will shew the interpretation .
DARBY	Daniel	2	8	The king answered and said , I know of a certainty that ye would gain time , because ye see the word is gone forth from me ;
DARBY	Daniel	2	9	but if ye do not make known unto me the dream , there is but one decree for you ; for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me , till the time be changed : therefore tell me the dream , and I shall know that ye can shew me its interpretation .
DARBY	Daniel	2	10	The Chaldeans answered before the king and said , There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king 's matter ; therefore there is no king , however great and powerful , that hath asked such a thing of any scribe , or magician , or Chaldean .
DARBY	Daniel	2	11	For the thing that the king demandeth is extraordinary , and there is none other that can shew it before the king , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
DARBY	Daniel	2	12	For this cause the king was irritated and very wroth , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
DARBY	Daniel	2	13	And the decree went forth that the wise men were to be slain ; and they sought Daniel and his companions to slay them .
DARBY	Daniel	2	14	Then Daniel answered with counsel and prudence to Arioch the chief of the king 's bodyguard , who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon :
DARBY	Daniel	2	15	he answered and said to Arioch the king 's captain , Why is the decree so rigorous from the king ? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel .
DARBY	Daniel	2	16	And Daniel went in , and requested of the king that he would give him time , that he might shew the king the interpretation .
DARBY	Daniel	2	17	Then Daniel went to his house , and made the thing known to Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah , his companions ;
DARBY	Daniel	2	18	that they would desire mercies of the God of the heavens concerning this secret ; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
DARBY	Daniel	2	19	Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision . Then Daniel blessed the God of the heavens .
DARBY	Daniel	2	20	Daniel answered and said , Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever ; For wisdom and might are his .
DARBY	Daniel	2	21	And it is he that changeth times and seasons ; He deposeth kings , and setteth up kings ; He giveth wisdom to the wise , And knowledge to them that know understanding .
DARBY	Daniel	2	22	It is he that revealeth the deep and secret things ; He knoweth what is in the darkness , and the light dwelleth with him .
DARBY	Daniel	2	23	I thank thee , and I praise thee , O God of my fathers , Who hast given me wisdom and might , And hast made known unto me already what we desired of thee ; For thou hast made known unto us the king 's matter .
DARBY	Daniel	2	24	Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch , whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon ; he went and said thus unto him : Destroy not the wise men of Babylon ; bring me in before the king , and I will shew unto the king the interpretation .
DARBY	Daniel	2	25	Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste , and said thus unto him : I have found a man of the sons of the captivity of Judah that will make known unto the king the interpretation .
DARBY	Daniel	2	26	The king answered and said unto Daniel , whose name was Belteshazzar , Art thou able to make known unto me the dream that I have seen , and its interpretation ?
DARBY	Daniel	2	27	Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said , The secret that the king hath demanded can not the wise men , the magicians , the scribes , the astrologers , shew unto the king ;
DARBY	Daniel	2	28	but there is a God in the heavens , who revealeth secrets , and maketh known to king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be at the end of days . Thy dream , and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are these :
DARBY	Daniel	2	29	—as for thee , O king , thy thoughts arose upon thy bed , what should come to pass hereafter ; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass .
DARBY	Daniel	2	30	And as for me , this secret is revealed to me , not by [ any ] wisdom that I have more than any living , but to the intent that the interpretation should be made known to the king , and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart .
DARBY	Daniel	2	31	Thou , O king , sawest , and behold , a great image . This image was mighty and its brightness excellent ; it stood before thee , and its appearance was terrible .
DARBY	Daniel	2	32	This image 's head was of fine gold , its breast and its arms of silver , its belly and its thighs of brass ,
DARBY	Daniel	2	33	its legs of iron , its feet part of iron and part of clay .
DARBY	Daniel	2	34	Thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands ; and it smote the image upon its feet of iron and clay , and broke them to pieces .
DARBY	Daniel	2	35	Then was the iron , the clay , the brass , the silver , and the gold broken in pieces together , and they became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors ; and the wind carried them away , and no place was found for them . And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain , and filled the whole earth .
DARBY	Daniel	2	36	This is the dream ; and we will tell the interpretation of it before the king .
DARBY	Daniel	2	37	Thou , O king , art a king of kings , unto whom the God of the heavens hath given the kingdom , the power , and the strength , and the glory ;
DARBY	Daniel	2	38	and wheresoever the children of men , the beasts of the field , and the fowl of the heavens dwell , he hath given them into thy hand , and hath made thee ruler over them all : thou art this head of gold .
DARBY	Daniel	2	39	And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee ; then another third kingdom of brass , which shall bear rule over all the earth .
DARBY	Daniel	2	40	And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron : forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth everything , and as iron that breaketh all these , so shall it break in pieces and bruise .
DARBY	Daniel	2	41	And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes , part of potter 's clay , and part of iron , the kingdom shall be divided ; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron , forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay .
DARBY	Daniel	2	42	And [ as ] the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay , the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile .
DARBY	Daniel	2	43	And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay , they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men ; but they shall not cleave one to another , even as iron doth not mingle with clay .
DARBY	Daniel	2	44	And in the days of these kings shall the God of the heavens set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed ; and the sovereignty thereof shall not be left to another people : it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms , but itself shall stand for ever .
DARBY	Daniel	2	45	Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands , and that it broke in pieces the iron , the brass , the clay , the silver , and the gold , —the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter . And the dream is certain , and the interpretation of it sure .
DARBY	Daniel	2	46	Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and worshipped Daniel , and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him .
DARBY	Daniel	2	47	The king answered Daniel and said , Of a truth it is that your God is the God of gods , and the Lord of kings , and a revealer of secrets , because thou wast able to reveal this secret .
DARBY	Daniel	2	48	Then the king made Daniel great , and gave him many great gifts , and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon , and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon .
DARBY	Daniel	2	49	And Daniel requested of the king , and he appointed Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon . And Daniel was in the gate of the king .
DARBY	Daniel	3	3	Then the satraps , the prefects , and the governors , the judges , the treasurers , the counsellors , the justices , and all the rulers of the provinces , were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up ; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up .
DARBY	Daniel	3	2	And Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps , the prefects , and the governors , the judges , the treasurers , the counsellors , the justices , and all the rulers of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
DARBY	Daniel	3	4	And the herald cried aloud , To you it is commanded , [ O ] peoples , nations , and languages ,
DARBY	Daniel	3	5	that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet , pipe , lute , sambuca , psaltery , bagpipe , and all kinds of music , ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up ;
DARBY	Daniel	3	6	and whosoever doth not fall down and worship shall that same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
DARBY	Daniel	3	7	Therefore at that time when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet , pipe , lute , sambuca , psaltery , and all kinds of music , all the peoples , the nations , and the languages fell down [ and ] worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up .
DARBY	Daniel	3	8	Whereupon at that time certain Chaldeans came near , and accused the Jews .
DARBY	Daniel	3	9	They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar , O king , live for ever !
DARBY	Daniel	3	10	Thou , O king , hast made a decree , that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet , pipe , lute , sambuca , psaltery , and bagpipe , and all kinds of music , shall fall down and worship the golden image ;
DARBY	Daniel	3	11	and [ that ] whosoever doth not fall down and worship , shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace .
DARBY	Daniel	3	12	There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon : Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego : these men , O king , regard thee not ; they serve not thy gods , nor worship the golden image that thou hast set up .
DARBY	Daniel	3	13	Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego . Then were these men brought before the king .
DARBY	Daniel	3	14	Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them , Is it of purpose , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego , that ye serve not my god , nor worship the golden image that I have set up ?
DARBY	Daniel	3	15	Now if ye be ready at the time that ye hear the sound of the cornet , pipe , lute , sambuca , psaltery , and bagpipe , and all kinds of music , to fall down and worship the image that I have made , [ well ] : but if ye worship not , ye shall be cast that same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace : and who is the God that shall deliver you out of my hands ?
DARBY	Daniel	3	16	Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego answered and said to the king , O Nebuchadnezzar , we have no need to answer thee in this matter .
DARBY	Daniel	3	17	If it be [ so ] , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace , and he will deliver [ us ] out of thy hand , O king .
DARBY	Daniel	3	18	But if not , be it known unto thee , O king , that we will not serve thy gods , nor worship the golden image that thou hast set up .
DARBY	Daniel	3	19	Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury , and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego . He spoke , and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated .
DARBY	Daniel	3	20	And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego , and cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
DARBY	Daniel	3	21	Then these men were bound in their hosen , their tunics , and their cloaks , and their garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
DARBY	Daniel	3	22	Forasmuch as the king 's commandment was rigorous , and the furnace exceeding hot , the flame of the fire slew those men that had taken up Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego .
DARBY	Daniel	3	23	And these three men , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego , fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
DARBY	Daniel	3	24	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied , and rose up in haste ; he spoke and said unto his counsellors , Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? They answered and said to the king , True , O king .
DARBY	Daniel	3	25	He answered and said , Lo , I see four men loose , walking in the midst of the fire , and they have no hurt ; and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of God .
DARBY	Daniel	3	26	Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the opening of the burning fiery furnace ; he spoke and said , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego , ye servants of the Most High God , come forth , and come [ hither ] . Then Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego came forth from the midst of the fire .
DARBY	Daniel	3	27	And the satraps , the prefects , and the governors , and the king 's counsellors , being gathered together , saw these men , upon whose bodies the fire had had no power , nor was the hair of their head singed , neither were their hosen changed , nor had the smell of fire passed on them .
DARBY	Daniel	3	28	Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said , Blessed be the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego , who hath sent his angel , and delivered his servants who trusted in him , and who changed the king 's word , and yielded their bodies , that they might not serve nor worship any god , except their own God !
DARBY	Daniel	3	29	Therefore I make a decree , that in every people , nation , and language , he who shall speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego , shall be cut in pieces , and his house shall be made a dunghill : because there is no other God that is able to deliver after this sort .
DARBY	Daniel	3	30	Then the king promoted Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego in the province of Babylon .
DARBY	Daniel	4	4	I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house , and flourishing in my palace .
DARBY	Daniel	4	2	It hath seemed good unto me to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God hath wrought toward me .
DARBY	Daniel	4	3	How great are his signs ! and how mighty are his wonders ! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and his dominion is from generation to generation .
DARBY	Daniel	4	5	I saw a dream which made me afraid , and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me .
DARBY	Daniel	4	6	And I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream .
DARBY	Daniel	4	7	Then came in the scribes , the magicians , the Chaldeans , and the astrologers ; and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation of it .
DARBY	Daniel	4	8	But at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name is Belteshazzar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods ; and before him I told the dream :
DARBY	Daniel	4	9	O Belteshazzar , master of the scribes , because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee , and no secret is too hard for thee , tell me the visions of my dream which I have seen , and the interpretation of it .
DARBY	Daniel	4	10	Thus were the visions of my head upon my bed : I saw , and behold a tree in the midst of the earth , and its height was great .
DARBY	Daniel	4	11	The tree grew , and was strong , and its height reached unto the heavens , and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth .
DARBY	Daniel	4	12	Its leaves were beautiful , and its fruit abundant , and in it was food for all : the beasts of the field found shade under it , and the birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches , and all flesh was fed from it .
DARBY	Daniel	4	13	I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed , and behold , a watcher and a holy one came down from the heavens ;
DARBY	Daniel	4	14	he cried aloud , and said thus : Hew down the tree , and cut off its branches , shake off its leaves , and scatter its fruit ; let the beasts get away from under it , and the birds from its branches .
DARBY	Daniel	4	15	Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth , even with a band of iron and brass , in the tender grass of the field ; and let it be bathed with the dew of heaven , and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth .
DARBY	Daniel	4	16	Let his heart be changed from man 's , and let a beast 's heart be given unto him ; and let seven times pass over him .
DARBY	Daniel	4	17	This sentence is by the decree of the watchers , and the decision by the word of the holy ones : that the living may know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men , and giveth it to whomsoever he will , and setteth up over it the basest of men .
DARBY	Daniel	4	18	This dream I , king Nebuchadnezzar , have seen ; and thou , Belteshazzar , tell the interpretation , forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation ; but thou art able , for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee .
DARBY	Daniel	4	19	Then Daniel , whose name is Belteshazzar , was astonied for one hour , and his thoughts troubled him . The king spoke and said , Belteshazzar , let not the dream , nor its interpretation , trouble thee . Belteshazzar answered and said , My lord , the dream be to them that hate thee , and its interpretation to thine enemies !
DARBY	Daniel	4	20	The tree that thou sawest , which grew and was strong , whose height reached unto the heavens , and the sight of it to all the earth ;
DARBY	Daniel	4	21	whose leaves were beautiful , and its fruit abundant , and in it was food for all ; under which the beasts of the field dwelt , and in whose branches the birds of the heavens had their habitation :
DARBY	Daniel	4	22	it is thou , O king , who art grown and become strong ; for thy greatness is grown , and reacheth unto the heavens , and thy dominion to the end of the earth .
DARBY	Daniel	4	23	And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from the heavens , and saying , Hew the tree down , and destroy it ; nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth , even with a band of iron and brass , in the tender grass of the field ; and let it be bathed with the dew of heaven , and let his portion be with the beasts of the field , till seven times pass over him :
DARBY	Daniel	4	24	this is the interpretation , O king , and it is the decree of the Most High , which cometh upon my lord the king :
DARBY	Daniel	4	25	They shall drive thee from men , and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field , and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen , and thou shalt be bathed with the dew of heaven ; and seven times shall pass over thee , till thou know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men , and giveth it to whomsoever he will .
DARBY	Daniel	4	26	And whereas it was commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree ; thy kingdom shall remain unto thee , after that thou shalt know that the heavens do rule .
DARBY	Daniel	4	27	Therefore , O king , let my counsel be acceptable unto thee , and break off thy sins by righteousness , and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor ; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity .
DARBY	Daniel	4	28	All this came upon king Nebuchadnezzar .
DARBY	Daniel	4	29	At the end of twelve months he was walking upon the royal palace of Babylon :
DARBY	Daniel	4	30	the king spoke and said , Is not this great Babylon , that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty ?
DARBY	Daniel	4	31	While the word was in the king 's mouth , there fell a voice from the heavens : King Nebuchadnezzar , to thee it is spoken : The kingdom is departed from thee ;
DARBY	Daniel	4	32	and they shall drive thee from men , and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field ; they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen , and seven times shall pass over thee , until thou know that the Most High ruleth over the kingdom of men , and giveth it to whomsoever he will .
DARBY	Daniel	4	33	The same hour was the word fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar ; and he was driven from men , and ate grass as oxen ; and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven , till his hair grew like eagles ' [ feathers ] , and his nails like birds ' [ claws ] .
DARBY	Daniel	4	34	And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto the heavens , and mine understanding returned unto me , and I blessed the Most High , and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever , whose dominion is an everlasting dominion , and his kingdom is from generation to generation .
DARBY	Daniel	4	35	And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing ; and he doeth according to his will in the army of the heavens , and among the inhabitants of the earth ; and none can stay his hand , or say unto him , What doest thou ?
DARBY	Daniel	4	36	At the same time mine understanding returned unto me ; and for the glory of my kingdom , my majesty and brightness returned unto me ; and my counsellors and my nobles sought me ; and I was established in my kingdom , and excellent greatness was added unto me .
DARBY	Daniel	4	37	Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of the heavens , all whose works are truth , and his paths judgment : and those that walk in pride he is able to abase .
DARBY	Daniel	5	5	In the same hour came forth fingers of a man 's hand , and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king 's palace : and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote .
DARBY	Daniel	5	2	Belshazzar , while he tasted the wine , commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem ; that the king and his nobles , his wives and his concubines , might drink in them .
DARBY	Daniel	5	3	Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem ; and the king and his nobles , his wives and his concubines , drank in them .
DARBY	Daniel	5	4	They drank wine , and praised the gods of gold and of silver , of brass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
DARBY	Daniel	5	6	Then the king 's countenance was changed , and his thoughts troubled him , and the joints of his loins were loosed , and his knees smote one against another .
DARBY	Daniel	5	7	The king cried aloud to bring in the magicians , the Chaldeans , and the astrologers . The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon , Whosoever shall read this writing , and shew me the interpretation thereof , shall be clothed with purple , and have a chain of gold about his neck , and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom .
DARBY	Daniel	5	8	Then came in all the king 's wise men , but they could not read the writing , nor make known to the king the interpretation .
DARBY	Daniel	5	9	Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled , and his countenance was changed in him , and his nobles were confounded .
DARBY	Daniel	5	10	—The queen , by reason of the words of the king and his nobles , came into the banquet-house . The queen spoke and said , O king , live for ever ! let not thy thoughts trouble thee , neither let thy countenance be changed .
DARBY	Daniel	5	11	There is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods ; and in the days of thy father , light and understanding and wisdom , like the wisdom of the gods was found in him ; and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father , [ even ] the king thy father , made him master of the scribes , magicians , Chaldeans , [ and ] astrologers ;
DARBY	Daniel	5	12	forasmuch as an excellent spirit , and knowledge , and understanding , interpreting of dreams , and shewing of hard sentences , and solving of problems , were found in the same Daniel , whom the king named Belteshazzar . Now let Daniel be called , and he will shew the interpretation .
DARBY	Daniel	5	13	Then was Daniel brought in before the king . The king spoke and said unto Daniel , Art thou that Daniel , of the children of the captivity of Judah , whom the king my father brought out of Judah ?
DARBY	Daniel	5	14	And I have heard of thee , that the spirit of the gods is in thee , and [ that ] light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee .
DARBY	Daniel	5	15	And now the wise men , the magicians , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing , and make known unto me the interpretation thereof ; but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing .
DARBY	Daniel	5	16	But I have heard of thee , that thou canst give interpretations , and solve problems . Now if thou canst read the writing , and make known to me the interpretation thereof , thou shalt be clothed with purple , and have a chain of gold about thy neck , and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom .
DARBY	Daniel	5	17	Then Daniel answered and said before the king , Let thy gifts be to thyself , and give thy rewards to another ; yet will I read the writing to the king , and make known to him the interpretation .
DARBY	Daniel	5	18	O thou king , the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom , and greatness , and glory , and majesty ;
DARBY	Daniel	5	19	and for the greatness that he gave him , all peoples , nations , and languages , trembled and feared before him : whom he would he slew , and whom he would he kept alive ; and whom he would he exalted , and whom he would he humbled .
DARBY	Daniel	5	20	But when his heart was lifted up , and his spirit hardened unto presumption , he was deposed from the throne of his kingdom , and they took his glory from him ;
DARBY	Daniel	5	21	and he was driven from the sons of men , and his heart was made like the beasts , and his dwelling was with the wild asses ; they fed him with grass like oxen , and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven ; till he knew that the Most High God ruleth over the kingdom of men , and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will .
DARBY	Daniel	5	22	And thou , Belshazzar , his son , hast not humbled thy heart , although thou knewest all this ;
DARBY	Daniel	5	23	but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of the heavens ; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee , and thou and thy nobles , thy wives and thy concubines , have drunk wine in them ; and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold , of brass , iron , wood , and stone , which see not , nor hear , nor know ; and the God in whose hand thy breath is , and whose are all thy ways , hast thou not glorified :
DARBY	Daniel	5	24	then from before him was sent the part of the hand , and this writing hath been written .
DARBY	Daniel	5	25	And this is the writing that is written : MENE , MENE , TEKEL , UPHARSIN .
DARBY	Daniel	5	26	This is the interpretation of the thing : MENE , God hath numbered thy kingdom , and finished it ;
DARBY	Daniel	5	27	TEKEL , Thou art weighed in the balances , and art found wanting ;
DARBY	Daniel	5	28	PERES , Thy kingdom is divided , and given to the Medes and Persians .
DARBY	Daniel	5	29	Then Belshazzar commanded , and they clothed Daniel with purple , and [ put ] a chain of gold about his neck , and made proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom .
DARBY	Daniel	5	30	In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain .
DARBY	Daniel	5	31	And Darius the Mede received the kingdom , [ being ] about sixty-two years old .
DARBY	Daniel	6	6	Then these presidents and satraps came in a body to the king , and said thus unto him : King Darius , live for ever !
DARBY	Daniel	6	2	and over these , three presidents—of whom Daniel was one—to whom these satraps should render account , and that the king should suffer no loss .
DARBY	Daniel	6	3	Now this Daniel surpassed the presidents and the satraps , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to appoint him over the whole realm .
DARBY	Daniel	6	4	Then the presidents and the satraps sought to find a pretext against Daniel with respect to the kingdom ; but they could not find any pretext or fault ; inasmuch as he was faithful , neither was there any error or fault found in him .
DARBY	Daniel	6	5	Then said these men , We shall not find any pretext against this Daniel , unless we find [ it ] against him touching the law of his God .
DARBY	Daniel	6	7	All the presidents of the kingdom , the prefects , and the satraps , the counsellors , and the governors have consulted together to establish a royal statute , and to make a firm decree , that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days , except of thee , O king , he shall be cast into the den of lions .
DARBY	Daniel	6	8	Now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it be not changed , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which may not be revoked .
DARBY	Daniel	6	9	Therefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree .
DARBY	Daniel	6	10	And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed , he went into his house ; and , his windows being open in his upper chamber toward Jerusalem , he kneeled on his knees three times a day , and prayed and gave thanks before his God , as he did aforetime .
DARBY	Daniel	6	11	But those men came in a body , and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God .
DARBY	Daniel	6	12	Then they came near , and spoke before the king concerning the king 's decree : Hast thou not signed a decree , that every man that shall ask [ anything ] of any god or man within thirty days , except of thee , O king , shall be cast into the den of lions ? The king answered and said , The thing is true , according to the law of the Medes and Persians , which may not be revoked .
DARBY	Daniel	6	13	Then they answered and said before the king , That Daniel , who is of the children of the captivity of Judah , regardeth not thee , O king , nor the decree that thou hast signed , but maketh his petition three times a day .
DARBY	Daniel	6	14	Then the king , when he heard these words , was sore distressed thereby , and set his heart on Daniel to save him ; and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him .
DARBY	Daniel	6	15	Then these men came in a body unto the king , and said unto the king , Know , O king , that the law of the Medes and Persians is , That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed .
DARBY	Daniel	6	16	Then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast [ him ] into the den of lions . The king spoke and said unto Daniel , Thy God whom thou servest continually , he will save thee .
DARBY	Daniel	6	17	And a stone was brought , and laid upon the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own signet , and with the signet of his nobles , that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel .
DARBY	Daniel	6	18	Then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fasting ; neither were concubines brought before him ; and his sleep fled from him .
DARBY	Daniel	6	19	Then the king arose with the light at break of day , and went in haste unto the den of lions .
DARBY	Daniel	6	20	And when he came near unto the den , he cried with a mournful voice unto Daniel : the king spoke and said unto Daniel , O Daniel , servant of the living God , hath thy God whom thou servest continually been able to save thee from the lions ?
DARBY	Daniel	6	21	Then Daniel spoke unto the king , O king , live for ever !
DARBY	Daniel	6	22	My God hath sent his angel , and hath shut the lions ' mouths , that they have not hurt me ; forasmuch as before him innocence was found in me ; and also before thee , O king , have I done no hurt .
DARBY	Daniel	6	23	Thereupon was the king exceeding glad , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . So Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no manner of hurt was found upon him , because he believed in his God .
DARBY	Daniel	6	24	And the king commanded , and they brought those men who had accused Daniel , and cast them into the den of lions , them , their children , and their wives ; and the lions had the mastery of them , and broke all their bones in pieces ere they came to the bottom of the den .
DARBY	Daniel	6	25	Then king Darius wrote unto all peoples , nations , and languages , that dwell in all the earth : Peace be multiplied unto you .
DARBY	Daniel	6	26	I make a decree , That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel ; for he is the living God , and steadfast for ever , and his kingdom [ that ] which shall not be destroyed , and his dominion shall be even unto the end .
DARBY	Daniel	6	27	He saveth and delivereth , and he worketh signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth : who hath saved Daniel from the power of the lions .
DARBY	Daniel	6	28	And this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius , and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian .
DARBY	Daniel	7	7	After this I saw in the night visions , and behold , a fourth beast , dreadful and terrible , and exceeding strong ; and it had great iron teeth : it devoured and broke in pieces , and stamped the rest with its feet ; and it was different from all the beasts that were before it ; and it had ten horns .
DARBY	Daniel	7	2	Daniel spoke and said , I saw in my vision by night , and behold , the four winds of the heavens broke forth upon the great sea .
DARBY	Daniel	7	3	And four great beasts came up from the sea , different one from another .
DARBY	Daniel	7	4	The first was like a lion , and had eagle 's wings : I beheld till its wings were plucked ; and it was lifted up from the earth , and made to stand upon two feet as a man , and a man 's heart was given to it .
DARBY	Daniel	7	5	And behold , another beast , a second , like unto a bear , and it raised up itself on one side ; and [ it had ] three ribs in its mouth between its teeth ; and they said thus unto it : Arise , devour much flesh .
DARBY	Daniel	7	6	After this I saw , and behold , another , like a leopard , and it had four wings of a bird upon its back ; and the beast had four heads ; and dominion was given to it .
DARBY	Daniel	7	8	I considered the horns , and behold , there came up among them another , a little horn , before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots ; and behold , in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man , and a mouth speaking great things .
DARBY	Daniel	7	9	I beheld till thrones were set , and the Ancient of days did sit : his raiment was white as snow , and the hair of his head like pure wool ; his throne was flames of fire , [ and ] its wheels burning fire .
DARBY	Daniel	7	10	A stream of fire issued and came forth from before him ; thousand thousands ministered unto him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
DARBY	Daniel	7	11	I beheld therefore , because of the voice of the great words that the horn spoke ; I beheld till the beast was slain , and its body destroyed , and it was given up to be burned with fire .
DARBY	Daniel	7	12	As for the rest of the beasts , their dominion was taken away ; but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time .
DARBY	Daniel	7	13	I saw in the night visions , and behold , there came with the clouds of heaven [ one ] like a son of man , and he came up even to the Ancient of days , and they brought him near before him .
DARBY	Daniel	7	14	And there was given him dominion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all peoples , nations , and languages should serve him : his dominion is an everlasting dominion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom [ that ] which shall not be destroyed .
DARBY	Daniel	7	15	As for me Daniel , my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
DARBY	Daniel	7	16	I came near unto one of them that stood by , and asked him the certainty of all this . And he told me , and made me know the interpretation of the things :
DARBY	Daniel	7	17	These great beasts , which are four , are four kings , [ that ] shall arise out of the earth .
DARBY	Daniel	7	18	But the saints of the most high [ places ] shall receive the kingdom , and they shall possess the kingdom for ever , even to the ages of ages .
DARBY	Daniel	7	19	Then I desired to know the certainty concerning the fourth beast , which was different from them all , exceeding dreadful , whose teeth were of iron , and its nails of brass ; which devoured , broke in pieces , and stamped the rest with its feet ;
DARBY	Daniel	7	20	and concerning the ten horns that were in its head , and the other that came up , and before which three fell : even that horn that had eyes , and a mouth speaking great things , and whose look was more imposing than its fellows .
DARBY	Daniel	7	21	I beheld , and that horn made war with the saints , and prevailed over them ;
DARBY	Daniel	7	22	until the Ancient of days came , and judgment was given to the saints of the most high [ places ] ; and the appointed time arrived , and the saints possessed the kingdom .
DARBY	Daniel	7	23	He said thus : The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon the earth , which shall be different from all the kingdoms , and shall devour the whole earth , and shall tread it down , and break it in pieces .
DARBY	Daniel	7	24	And as to the ten horns , out of this kingdom shall arise ten kings ; and another shall arise after them ; and he shall be different from the former , and he shall subdue three kings .
DARBY	Daniel	7	25	And he shall speak words against the Most High , and shall wear out the saints of the most high [ places ] , and think to change seasons and the law ; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and a half time .
DARBY	Daniel	7	26	And the judgment shall sit , and they shall take away his dominion , to consume and to destroy it unto the end .
DARBY	Daniel	7	27	But the kingdom and the dominion , and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heavens , shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high [ places ] . His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and all dominions shall serve and obey him .
DARBY	Daniel	7	28	So far is the end of the matter . As for me Daniel , my thoughts much troubled me , and my countenance was changed in me ; but I kept the matter in my heart .
DARBY	Daniel	8	8	And the he-goat became exceeding great ; but when he was become strong , the great horn was broken ; and in its stead came up four notable ones toward the four winds of the heavens .
DARBY	Daniel	8	2	And I saw in the vision ; and it came to pass , when I saw , that I was in the fortress of Shushan , which is in the province of Elam . And I saw in the vision , and I was by the river Ulai .
DARBY	Daniel	8	3	And I lifted up mine eyes and saw , and behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns ; and the two horns were high ; and one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
DARBY	Daniel	8	4	I saw the ram pushing westward , and northward , and southward , and no beast could stand before him , neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand ; and he did according to his will , and became great .
DARBY	Daniel	8	5	And as I was considering , behold , a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth , and touched not the ground : and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes .
DARBY	Daniel	8	6	And he came to the ram that had the two horns , which I had seen standing before the river , and ran upon him in the fury of his power .
DARBY	Daniel	8	7	And I saw him come close to the ram , and he was enraged with him , and smote the ram , and broke his two horns ; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him ; and he cast him down to the ground , and trampled upon him ; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand .
DARBY	Daniel	8	9	And out of one of them came forth a little horn , which became exceeding great , toward the south , and toward the east , and toward the beauty [ of the earth ] .
DARBY	Daniel	8	10	And it became great , even to the host of heaven ; and it cast down [ some ] of the host and of the stars to the ground , and trampled upon them .
DARBY	Daniel	8	11	( And he magnified [ himself ] even to the prince of the host , and from him the continual [ sacrifice ] was taken away , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down .
DARBY	Daniel	8	12	And a time of trial was appointed unto the continual [ sacrifice ] by reason of transgression . ) And it cast down the truth to the ground ; and it practised and prospered .
DARBY	Daniel	8	13	And I heard one saint speaking , and another saint said unto that one who spoke , How long shall be the vision of the continual [ sacrifice ] and of the transgression that maketh desolate , to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden down under foot ?
DARBY	Daniel	8	14	And he said unto me , Until two thousand and three hundred evenings [ and ] mornings : then shall the sanctuary be vindicated .
DARBY	Daniel	8	15	And it came to pass , when I Daniel had seen the vision , I sought for the understanding of it , and behold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
DARBY	Daniel	8	16	And I heard a man 's voice between [ the banks of ] the Ulai ; and he called and said , Gabriel , make this [ man ] to understand the vision .
DARBY	Daniel	8	17	And he came near where I stood ; and when he came , I was afraid , and fell on my face ; and he said unto me , Understand , son of man ; for the vision is for the time of the end .
DARBY	Daniel	8	18	Now , as he was speaking with me , I was in a deep stupor , with my face toward the ground . And he touched me , and set me up where I had stood .
DARBY	Daniel	8	19	And he said , Behold , I will make thee know what shall be at the end of the indignation : for at the set time the end shall be .
DARBY	Daniel	8	20	The ram that thou sawest having the two horns : they are the kings of Media and Persia .
DARBY	Daniel	8	21	And the rough goat is the king of Greece ; and the great horn that was between his eyes is the first king .
DARBY	Daniel	8	22	Now that being broken , whereas four stood up in its stead , four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation , but not with his power .
DARBY	Daniel	8	23	And at the latter time of their kingdom , when the transgressors shall have come to the full , a king of bold countenance , and understanding riddles , shall stand up .
DARBY	Daniel	8	24	And his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power ; and he shall destroy marvellously , and shall prosper , and shall practise , and shall destroy the mighty ones , and the people of the saints .
DARBY	Daniel	8	25	And through his cunning shall he cause craft to prosper in his hand ; and he will magnify [ himself ] in his heart , and by prosperity will corrupt many ; and he will stand up against the Prince of princes : but he shall be broken without hand .
DARBY	Daniel	8	26	And the vision of the evening and the morning which hath been told is true ; but close thou up the vision , for it is for many days [ to come ] .
DARBY	Daniel	8	27	And I Daniel fainted , and was sick [ certain ] days : then I rose up , and did the king 's business . And I was astonished at the vision , but none understood [ it ] .
DARBY	Daniel	9	9	With the Lord our God are mercies and pardons , for we have rebelled against him ;
DARBY	Daniel	9	2	in the first year of his reign , I Daniel understood by the books that the number of the years , whereof the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the prophet , for the accomplishment of the desolations of Jerusalem , was seventy years .
DARBY	Daniel	9	3	And I set my face unto the Lord God , to seek by prayer and supplications , with fasting , and sackcloth , and ashes ;
DARBY	Daniel	9	4	and I prayed unto Jehovah my God , and made my confession , and said , Alas Lord ! the great and terrible God , keeping covenant and loving-kindness with them that love him , and that keep his commandments :
DARBY	Daniel	9	5	we have sinned , and have committed iniquity , and have done wickedly , and have rebelled , even turning aside from thy commandments and from thine ordinances .
DARBY	Daniel	9	6	And we have not hearkened unto thy servants the prophets , who spoke in thy name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
DARBY	Daniel	9	7	Thine , O Lord , is the righteousness , but unto us confusion of face , as at this day , to the men of Judah , and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and unto all Israel , that are near , and that are far off , in all the countries whither thou hast driven them , because of their unfaithfulness in which they have been unfaithful against thee .
DARBY	Daniel	9	8	O Lord , unto us is confusion of face , to our kings , to our princes , and to our fathers , because we have sinned against thee .
DARBY	Daniel	9	10	and we have not hearkened unto the voice of Jehovah our God , to walk in his laws , which he set before us through his servants the prophets .
DARBY	Daniel	9	11	And all Israel have transgressed thy law , even turning aside so as not to listen unto thy voice . And the curse hath been poured out upon us , and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God : for we have sinned against him .
DARBY	Daniel	9	12	And he hath performed his words , which he spoke against us , and against our judges that judged us , by bringing upon us a great evil ; so that there hath not been done under the whole heaven as hath been done upon Jerusalem .
DARBY	Daniel	9	13	As it is written in the law of Moses , all this evil is come upon us ; yet we besought not Jehovah our God , that we might turn from our iniquities , and understand thy truth .
DARBY	Daniel	9	14	And Jehovah hath watched over the evil , and brought it upon us ; for Jehovah our God is righteous in all his works which he hath done ; and we have not hearkened unto his voice .
DARBY	Daniel	9	15	—And now , O Lord our God , who broughtest thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand , and hast made thee a name , as it is this day , —we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
DARBY	Daniel	9	16	Lord , according to all thy righteousnesses , I beseech thee , let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem , thy holy mountain ; for because of our sins , and because of the iniquities of our fathers , Jerusalem and thy people [ are become ] a reproach to all round about us .
DARBY	Daniel	9	17	And now , our God , hearken to the prayer of thy servant , and to his supplications , and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate , for the Lord 's sake .
DARBY	Daniel	9	18	Incline thine ear , O my God , and hear ; open thine eyes and behold our desolations , and the city that is called by thy name : for we do not present our supplications before thee because of our righteousnesses , but because of thy manifold mercies .
DARBY	Daniel	9	19	Lord , hear ! Lord , forgive ! Lord , hearken and do ! defer not , for thine own sake , O my God ! for thy city and thy people are called by thy name .
DARBY	Daniel	9	20	And whilst I was speaking , and praying , and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel , and presenting my supplication before Jehovah my God for the holy mountain of my God ;
DARBY	Daniel	9	21	whilst I was yet speaking in prayer , the man Gabriel , whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning , flying swiftly , touched me about the time of the evening oblation .
DARBY	Daniel	9	22	And he informed [ me ] , and talked with me , and said , Daniel , I am now come forth to make thee skilful of understanding .
DARBY	Daniel	9	23	At the beginning of thy supplications the word went forth , and I am come to declare [ it ] ; for thou art one greatly beloved . Therefore consider the word , and have understanding in the vision :
DARBY	Daniel	9	24	Seventy weeks are apportioned out upon thy people and upon thy holy city , to close the transgression , and to make an end of sins , and to make expiation for iniquity , and to bring in the righteousness of the ages , and to seal the vision and prophet , and to anoint the holy of holies .
DARBY	Daniel	9	25	Know therefore and understand : From the going forth of the word to restore and to build Jerusalem unto Messiah , the Prince , are seven weeks , and sixty-two weeks . The street and the moat shall be built again , even in troublous times .
DARBY	Daniel	9	26	And after the sixty-two weeks shall Messiah be cut off , and shall have nothing ; and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary ; and the end thereof shall be with an overflow , and unto the end , war , —the desolations determined .
DARBY	Daniel	9	27	And he shall confirm a covenant with the many [ for ] one week ; and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease , and because of the protection of abominations [ there shall be ] a desolator , even until that the consumption and what is determined shall be poured out upon the desolate .
DARBY	Daniel	10	10	And behold , a hand touched me , which set me upon my knees and the palms of my hands .
DARBY	Daniel	10	2	In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks :
DARBY	Daniel	10	3	I ate no pleasant bread , neither came flesh nor wine into my mouth , neither did I anoint myself at all , till three full weeks were fulfilled .
DARBY	Daniel	10	4	And on the four-and-twentieth day of the first month , I was by the side of the great river , which is Hiddekel :
DARBY	Daniel	10	5	and I lifted up mine eyes and looked , and behold , a certain man clothed in linen , and his loins were girded with pure gold of Uphaz ;
DARBY	Daniel	10	6	and his body was like a chrysolite , and his face as the appearance of lightning , and his eyes as torches of fire , and his arms and his feet as the look of burnished brass , and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude .
DARBY	Daniel	10	7	And I Daniel alone saw the vision ; and the men that were with me saw not the vision , but a great quaking fell on them , and they fled to hide themselves .
DARBY	Daniel	10	8	And I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me ; and my comeliness was turned in me into corruption , and I retained no strength .
DARBY	Daniel	10	9	And I heard the voice of his words ; and when I heard the voice of his words , I fell into a deep stupor on my face , and my face to the ground .
DARBY	Daniel	10	11	And he said unto me , O Daniel , man greatly beloved , understand the words which I speak unto thee , and stand upright ; for unto thee am I now sent . And as he spoke this word unto me , I stood trembling .
DARBY	Daniel	10	12	And he said unto me , Fear not , Daniel ; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand , and to humble thyself before thy God , thy words were heard , and I am come because of thy words .
DARBY	Daniel	10	13	But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days ; and behold , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me ; and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
DARBY	Daniel	10	14	And I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people at the end of the days : for the vision is yet for [ many ] days .
DARBY	Daniel	10	15	And as he was speaking with me according to these words , I set my face toward the ground , and I became dumb .
DARBY	Daniel	10	16	And behold , one after the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips ; and I opened my mouth and spoke , and said unto him that stood before me , My lord , by reason of the vision my pains are turned upon me , and I retain no strength .
DARBY	Daniel	10	17	And how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , straightway there remaineth no strength in me , neither is there breath left in me .
DARBY	Daniel	10	18	Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man , and he strengthened me ;
DARBY	Daniel	10	19	and he said , Fear not , man greatly beloved ; peace be unto thee , be strong , yea , be strong . And as he was speaking with me I was strengthened , and I said , Let my lord speak ; for thou hast strengthened me .
DARBY	Daniel	10	20	And he said , Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee ? And now I return to fight with the prince of Persia ; and when I go forth , behold , the prince of Greece shall come .
DARBY	Daniel	10	21	However , I will declare unto thee that which is set down in the scripture of truth ; and there is not one that sheweth himself strong with me against these , but Michael your prince .
DARBY	Daniel	11	11	And the king of the south shall be enraged , and shall come forth and fight with him , with the king of the north , who shall set forth a great multitude , but the multitude shall be given into his hand .
DARBY	Daniel	11	2	And now will I declare unto thee the truth . Behold , there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia ; and the fourth shall enrich himself with great riches more than all ; and when he hath become strong through his riches , he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece .
DARBY	Daniel	11	3	And a mighty king shall stand up that shall rule with great dominion , and do according to his will .
DARBY	Daniel	11	4	And when he shall stand up , his kingdom shall be broken , and shall be divided toward the four winds of the heavens ; but not to his posterity , nor according to his dominion wherewith he ruled ; for his kingdom shall be plucked up , even for others beside these .
DARBY	Daniel	11	5	And the king of the south , who is one of his princes , shall be strong ; but [ another ] shall be stronger than he , and have dominion : his dominion shall be a great dominion .
DARBY	Daniel	11	6	And after the course of years they shall join affinity ; and the king 's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make equitable conditions : but she shall not retain the strength of her arm ; neither shall he stand , nor his arm ; and she shall be given up , she and they that brought her , and he that begat her , and he that strengthened her in [ those ] times .
DARBY	Daniel	11	7	But out of a shoot from her roots shall one stand up in his place , who shall come to the army , and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north , and shall deal against them , and shew himself mighty .
DARBY	Daniel	11	8	He shall also carry captive into Egypt their gods , with their princes , and their precious vessels of silver and of gold ; and he shall subsist for more years than the king of the north ;
DARBY	Daniel	11	9	and [ the same ] shall come into the realm of the king of the south , but shall return into his own land .
DARBY	Daniel	11	10	And his sons shall be stirred up , and shall assemble a multitude of great forces ; and one shall certainly come , and overflow , and pass through ; and he shall return and carry the war even to his fortress .
DARBY	Daniel	11	12	And when the multitude shall have been taken away , his heart shall be exalted ; and he shall cast down myriads ; but he shall not prevail .
DARBY	Daniel	11	13	For the king of the north shall return , and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former ; and shall certainly come at the end of the times of years with a great army and with much substance .
DARBY	Daniel	11	14	And in those times shall many stand up against the king of the south ; and the violent of thy people will exalt themselves to establish the vision ; but they shall fall .
DARBY	Daniel	11	15	And the king of the north shall come , and cast up a mound , and take the well-fenced city ; and the arms of the south shall not withstand , neither his chosen people , for there shall be no strength to withstand .
DARBY	Daniel	11	16	And he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will , and none shall stand before him ; and he shall stand in the land of beauty , and destruction shall be in his hand .
DARBY	Daniel	11	17	And he shall set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom , and upright ones with him ; and he shall practise ; and he shall give him the daughter of women , to corrupt her ; but she shall not stand , neither shall she be for him .
DARBY	Daniel	11	18	And he shall turn his face unto the isles , and shall take many ; but a captain for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease : he shall turn it upon him , without reproach for himself .
DARBY	Daniel	11	19	And he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land ; and he shall stumble and fall , and not be found .
DARBY	Daniel	11	20	And in his place shall one stand up who shall cause the exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom ; but in a few days he shall be broken , neither in anger nor in battle .
DARBY	Daniel	11	21	And in his place shall stand up a vile person , to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom ; but he shall come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries .
DARBY	Daniel	11	22	And the overflowing forces shall be overflowed from before him , and shall be broken : yea , also the prince of the covenant .
DARBY	Daniel	11	23	And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully , and he shall come up , and shall become strong with a small people .
DARBY	Daniel	11	24	In time of peace shall he enter even into the fattest places of the province ; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done , nor his fathers ' fathers : he shall scatter among them prey , and spoil , and substance , and he shall plan his devices against the fortified places , even for a time .
DARBY	Daniel	11	25	And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army ; and the king of the south shall engage in battle with an exceeding great and mighty army ; but he shall not stand , for they shall plan devices against him .
DARBY	Daniel	11	26	And they that eat of his delicate food shall break him , and his army shall be dissolved ; and many shall fall down slain .
DARBY	Daniel	11	27	And both these kings ' hearts [ shall meditate ] mischief , and they shall speak lies at one table ; but it shall not prosper ; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .
DARBY	Daniel	11	28	And he shall return into his land with great substance ; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant ; and he shall practise , and return to his own land .
DARBY	Daniel	11	29	At the set time he shall return , and come towards the south ; but not as the former time shall be the latter ;
DARBY	Daniel	11	30	for ships of Chittim shall come against him ; and he shall be grieved , and return , and have indignation against the holy covenant ; and will practise ; and he shall return and direct his attention to those that forsake the holy covenant .
DARBY	Daniel	11	31	And forces shall stand on his part , and they shall profane the sanctuary , the fortress , and shall take away the continual [ sacrifice ] , and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate .
DARBY	Daniel	11	32	And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he pervert by flatteries ; but the people that know their God shall be strong , and shall act .
DARBY	Daniel	11	33	And they that are wise among the people shall instruct the many ; and they shall fall by the sword , and by flame , by captivity , and by spoil , [ many ] days .
DARBY	Daniel	11	34	And when they fall , they shall be helped with a little help ; but many shall cleave to them with flatteries .
DARBY	Daniel	11	35	And [ some ] of the wise shall fall , to try them , and to purge and to make them white , to the time of the end : for it shall yet be for the time appointed .
DARBY	Daniel	11	36	And the king shall do according to his will ; and he shall exalt himself , and magnify himself above every god , and speak monstrous things against the God of gods ; and he shall prosper until the indignation be accomplished : for that which is determined shall be done .
DARBY	Daniel	11	37	And he will not regard the God of his fathers , nor the desire of women ; nor regard any +god : for he will magnify himself above all .
DARBY	Daniel	11	38	And in his place will he honour the +god of fortresses ; and a +god whom his fathers knew not will he honour with gold and silver , and with precious stones and pleasant things .
DARBY	Daniel	11	39	And he will practise in the strongholds of fortresses with a strange +god : whoso acknowledgeth him will he increase with glory ; and he shall cause them to rule over the many , and shall divide the land [ to them ] for a reward .
DARBY	Daniel	11	40	And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him ; and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind , with chariots , and with horsemen , and with many ships ; and he shall enter into the countries , and overflow and pass through .
DARBY	Daniel	11	41	And he shall enter into the land of beauty , and many [ countries ] shall be overthrown ; but these shall escape out of his hand : Edom , and Moab , and the chief of the children of Ammon .
DARBY	Daniel	11	42	And he shall stretch forth his hand upon the countries ; and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
DARBY	Daniel	11	43	And he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver , and over all the precious things of Egypt ; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps .
DARBY	Daniel	11	44	But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him ; and he shall go forth with great fury to exterminate , and utterly to destroy many .
DARBY	Daniel	11	45	And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the mountain of holy beauty ; and he shall come to his end , and there shall be none to help him .
DARBY	Daniel	12	12	Blessed is he that waiteth , and cometh to the thousand three hundred and thirty-five days !
DARBY	Daniel	12	2	And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame , to everlasting contempt .
DARBY	Daniel	12	3	And they that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the expanse ; and they that turn the many to righteousness as the stars , for ever and ever .
DARBY	Daniel	12	4	And thou , Daniel , close the words , and seal the book , till the time of the end . Many shall run to and fro , and knowledge shall be increased .
DARBY	Daniel	12	5	And I Daniel looked , and behold , there stood other two , the one on this side , on the bank of the river , and the other on that side , on the bank of the river .
DARBY	Daniel	12	6	And he said to the man clothed in linen , who was above the waters of the river , How long [ is it to ] the end of these wonders ?
DARBY	Daniel	12	7	And I heard the man clothed in linen , who was above the waters of the river ; and he held up his right hand and his left hand unto the heavens , and swore by him that liveth for ever that it is for a time , times , and a half ; and when the scattering of the power of the holy people shall be accomplished , all these things shall be finished .
DARBY	Daniel	12	8	And I heard , but I understood not . And I said , My lord , what shall be the end of these things ?
DARBY	Daniel	12	9	And he said , Go thy way , Daniel ; for these words are closed and sealed till the time of the end .
DARBY	Daniel	12	10	Many shall be purified , and be made white , and be refined ; but the wicked shall do wickedly : and none of the wicked shall understand ; but the wise shall understand .
DARBY	Daniel	12	11	And from the time that the continual [ sacrifice ] is taken away , and the abomination that maketh desolate set up , [ there shall be ] a thousand , two hundred , and ninety days .
DARBY	Daniel	12	13	But do thou go thy way until the end ; and thou shalt rest , and stand in thy lot at the end of the days .
DARBY	Hosea	1	1	The word of Jehovah that came unto Hosea , the son of Beeri , in the days of Uzziah , Jotham , Ahaz , Hezekiah , kings of Judah , and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel .
DARBY	Hosea	1	2	The beginning of the word of Jehovah through Hosea . And Jehovah said to Hosea , Go , take unto thee a wife of whoredoms , and children of whoredoms ; for the land is entirely given up to whoredom , away from Jehovah .
DARBY	Hosea	1	3	And he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim ; and she conceived and bore him a son .
DARBY	Hosea	1	4	And Jehovah said unto him , Call his name Jizreel ; for yet a little , and I will visit the blood of Jizreel upon the house of Jehu , and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease .
DARBY	Hosea	1	5	And it shall come to pass in that day , that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jizreel .
DARBY	Hosea	1	6	And she conceived again , and bore a daughter . And he said unto him , Call her name Lo-ruhamah ; for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel , so that I should pardon them .
DARBY	Hosea	1	7	But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah , and will save them by Jehovah their God ; and I will not save them by bow , or by sword , or by battle , [ or ] by horses , or by horsemen .
DARBY	Hosea	1	8	And she weaned Lo-ruhamah ; and she conceived and bore a son ;
DARBY	Hosea	1	9	and he said , Call his name Lo-ammi ; for ye are not my people , and I will not be for you .
DARBY	Hosea	1	10	Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea which can not be measured or numbered ; and it shall come to pass , [ that ] in the place where it was said unto them , Ye are not my people , it shall be said unto them , Sons of the living God .
DARBY	Hosea	1	11	And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together , and they shall appoint themselves one head , and shall go up out of the land : for great is the day of Jizreel .
DARBY	Hosea	2	2	Plead with your mother , plead ; for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband : and let her put away her whoredoms from her face , and her adulteries from between her breasts ;
DARBY	Hosea	2	3	lest I strip her naked , and set her as in the day that she was born , and make her as a wilderness , and set her as a dry land , and slay her with thirst .
DARBY	Hosea	2	4	And I will not have mercy upon her children ; for they are the children of whoredoms .
DARBY	Hosea	2	5	For their mother hath played the harlot ; she that conceived them hath done shamefully : for she said , I will go after my lovers , that give [ me ] my bread and my water , my wool and my flax , mine oil and my drink .
DARBY	Hosea	2	6	Therefore behold , I will hedge up thy way with thorns ; and I will fence [ her ] in with a wall , that she shall not find her paths .
DARBY	Hosea	2	7	And she shall pursue after her lovers , and shall not overtake them ; and she shall seek them , and shall not find them : and she shall say , I will go and return to my first husband , for then was it better with me than now .
DARBY	Hosea	2	8	And she did not know that I had given her the corn and the new wine and the oil , and had multiplied to her the silver and gold , which they employed for Baal .
DARBY	Hosea	2	9	Therefore will I return , and take away my corn in the time thereof , and my new wine in its season , and will withdraw my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness .
DARBY	Hosea	2	10	And now will I discover her impiety in the sight of her lovers , and none shall deliver her out of my hand .
DARBY	Hosea	2	11	And I will cause all her mirth to cease : her feasts , her new moons , and her sabbaths ! and all her solemnities .
DARBY	Hosea	2	12	And I will make desolate her vine and her fig-tree , whereof she hath said , These are my rewards which my lovers have given me ; and I will make them a forest , and the beasts of the field shall eat them .
DARBY	Hosea	2	13	And I will visit upon her the days of the Baals , wherein she burned incense to them , and decked herself with her rings and jewels , and went after her lovers , and forgot me , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Hosea	2	14	Therefore behold , I will allure her , and bring her into the wilderness , and speak to her heart .
DARBY	Hosea	2	15	And I will give her her vineyards from thence , and the valley of Achor for a door of hope ; and she shall sing there , as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Hosea	2	16	And it shall be in that day , saith Jehovah , [ that ] thou shalt call me , My husband , and shalt call me no more , Baali ;
DARBY	Hosea	2	17	for I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth , and they shall no more be remembered by their name .
DARBY	Hosea	2	18	And I will make a covenant for them in that day with the beasts of the field , and with the fowl of the heavens , and the creeping things of the ground ; and I will break bow and sword and battle out of the land ; and I will make them to lie down safely .
DARBY	Hosea	2	19	And I will betroth thee unto me for ever ; and I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness , and in judgment , and in loving-kindness , and in mercies ;
DARBY	Hosea	2	20	and I will betroth thee unto me in faithfulness : and thou shalt know Jehovah .
DARBY	Hosea	2	21	And it shall come to pass in that day , I will hear , saith Jehovah , I will hear the heavens , and they shall hear the earth ;
DARBY	Hosea	2	22	and the earth shall hear the corn , and the new wine , and the oil ; and they shall hear Jizreel .
DARBY	Hosea	2	23	And I will sow her unto me in the land ; and I will have mercy upon Lo-ruhamah ; and I will say to Lo-ammi , Thou art my people ; and they shall say , My God .
DARBY	Hosea	3	3	And I said unto her , Thou shalt abide for me many days ; thou shalt not play the harlot , and thou shalt not be [ another ] man 's , and I will also be for thee .
DARBY	Hosea	3	2	So I bought her to me for fifteen silver [ pieces ] , and for a homer of barley , and a half-homer of barley .
DARBY	Hosea	3	4	For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king , and without prince , and without sacrifice , and without statue , and without ephod and teraphim .
DARBY	Hosea	3	5	Afterwards shall the children of Israel return , and seek Jehovah their God , and David their king ; and shall turn with fear toward Jehovah and toward his goodness , at the end of the days .
DARBY	Hosea	4	4	Yet let no man strive , and let no man reprove ; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest .
DARBY	Hosea	4	2	Swearing , and lying , and killing , and stealing , and committing adultery , —they break out ; and blood toucheth blood .
DARBY	Hosea	4	3	For this shall the land mourn , and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish , with the beasts of the field , and with the fowl of the heavens , yea , the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away .
DARBY	Hosea	4	5	And thou shalt stumble by day ; and the prophet also shall stumble with thee by night : and I will destroy thy mother .
DARBY	Hosea	4	6	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge ; for thou hast rejected knowledge , and I will reject thee , that thou shalt be no priest to me ; seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God , I also will forget thy children .
DARBY	Hosea	4	7	As they were multiplied , so they sinned against me : I will change their glory into shame .
DARBY	Hosea	4	8	They eat the sin of my people , and their soul longeth for their iniquity .
DARBY	Hosea	4	9	And it shall be as the people so the priest ; and I will visit their ways upon them , and recompense to them their doings ;
DARBY	Hosea	4	10	and they shall eat , and not have enough ; they shall commit whoredom , and shall not increase : for they have left off taking heed to Jehovah .
DARBY	Hosea	4	11	Fornication , and wine , and new wine take away the heart .
DARBY	Hosea	4	12	My people ask counsel of their stock , and their staff declareth unto them ; for the spirit of whoredoms causeth [ them ] to err , and they have gone a whoring from under their God :
DARBY	Hosea	4	13	they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains , and burn incense upon the hills , under oak and poplar and terebinth , because the shade thereof is good ; therefore your daughters play the harlot and your daughters-in-law commit adultery .
DARBY	Hosea	4	14	I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot , nor your daughters-in-law for their committing adultery ; for they themselves go aside with harlots , and they sacrifice with prostitutes : and the people that doth not understand shall come to ruin .
DARBY	Hosea	4	15	Though thou , Israel , play the harlot , let not Judah trespass ; and come ye not unto Gilgal , neither go up to Beth-aven , nor swear [ As ] Jehovah liveth !
DARBY	Hosea	4	16	For Israel is refractory as an untractable heifer ; now will Jehovah feed them as a lamb in a wide [ pasture ] .
DARBY	Hosea	4	17	—Ephraim is joined to idols : leave him alone .
DARBY	Hosea	4	18	Their drink is sour ; they give themselves up to whoredom ; her great men passionately love [ their ] shame .
DARBY	Hosea	4	19	The wind hath wrapped her up in its wings , and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices .
DARBY	Hosea	5	5	And Israel 's pride doth testify to his face ; and Israel and Ephraim shall fall by their iniquity : Judah also shall fall with them .
DARBY	Hosea	5	2	And they have plunged themselves in the corruption of apostasy , but I will be a chastiser of them all .
DARBY	Hosea	5	3	I know Ephraim , and Israel is not hid from me ; for now , Ephraim , thou hast committed whoredom ; Israel is defiled .
DARBY	Hosea	5	4	Their doings do not allow them to return unto their God ; for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them , and they know not Jehovah .
DARBY	Hosea	5	6	They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah ; but they shall not find [ him ] : he hath withdrawn himself from them .
DARBY	Hosea	5	7	They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah ; for they have begotten strange children : now shall the new moon devour them , with their allotted possessions .
DARBY	Hosea	5	8	Blow the horn in Gibeah , the trumpet in Ramah ; cry aloud [ at ] Beth-aven : behind thee , O Benjamin !
DARBY	Hosea	5	9	Ephraim shall be a desolation in the day of rebuke : among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which is sure .
DARBY	Hosea	5	10	The princes of Judah are become like them that remove the landmark : I will pour out my wrath upon them like water .
DARBY	Hosea	5	11	Ephraim is oppressed , crushed in judgment , because in selfwill he walked after the commandment [ of man ] .
DARBY	Hosea	5	12	And I will be unto Ephraim as a moth , and to the house of Judah as rottenness .
DARBY	Hosea	5	13	When Ephraim saw his sickness , and Judah his sore , then went Ephraim to the Assyrian , and sent to king Jareb ; but he was unable to heal you , nor hath he removed your sore .
DARBY	Hosea	5	14	For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion , and as a young lion to the house of Judah . I , I will tear and go away ; I will carry off , and there shall be none to deliver .
DARBY	Hosea	5	15	I will go away , I will return to my place , till they acknowledge their trespass , and seek my face : in their affliction they will seek me early .
DARBY	Hosea	6	6	For I delight in loving-kindness , and not sacrifice ; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings .
DARBY	Hosea	6	2	After two days will he revive us ; on the third day he will raise us up , and we shall live before his face ;
DARBY	Hosea	6	3	and we shall know , —we shall follow on to know Jehovah : his going forth is assured as the morning dawn ; and he will come unto us as the rain , as the latter rain which watereth the earth .
DARBY	Hosea	6	4	What shall I do unto thee , Ephraim ? What shall I do unto thee , Judah ? For your goodness is as a morning cloud , and as the dew that early passeth away .
DARBY	Hosea	6	5	Therefore have I hewed [ them ] by the prophets ; I have slain them by the words of my mouth : and my judgment goeth forth as the light .
DARBY	Hosea	6	7	But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant : there have they dealt treacherously against me .
DARBY	Hosea	6	8	Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity ; it is tracked with blood .
DARBY	Hosea	6	9	And as troops of robbers lie in wait for a man , so the company of priests murder in the way of Shechem ; yea , they commit lewdness .
DARBY	Hosea	6	10	In the house of Israel have I seen a horrible thing : the whoredom of Ephraim is there ; Israel is defiled .
DARBY	Hosea	6	11	Also , for thee , Judah , is a harvest appointed , when I shall turn again the captivity of my people .
DARBY	Hosea	7	7	They are all hot as an oven , and devour their judges ; all their kings are fallen : there is none among them that calleth unto me .
DARBY	Hosea	7	2	And they say not in their hearts [ that ] I remember all their wickedness : now do their own doings encompass them ; they are before my face .
DARBY	Hosea	7	3	They make the king glad with their wickedness , and the princes with their lies .
DARBY	Hosea	7	4	They all practise adultery , as an oven heated by the baker : he ceaseth from stirring [ the fire ] after he hath kneaded the dough , until it be leavened .
DARBY	Hosea	7	5	In the day of our king , the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine : he stretched out his hand to scorners .
DARBY	Hosea	7	6	For they have applied their heart like an oven to their lying in wait : their baker sleepeth all the night ; in the morning it burneth like a flaming fire .
DARBY	Hosea	7	8	Ephraim , he mixeth himself with the peoples ; Ephraim is a cake not turned .
DARBY	Hosea	7	9	Strangers have devoured his strength , and he knoweth [ it ] not ; yea , gray hairs are here and there upon him , and he knoweth [ it ] not .
DARBY	Hosea	7	10	And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face ; and they do not return to Jehovah their God , nor seek him for all this .
DARBY	Hosea	7	11	And Ephraim is become like a silly dove without understanding : they call to Egypt , they go to Assyria .
DARBY	Hosea	7	12	When they go , I will spread my net upon them ; I will bring them down as the fowl of the heavens ; I will chastise them , according as their assembly hath heard .
DARBY	Hosea	7	13	Woe unto them ! for they have wandered from me ; destruction unto them ! for they have transgressed against me . And I would redeem them ; but they speak lies against me .
DARBY	Hosea	7	14	And they cried not unto me in their heart , when they howled upon their beds ; they assemble themselves for corn and new wine ; they have turned aside from me .
DARBY	Hosea	7	15	I have indeed trained , I have strengthened their arms , but they imagine mischief against me .
DARBY	Hosea	7	16	They return , [ but ] not to the [ Most ] High : they are like a deceitful bow . Their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue : this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt .
DARBY	Hosea	8	8	Israel is swallowed up : now are they become among the nations as a vessel wherein is no pleasure .
DARBY	Hosea	8	2	They shall cry unto me , My God , we know thee ; [ we ] , Israel .
DARBY	Hosea	8	3	Israel hath cast off good : the enemy shall pursue him .
DARBY	Hosea	8	4	They have set up kings , but not by me ; they have made princes , and I knew it not ; of their silver and their gold have they made them idols , that they may be cut off .
DARBY	Hosea	8	5	Thy calf , O Samaria , hath cast [ thee ] off ; mine anger is kindled against them : how long will they be incapable of purity ?
DARBY	Hosea	8	6	For from Israel is this also : —a workman made it , and it is no God : for the calf of Samaria shall be [ broken in ] pieces .
DARBY	Hosea	8	7	For they have sown the wind , and they shall reap the whirlwind : it hath no stalk ; should it sprout , it would yield no meal ; if so be it yield , strangers shall swallow it up .
DARBY	Hosea	8	9	For they are gone up [ to ] Assyria [ as ] a wild ass alone by himself : Ephraim hath hired lovers .
DARBY	Hosea	8	10	Although they hire among the nations , now will I gather them , and they shall begin to be straitened under the burden of the king of princes .
DARBY	Hosea	8	11	Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin , altars shall be unto him to sin .
DARBY	Hosea	8	12	I have prescribed unto him the manifold things of my law : they are counted [ as ] a strange thing .
DARBY	Hosea	8	13	They sacrifice flesh [ for ] the sacrifices of mine offerings , and eat it ; Jehovah hath no delight in them . Now will he remember their iniquity , and visit their sins : they shall return to Egypt .
DARBY	Hosea	8	14	For Israel hath forgotten his Maker , and buildeth temples ; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities : but I will send a fire upon his cities , and it shall devour the palaces thereof .
DARBY	Hosea	9	9	They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah . He will remember their iniquity , he will visit their sins .
DARBY	Hosea	9	2	The floor and the winepress shall not feed them , and the new wine shall fail her .
DARBY	Hosea	9	3	They shall not dwell in Jehovah 's land ; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt , and in Assyria shall they eat that which is unclean .
DARBY	Hosea	9	4	They shall pour out no [ offerings of ] wine to Jehovah , neither shall their sacrifices be pleasing unto him : they shall be unto them as the bread of mourners ; all that eat thereof shall be defiled : for their bread shall be for themselves ; it shall not come into the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	Hosea	9	5	What will ye do in the day of assembly , and in the day of the feast of Jehovah ?
DARBY	Hosea	9	6	For behold , they are gone away because of destruction : Egypt shall gather them up , Moph shall bury them : their pleasant things of silver , nettles shall possess them ; thorns shall be in their tents .
DARBY	Hosea	9	7	The days of visitation are come ; the days of recompence are come : Israel shall know [ it ] : the prophet is a fool , the inspired man is mad , because of the greatness of thine iniquity , and the great enmity .
DARBY	Hosea	9	8	Is Ephraim a watchman with my God ? [ nay ] the prophet is a fowler 's snare on all his ways , enmity in the house of his God .
DARBY	Hosea	9	10	I found Israel as grapes in the wilderness ; as first-ripe fruit on the fig-tree , I saw your fathers at the beginning : they went to Baal-Peor , and separated themselves unto that shame , and became abominations like their lover .
DARBY	Hosea	9	11	As for Ephraim , their glory shall fly away as a bird , —no birth , no pregnancy , no conception !
DARBY	Hosea	9	12	For even should they bring up their children , yet will I bereave them , [ that ] not a man [ remain ] : for woe also to them when I shall have departed from them !
DARBY	Hosea	9	13	Ephraim , as I saw [ him ] , was a Tyre planted in a beautiful place ; but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the slayer .
DARBY	Hosea	9	14	Give them , Jehovah—what wilt thou give ? —give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts .
DARBY	Hosea	9	15	All their wickedness is in Gilgal ; for there I hated them : because of the wickedness of their doings , I will drive them out of my house , I will love them no more : all their princes are rebellious .
DARBY	Hosea	9	16	Ephraim is smitten : their root is dried up , they shall bear no fruit ; yea , though they should bring forth , yet will I slay the beloved [ fruit ] of their womb .
DARBY	Hosea	9	17	My God hath rejected them , because they hearkened not unto him ; and they shall be wanderers among the nations .
DARBY	Hosea	10	10	At my pleasure will I chastise them ; and the peoples shall be assembled against them , when they are bound for their two iniquities .
DARBY	Hosea	10	2	Their heart is divided ; now shall they be found guilty : he will break down their altars , he will destroy their statues .
DARBY	Hosea	10	3	For now they will say , We have no king , for we feared not Jehovah ; and a king , what can he do for us ?
DARBY	Hosea	10	4	They speak [ mere ] words , swearing falsely in making a covenant ; therefore shall judgment spring up as hemlock in the furrows of the fields .
DARBY	Hosea	10	5	The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calf of Beth-aven ; for the people thereof shall mourn over it , and the idolatrous priests thereof shall tremble for it , for its glory , because it is departed from it .
DARBY	Hosea	10	6	Yea , it shall be carried unto Assyria [ as ] a present for king Jareb : Ephraim shall be seized with shame , and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel .
DARBY	Hosea	10	7	As for Samaria her king is cut off as chips upon the face of the waters .
DARBY	Hosea	10	8	And the high places of Aven , the sin of Israel , shall be destroyed : the thorn and the thistle shall come up upon their altars ; and they shall say to the mountains , Cover us ! and to the hills , Fall on us !
DARBY	Hosea	10	9	From the days of Gibeah hast thou sinned , O Israel : there they stood : the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them .
DARBY	Hosea	10	11	And Ephraim is a trained heifer , that loveth to tread out [ the corn ] ; I have passed over upon her fair neck : I will make Ephraim to draw ; Judah shall plough , Jacob shall break his clods .
DARBY	Hosea	10	12	Sow to yourselves in righteousness , reap according to mercy ; break up your fallow ground : for it is time to seek Jehovah , till he come and rain righteousness upon you .
DARBY	Hosea	10	13	Ye have ploughed wickedness , reaped iniquity , eaten the fruit of lies ; for thou didst confide in thy way , in the multitude of thy mighty men .
DARBY	Hosea	10	14	And a tumult shall arise among thy peoples , and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled , as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle : the mother was dashed in pieces with the children .
DARBY	Hosea	10	15	So shall Bethel do unto you because of the wickedness of your wickedness : at day-break shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off .
DARBY	Hosea	11	11	they shall hasten as a bird out of Egypt , and as a dove out of the land of Assyria ; and I will cause them to dwell in their houses , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Hosea	11	2	As they called them , so they went from them : they sacrificed unto the Baals , and burned incense to graven images .
DARBY	Hosea	11	3	And I it was that taught Ephraim to walk , —He took them upon his arms , —but they knew not that I healed them .
DARBY	Hosea	11	4	I drew them with bands of a man , with cords of love ; and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws , and I gently caused them to eat .
DARBY	Hosea	11	5	He shall not return into the land of Egypt , but the Assyrian shall be his king ; for they refused to return [ to me ] ;
DARBY	Hosea	11	6	and the sword shall turn about in his cities , and shall consume his bars , and devour [ them ] , because of their own counsels .
DARBY	Hosea	11	7	Yea , my people are bent upon backsliding from me : though they call them to the Most High , none at all exalteth [ him ] .
DARBY	Hosea	11	8	How shall I give thee over , Ephraim ? [ how ] shall I deliver thee up , Israel ? how shall I make thee as Admah ? [ how ] shall I set thee as Zeboim ? My heart is turned within me , my repentings are kindled together .
DARBY	Hosea	11	9	I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger , I will not again destroy Ephraim ; for I am God , and not man , —the Holy One in the midst of thee : and I will not come in anger .
DARBY	Hosea	11	10	They shall walk after Jehovah ; he shall roar like a lion ; when he shall roar , then the children shall hasten from the west :
DARBY	Hosea	11	12	Ephraim encompasseth me about with lies , and the house of Israel with deceit ; but Judah yet walketh with God , and with the holy things of truth .
DARBY	Hosea	12	12	And Jacob fled into the country of Syria , and Israel served for a wife , and for a wife he kept [ sheep ] .
DARBY	Hosea	12	2	Jehovah hath also a controversy with Judah , and he will punish Jacob according to his ways ; according to his doings will he recompense him .
DARBY	Hosea	12	3	He took his brother by the heel in the womb , and in his strength he wrestled with God .
DARBY	Hosea	12	4	Yea , he wrestled with the Angel , and prevailed ; he wept , and made supplication unto him : he found him in Bethel , and there he spoke with us ,
DARBY	Hosea	12	5	—even Jehovah , the God of hosts , —Jehovah is his memorial .
DARBY	Hosea	12	6	And thou , return unto thy God : keep loving-kindness and judgment , and wait on thy God continually .
DARBY	Hosea	12	7	[ He is ] a merchant , balances of deceit are in his hand ; he loveth to oppress .
DARBY	Hosea	12	8	And Ephraim saith , Nevertheless I am become rich , I have found me out substance ; in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin .
DARBY	Hosea	12	9	But I [ that am ] Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt will again make thee to dwell in tents , as in the days of the solemn feast .
DARBY	Hosea	12	10	And I have spoken to the prophets , and I have multiplied visions , and by means of the prophets have I used similitudes .
DARBY	Hosea	12	11	If Gilead is iniquity , surely they are but vanity : they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal ; yea , their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields .
DARBY	Hosea	12	13	And by a prophet Jehovah brought Israel out of Egypt , and by a prophet was he preserved .
DARBY	Hosea	12	14	Ephraim provoked [ him ] to anger most bitterly ; and his Lord shall leave his blood upon him , and recompense unto him his reproach .
DARBY	Hosea	13	13	The pangs of a woman in travail shall come upon him : he is a son not wise ; for at the time of the breaking forth of children , he was not there .
DARBY	Hosea	13	2	And now they sin more and more , and have made them molten images of their silver , idols according to their own understanding , all of it the work of the craftsmen : they say of them , Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves .
DARBY	Hosea	13	3	Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud , and as the early dew that passeth away , as the chaff driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing-floor , and as the smoke out of the lattice .
DARBY	Hosea	13	4	Yet I [ am ] Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt , and thou hast known no God but me ; and there is no saviour besides me .
DARBY	Hosea	13	5	I knew thee in the wilderness , in the land of drought .
DARBY	Hosea	13	6	According to their pasture , they became full ; they became full , and their heart was exalted : therefore have they forgotten me .
DARBY	Hosea	13	7	And I will be unto them as a lion ; as a leopard I will lurk for them by the way ;
DARBY	Hosea	13	8	I will meet them as a bear bereaved of her [ whelps ] , and will rend the covering of their heart , and there will I devour them like a lioness : the beast of the field shall tear them .
DARBY	Hosea	13	9	It is thy destruction , O Israel , that [ thou art ] against me , against thy help .
DARBY	Hosea	13	10	Where then is thy king , that he may save thee in all thy cities ? and thy judges of whom thou saidst , Give me a king and princes ? —
DARBY	Hosea	13	11	I gave thee a king in mine anger , and took him away in my wrath .
DARBY	Hosea	13	12	The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up ; his sin is laid by in store .
DARBY	Hosea	13	14	I will ransom them from the power of Sheol . I will redeem them from death : where , O death , are thy plagues ? where , O Sheol , is thy destruction ? Repentance shall be hid from mine eyes .
DARBY	Hosea	13	15	Though he be fruitful among [ his ] brethren , an east wind shall come , a wind of Jehovah [ that ] cometh up from the wilderness , and his spring shall become dry , and his fountain shall be dried up : he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels .
DARBY	Hosea	13	16	Samaria shall bear her guilt ; for she hath rebelled against her God : they shall fall by the sword ; their infants shall be dashed in pieces , and their women with child shall be ripped up .
DARBY	Hosea	14	14	O Israel , return unto Jehovah thy God ; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity .
DARBY	Hosea	14	2	Take with you words , and turn to Jehovah ; say unto him , Forgive all iniquity , and receive [ us ] graciously ; so will we render the calves of our lips .
DARBY	Hosea	14	3	Assyria shall not save us ; we will not ride upon horses : neither will we say any more to the work of our hands , [ Thou art ] our God ; because in thee the fatherless findeth mercy .
DARBY	Hosea	14	4	I will heal their backsliding , I will love them freely ; for mine anger is turned away from him .
DARBY	Hosea	14	5	I will be as the dew unto Israel : he shall blossom as the lily , and cast forth his roots as Lebanon .
DARBY	Hosea	14	6	His shoots shall spread , and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree , and his smell as Lebanon .
DARBY	Hosea	14	7	They shall return and sit under his shadow ; they shall revive [ as ] corn , and blossom as the vine : the renown thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon .
DARBY	Hosea	14	8	Ephraim [ shall say ] , What have I to do any more with idols ? ( I answer [ him ] , and I will observe him . ) I am like a green fir-tree.—From me is thy fruit found .
DARBY	Hosea	14	9	Who is wise , and he shall understand these things ? intelligent , and he shall know them ? For the ways of Jehovah are right , and the just shall walk in them ; but the transgressors shall fall therein .
DARBY	Joel	1	1	The word of Jehovah that came to Joel the son of Pethuel .
DARBY	Joel	1	2	Hear this , ye old men , and give ear , all ye inhabitants of the land . Hath this been in your days , or even in the days of your fathers ?
DARBY	Joel	1	3	Tell your children of it , and [ let ] your children [ tell ] their children , and their children another generation :
DARBY	Joel	1	4	that which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten ; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten ; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten .
DARBY	Joel	1	5	Awake , ye drunkards , and weep ; and howl , all ye drinkers of wine , because of the new wine : for it is cut off from your mouth .
DARBY	Joel	1	6	For a nation is come up upon my land , strong and without number : his teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he hath the cheek teeth of a lioness .
DARBY	Joel	1	7	He hath made my vine a desolation , and barked my fig-tree ; he hath made it clean bare , and cast it away : its branches are made white .
DARBY	Joel	1	8	Wail like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth .
DARBY	Joel	1	9	The oblation and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of Jehovah ; the priests , Jehovah 's ministers , mourn .
DARBY	Joel	1	10	The field is laid waste , the land mourneth ; for the corn is wasted , the new wine is dried up , the oil languisheth .
DARBY	Joel	1	11	Be ashamed , ye husbandmen ; howl , ye vinedressers , for the wheat and for the barley : because the harvest of the field hath perished .
DARBY	Joel	1	12	The vine is dried up , and the fig-tree languisheth ; the pomegranate-tree , the palm also and the apple-tree ; all the trees of the field are withered , yea , joy is withered away from the children of men .
DARBY	Joel	1	13	Gird yourselves , and lament , ye priests ; howl , ministers of the altar ; come , lie all night in sackcloth , ye ministers of my God : for the oblation and the drink-offering are withholden from the house of your God .
DARBY	Joel	1	14	Hallow a fast , proclaim a solemn assembly , gather the elders , [ and ] all the inhabitants of the land to the house of Jehovah your God , and cry unto Jehovah .
DARBY	Joel	1	15	Alas for the day ! for the day of Jehovah is at hand , and as destruction from the Almighty shall it come .
DARBY	Joel	1	16	Is not the food cut off before our eyes , joy and gladness from the house of our God ?
DARBY	Joel	1	17	The seeds are rotten under their clods , the granaries are laid desolate , the barns are broken down ; for the corn is withered .
DARBY	Joel	1	18	How do the beasts groan ! The herds of cattle are bewildered , for they have no pasture ; the flocks of sheep also are in suffering .
DARBY	Joel	1	19	To thee , Jehovah , do I cry ; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame hath burned up all the trees of the field .
DARBY	Joel	1	20	The beasts of the field also cry unto thee ; for the water-courses are dried , and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness .
DARBY	Joel	2	2	a day of darkness and gloom , a day of clouds and gross darkness , as the dawn spread upon the mountains ; —a great people and a strong ; there hath not been ever the like , neither shall be any more after them , to the years of generations and generations .
DARBY	Joel	2	3	A fire devoureth before them , and behind them a flame burneth ; the land is as a garden of Eden before them , and behind them a desolate wilderness : yea , and nothing escapeth them .
DARBY	Joel	2	4	The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses ; and as horsemen , so they run .
DARBY	Joel	2	5	Like the noise of chariots , on the tops of the mountains , they leap ; like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble , as a strong people set in battle array .
DARBY	Joel	2	6	Before them the peoples are in anguish : all faces turn pale .
DARBY	Joel	2	7	They run like mighty men ; they climb the wall like men of war ; and they march every one on his ways , and break not their ranks .
DARBY	Joel	2	8	Neither doth one press upon another ; they march every one in his path ; and fall amid weapons , but are not wounded .
DARBY	Joel	2	9	They spread themselves over the city ; they run upon the wall ; they climb up into the houses ; they enter in by the windows like a thief .
DARBY	Joel	2	10	The earth quaketh before them ; the heavens tremble ; the sun and the moon are darkened , and the stars withdraw their shining .
DARBY	Joel	2	11	And Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army ; for his camp is very great ; for strong is he that executeth his word : for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible ; and who can bear it ?
DARBY	Joel	2	12	Yet even now , saith Jehovah , turn to me with all your heart , and with fasting , and with weeping , and with mourning ;
DARBY	Joel	2	13	and rend your heart , and not your garments , and turn unto Jehovah your God : for he is gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and of great loving-kindness , and repenteth him of the evil .
DARBY	Joel	2	14	Who knoweth ? He might return and repent , and leave a blessing behind him , an oblation and a drink-offering for Jehovah your God ?
DARBY	Joel	2	15	Blow the trumpet in Zion , hallow a fast , proclaim a solemn assembly ;
DARBY	Joel	2	16	gather the people , hallow the congregation , assemble the elders , gather the children , and those that suck the breasts ; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber , and the bride from her closet .
DARBY	Joel	2	17	Let the priests , the ministers of Jehovah , weep between the porch and the altar , and let them say , Spare , O Jehovah , thy people , and give not thine inheritance to reproach , that they should be a byword of the nations . Wherefore should they say among the peoples , Where is their God ?
DARBY	Joel	2	18	Then Jehovah will be jealous for his land , and will have pity on his people .
DARBY	Joel	2	19	And Jehovah will answer and say unto his people , Behold , I send you corn , and new wine , and oil , and ye shall be satisfied therewith ; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations .
DARBY	Joel	2	20	And I will remove far off from you him [ that cometh ] from the north , and will drive him into a land barren and desolate , his face toward the eastern sea , and his rear toward the hinder sea ; and his stench shall come up , and his ill odour shall come up , for he hath exalted himself to do great things .
DARBY	Joel	2	21	—Fear not , O land ; be glad and rejoice : for Jehovah doeth great things .
DARBY	Joel	2	22	Be not afraid , ye beasts of the field : for the pastures of the wilderness do spring ; for the tree beareth its fruit ; the fig-tree and the vine yield full increase .
DARBY	Joel	2	23	And ye , children of Zion , be glad and rejoice in Jehovah your God ; for he giveth you the early rain in due measure , and he causeth to come down for you the rain , the early rain , and the latter rain at the beginning [ of the season ] .
DARBY	Joel	2	24	And the floors shall be full of corn , and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil .
DARBY	Joel	2	25	And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten , the cankerworm , and the caterpillar , and the palmer-worm , my great army which I sent among you .
DARBY	Joel	2	26	And ye shall eat in plenty , and be satisfied , and praise the name of Jehovah your God , who hath dealt wondrously with you : and my people shall never be ashamed .
DARBY	Joel	2	27	And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I , Jehovah , [ am ] your God , and there is none else : and my people shall never be ashamed .
DARBY	Joel	2	28	And it shall come to pass afterwards [ that ] I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your old men shall dream dreams , your young men shall see visions .
DARBY	Joel	2	29	Yea , even upon the bondmen and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit .
DARBY	Joel	2	30	And I will shew wonders in the heavens and on the earth , blood , and fire , and pillars of smoke .
DARBY	Joel	2	31	The sun shall be changed to darkness , and the moon to blood , before the great and terrible day of Jehovah come .
DARBY	Joel	2	32	And it shall be that whosoever shall call upon the name of Jehovah shall be saved : for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance , as Jehovah hath said , and for the residue whom Jehovah shall call .
DARBY	Joel	3	3	and they have cast lots for my people , and have given a boy for a harlot , and sold a girl for wine , and have drunk [ it ] .
DARBY	Joel	3	2	I will also gather all the nations , and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat , and I will enter into judgment with them there on account of my people and mine inheritance , Israel , whom they have scattered among the nations : and they have parted my land ;
DARBY	Joel	3	4	Yea also , what have ye to do with me , O Tyre and Zidon , and all the districts of Philistia ? Will ye render me a recompence ? But if ye recompense me , swiftly [ and ] speedily will I bring your recompence upon your own head ;
DARBY	Joel	3	5	because ye have taken my silver and my gold , and have carried into your temples my beautiful pleasant things ,
DARBY	Joel	3	6	and the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the children of the Greeks , that ye might remove them far from their border .
DARBY	Joel	3	7	Behold , I will raise them up out of the place whither ye have sold them , and will bring your recompence upon your own head .
DARBY	Joel	3	8	And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah , and they shall sell them to the Sabeans , to a nation far off : for Jehovah hath spoken .
DARBY	Joel	3	9	Proclaim this among the nations : prepare war , arouse the mighty men , let all the men of war draw near , let them come up .
DARBY	Joel	3	10	Beat your ploughshares into swords , and your pruning-knives into spears ; let the weak say , I am strong .
DARBY	Joel	3	11	Haste ye and come , all ye nations round about , and gather yourselves together . Thither cause thy mighty ones to come down , O Jehovah .
DARBY	Joel	3	12	Let the nations rouse themselves , and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat ; for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about .
DARBY	Joel	3	13	Put in the sickle , for the harvest is ripe : come , get you down , for the press is full , the vats overflow ; for their wickedness is great .
DARBY	Joel	3	14	Multitudes , multitudes in the valley of decision ! For the day of Jehovah is at hand in the valley of decision .
DARBY	Joel	3	15	The sun and the moon shall be darkened , and the stars shall withdraw their shining .
DARBY	Joel	3	16	And Jehovah will roar from Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the heavens and the earth shall shake : and Jehovah will be a shelter for his people , and the refuge of the children of Israel .
DARBY	Joel	3	17	And ye shall know that I , Jehovah , [ am ] your God , dwelling in Zion , my holy mountain ; and Jerusalem shall be holy , and no strangers shall pass through her any more .
DARBY	Joel	3	18	And it shall come to pass in that day , that the mountains shall drop down new wine , and the hills shall flow with milk , and all the water-courses of Judah shall flow with waters ; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah , and shall water the valley of Shittim .
DARBY	Joel	3	19	Egypt shall be a desolation , and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness , for the violence against the children of Judah , in that they have shed innocent blood in their land .
DARBY	Joel	3	20	But Judah shall abide for ever , and Jerusalem from generation to generation .
DARBY	Joel	3	21	And I will purge them from the blood from which I had not purged them : for Jehovah dwelleth in Zion .
DARBY	Amos	1	1	The words of Amos , who was among the herdmen of Tekoa , which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah , and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash , king of Israel , two years before the earthquake .
DARBY	Amos	1	2	And he said , Jehovah roareth from Zion , and uttereth his voice from Jerusalem ; and the pastures of the shepherds mourn , and the top of Carmel withereth .
DARBY	Amos	1	3	Thus saith Jehovah : For three transgressions of Damascus , and for four , I will not revoke [ my sentence ] , because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron .
DARBY	Amos	1	4	And I will send a fire into the house of Hazael , and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-Hadad .
DARBY	Amos	1	5	And I will break the bar of Damascus , and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven , and him that holdeth the sceptre from Beth-Eden ; and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	1	6	Thus saith Jehovah : For three transgressions of Gazah , and for four , I will not revoke its sentence ; because they carried away captive the whole captivity , to deliver [ them ] up to Edom .
DARBY	Amos	1	7	And I will send a fire on the wall of Gazah , and it shall devour the palaces thereof .
DARBY	Amos	1	8	And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod , and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon , and I will turn my hand against Ekron ; and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	1	9	Thus saith Jehovah : For three transgressions of Tyre , and for four , I will not revoke its sentence ; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom , and remembered not the brotherly covenant .
DARBY	Amos	1	10	And I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre , and it shall devour the palaces thereof .
DARBY	Amos	1	11	Thus saith Jehovah : For three transgressions of Edom , and for four , I will not revoke its sentence ; because he pursued his brother with the sword , and cast off all pity ; and his anger did tear continually , and he kept his wrath for ever .
DARBY	Amos	1	12	And I will send a fire upon Teman , and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah .
DARBY	Amos	1	13	Thus saith Jehovah : For three transgressions of the children of Ammon , and for four , I will not revoke its sentence ; because they ripped up the women with child of Gilead , that they might enlarge their border .
DARBY	Amos	1	14	And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah , and it shall devour the palaces thereof , with shouting in the day of battle , with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind .
DARBY	Amos	1	15	And their king shall go into captivity , he and his princes together , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	2	2	And I will send a fire upon Moab , and it shall devour the palaces of Kerijoth ; and Moab shall die with tumult , with shouting , [ and ] with the sound of the trumpet .
DARBY	Amos	2	3	And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof , and will slay all the princes thereof with him , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	2	4	Thus saith Jehovah : For three transgressions of Judah , and for four , I will not revoke its sentence ; because they have despised the law of Jehovah , and have not kept his statutes ; and their lies have caused them to err , after which their fathers walked .
DARBY	Amos	2	5	And I will send a fire upon Judah , and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Amos	2	6	Thus saith Jehovah : For three transgressions of Israel , and for four , I will not revoke its sentence ; because they have sold the righteous for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes ;
DARBY	Amos	2	7	panting after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , and turning aside the way of the meek ; and a man and his father will go in unto the [ same ] maid , to profane my holy name .
DARBY	Amos	2	8	And they lay [ themselves ] down by every altar upon clothes taken in pledge , and they drink [ in ] the house of their God the wine of the condemned .
DARBY	Amos	2	9	But I destroyed the Amorite before them , whose height was as the height of the cedars , and he was strong as the oaks ; but I destroyed his fruit from above , and his roots from beneath .
DARBY	Amos	2	10	And I brought you up from the land of Egypt , and led you forty years in the wilderness , to possess the land of the Amorite .
DARBY	Amos	2	11	And I raised up of your sons for prophets , and of your young men for Nazarites . Is it not even thus , ye children of Israel ? saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	2	12	And ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink ; and commanded the prophets , saying , Prophesy not .
DARBY	Amos	2	13	Behold , I will press upon you , as a cart presseth that is full of sheaves .
DARBY	Amos	2	14	And flight shall perish from the swift , and the strong shall not strengthen his force , neither shall the mighty deliver his soul .
DARBY	Amos	2	15	Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow ; and the swift of foot shall not escape , and he that rideth the horse shall not deliver his soul ;
DARBY	Amos	2	16	and he that is stout-hearted among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	3	3	Shall two walk together except they be agreed ?
DARBY	Amos	3	2	You only have I known of all the families of the earth ; therefore will I visit upon you all your iniquities .
DARBY	Amos	3	4	Will a lion roar in the forest when he hath no prey ? Will a young lion cry out of his den if he have taken nothing ?
DARBY	Amos	3	5	Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth when no gin [ is laid ] for him ? Will the snare spring up from the earth when nothing at all hath been taken ?
DARBY	Amos	3	6	Shall a trumpet be blown in the city , and the people not be afraid ? Shall there be evil in a city , and Jehovah not have done [ it ] ?
DARBY	Amos	3	7	But the Lord Jehovah will do nothing , but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets .
DARBY	Amos	3	8	The lion hath roared , —who will not fear ? The Lord Jehovah hath spoken , —who can but prophesy ?
DARBY	Amos	3	9	Publish in the palaces at Ashdod , and in the palaces in the land of Egypt , and say , Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria , and behold the great uproar in the midst thereof , and the oppressions that are within her :
DARBY	Amos	3	10	and they know not to do right , saith Jehovah , who store up violence and plunder in their palaces .
DARBY	Amos	3	11	Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah : An adversary ! —even round about the land ! And he shall bring down thy strength from thee , and thy palaces shall be pillaged .
DARBY	Amos	3	12	Thus saith Jehovah : Like as the shepherd rescueth out of the jaw of the lion two legs , or a piece of an ear ; so shall the children of Israel be rescued that sit in Samaria in the corner of a couch , and upon the damask of a bed .
DARBY	Amos	3	13	Hear ye , and testify in the house of Jacob , saith the Lord Jehovah , the God of hosts ,
DARBY	Amos	3	14	that in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him , I will also punish the altars of Bethel ; and the horns of the altar shall be cut off , and fall to the ground .
DARBY	Amos	3	15	And I will smite the winter-house with the summer-house ; and the houses of ivory shall perish , and many houses shall have an end , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	4	4	Come to Bethel , and transgress ; at Gilgal multiply transgression ; and bring your sacrifices in the morning , your tithes every three days ,
DARBY	Amos	4	2	the Lord Jehovah hath sworn by his holiness , that behold , days shall come upon you , when he will take you away with hooks , and your posterity with fish-hooks ;
DARBY	Amos	4	3	and ye shall go out by the breaches , every one straight before her , and ye shall be cast out to Harmon , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	4	5	and burn a thank-offering with leaven , and proclaim , publish , voluntary offerings : for this pleaseth you , children of Israel , saith the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	4	6	And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities , and want of bread in all your places ; yet ye have not returned unto me , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	4	7	And I also have withholden the rain from you , when there were yet three months to the harvest ; and I caused it to rain upon one city , and caused it not to rain upon another city : one piece [ of land ] was rained upon , and the piece whereupon it rained not withered .
DARBY	Amos	4	8	And two , three , cities wandered unto one city , to drink water , and were not satisfied : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	4	9	I have smitten you with blasting and mildew ; the palmer-worm hath devoured the multitude of your gardens , and your vineyards , and your fig-trees and your olive-trees : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	4	10	I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt : your young men have I slain with the sword , taking away captive your horses ; and I made the stench of your camps to come up , even into your nostrils : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	4	11	I have overthrown among you , like God 's overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah , and ye were as a brand plucked out of the burning ; yet have ye not returned unto me , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	4	12	Therefore thus will I do unto thee , O Israel : because I will do this unto thee , prepare to meet thy God , O Israel .
DARBY	Amos	4	13	For behold , he who formeth the mountains , and createth the wind , and declareth unto man what is his thought , who maketh the morning darkness , and treadeth upon the high places of the earth , —Jehovah , the God of hosts , is his name .
DARBY	Amos	5	5	And seek not Bethel , neither go to Gilgal , and pass not to Beer-sheba ; for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity , and Bethel shall come to nought .
DARBY	Amos	5	2	The virgin of Israel is fallen ; she shall no more arise : she is cast down upon her land ; there is none to raise her up .
DARBY	Amos	5	3	For thus saith the Lord Jehovah : The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left , and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left , for the house of Israel .
DARBY	Amos	5	4	For thus saith Jehovah unto the house of Israel : Seek ye me , and ye shall live .
DARBY	Amos	5	6	Seek Jehovah , and ye shall live ; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and devour [ it ] , and there be none to quench [ it ] in Bethel .
DARBY	Amos	5	7	Ye who turn judgment to wormwood , and cast down righteousness to the earth ,
DARBY	Amos	5	8	[ seek him ] that made the Pleiades and Orion , and turneth the shadow of death into the morning , and maketh the day dark with night ; that calleth for the waters of the sea , and poureth them out upon the face of the earth : Jehovah is his name .
DARBY	Amos	5	9	He causeth destruction to break forth suddenly upon the strong , and bringeth destruction upon the fortress .
DARBY	Amos	5	10	They hate him that reproveth in the gate , and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly .
DARBY	Amos	5	11	Forasmuch , therefore , as ye trample upon the poor , and take from him presents of wheat : ye have built houses of hewn stone , but ye shall not dwell in them ; ye have planted pleasant vineyards , and ye shall not drink the wine of them .
DARBY	Amos	5	12	For I know how manifold are your transgressions and your sins mighty : they afflict the just , they take a bribe , and they turn aside [ the right of ] the needy in the gate .
DARBY	Amos	5	13	Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in this time ; for it is an evil time .
DARBY	Amos	5	14	Seek good , and not evil , that ye may live ; and so Jehovah , the God of hosts , shall be with you , as ye say .
DARBY	Amos	5	15	Hate evil , and love good , and establish judgment in the gate : it may be that Jehovah , the God of hosts , will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph .
DARBY	Amos	5	16	Therefore thus saith Jehovah , the God of hosts , the Lord : Wailing shall be in all broadways ; and they shall say in all the streets , Alas ! alas ! And they shall call the husbandman to mourning , and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing .
DARBY	Amos	5	17	And in all vineyards shall be wailing ; for I will pass through the midst of thee , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	5	18	Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah ! To what end is the day of Jehovah for you ? It shall be darkness and not light :
DARBY	Amos	5	19	as if a man fled from a lion , and a bear met him ; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall , and a serpent bit him .
DARBY	Amos	5	20	Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness , and not light ? even very dark , and no brightness in it ?
DARBY	Amos	5	21	I hate , I despise your feasts , and I will not smell [ a sweet odour ] in your solemn assemblies .
DARBY	Amos	5	22	For if ye offer up unto me burnt-offerings and your oblations , I will not accept [ them ] ; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fatted beasts .
DARBY	Amos	5	23	Take away from me the noise of thy songs , and I will not hear the melody of thy lutes ;
DARBY	Amos	5	24	but let judgment roll down as waters , and righteousness as an ever-flowing stream .
DARBY	Amos	5	25	Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and oblations in the wilderness forty years , O house of Israel ?
DARBY	Amos	5	26	Yea , ye took up the tabernacle of your Moloch , and Chiun your images , the star of your god , which ye had made to yourselves ;
DARBY	Amos	5	27	and I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus , saith Jehovah , whose name is the God of hosts .
DARBY	Amos	6	6	that drink wine in bowls , and anoint themselves with the chief ointments ; but are not grieved for the breach of Joseph .
DARBY	Amos	6	2	Pass unto Calneh , and see ; and from thence go to Hamath the great ; and go down to Gath of the Philistines : are they better than these kingdoms ? or their border greater than your border ?
DARBY	Amos	6	3	Ye that put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ;
DARBY	Amos	6	4	that lie upon beds of ivory , and stretch themselves upon their couches , and eat the lambs out of the flock , and the calves from the midst of the stall ;
DARBY	Amos	6	5	that chant to the sound of the lute , [ and ] invent them instruments of music , like David ;
DARBY	Amos	6	7	Therefore shall they now go captive , with the first that go captive , and the revelry of them that stretched themselves shall pass away .
DARBY	Amos	6	8	The Lord Jehovah hath sworn by himself , saith Jehovah , the God of hosts , I abhor the pride of Jacob , and hate his palaces ; and I will deliver up the city with all that is therein .
DARBY	Amos	6	9	And it shall come to pass , if there remain ten men in one house , that they shall die .
DARBY	Amos	6	10	And a man 's uncle , and he that should burn him , shall take him up to bring out the bones from the house , and shall say unto him that is in the inner parts of the house , Is there yet [ any ] with thee ? and he shall say , None . And he will say , Silence ! for we may not make mention of Jehovah 's name .
DARBY	Amos	6	11	For behold , Jehovah commandeth , and he will smite the great house with breaches , and the little house with clefts .
DARBY	Amos	6	12	Shall horses run upon the rock ? will [ men ] plough [ thereon ] with oxen ? For ye have turned judgment into gall , and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood ,
DARBY	Amos	6	13	—ye that rejoice in a thing of nought , that say , Have we not taken to us power by our own strength ?
DARBY	Amos	6	14	For behold , O house of Israel , saith Jehovah the God of hosts , I will raise up against you a nation ; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hamath unto the torrent of the Arabah .
DARBY	Amos	7	7	Thus did he shew unto me ; and behold , the Lord stood upon a wall [ made ] by a plumb-line , with a plumb-line in his hand .
DARBY	Amos	7	2	And it came to pass , when they had wholly eaten the grass of the land , that I said , O Lord Jehovah , forgive , I beseech thee ! How shall Jacob arise ? for he is small .
DARBY	Amos	7	3	Jehovah repented for this : It shall not be , said Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	7	4	Thus did the Lord Jehovah shew unto me ; and behold , the Lord Jehovah called to contend by fire ; and it devoured the great deep , and ate up the inheritance .
DARBY	Amos	7	5	Then said I , O Lord Jehovah , cease , I beseech thee ! How shall Jacob arise ? for he is small .
DARBY	Amos	7	6	Jehovah repented for this : This also shall not be , said the Lord Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	7	8	And Jehovah said unto me , Amos , what seest thou ? And I said , A plumb-line . And the Lord said , Behold , I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel : I will not again pass by them any more .
DARBY	Amos	7	9	And the high places of Isaac shall be desolated , and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste ; and I will arise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword .
DARBY	Amos	7	10	Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel , saying , Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel : the land is not able to bear all his words .
DARBY	Amos	7	11	For thus Amos saith : Jeroboam shall die by the sword , and Israel shall certainly go into captivity out of his land .
DARBY	Amos	7	12	And Amaziah said unto Amos , [ Thou ] seer , go , flee away into the land of Judah , and eat bread there , and prophesy there .
DARBY	Amos	7	13	But prophesy not again any more at Bethel ; for it is the king 's sanctuary , and it is the house of the kingdom .
DARBY	Amos	7	14	And Amos answered and said to Amaziah , I was no prophet , neither was I a prophet 's son ; but I was a herdman , and a gatherer of sycamore fruit .
DARBY	Amos	7	15	And Jehovah took me as I followed the flock , and Jehovah said unto me , Go , prophesy unto my people Israel .
DARBY	Amos	7	16	And now hear thou the word of Jehovah : Thou sayest , Prophesy not against Israel , and utter not [ words ] against the house of Isaac .
DARBY	Amos	7	17	Therefore thus saith Jehovah : Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city , and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword , and thy land shall be divided with the line ; and thou shalt die in a land that is unclean ; and Israel shall certainly go into captivity , out of his land .
DARBY	Amos	8	8	Shall not the land tremble for this , and every one mourn that dwelleth therein ? And it shall wholly rise up like the Nile ; and it shall surge and sink down , as the river of Egypt .
DARBY	Amos	8	2	And he said , Amos , what seest thou ? And I said , A basket of summer-fruit . And Jehovah said unto me , The end is come upon my people Israel : I will not again pass by them any more .
DARBY	Amos	8	3	And the songs of the palace shall be howlings in that day , saith the Lord Jehovah . The dead bodies shall be many ; in every place they shall be cast forth . Silence !
DARBY	Amos	8	4	Hear this , ye that pant after the needy , even to cause to fail the poor of the land ,
DARBY	Amos	8	5	saying , When will the new moon be gone , that we may sell corn ? and the sabbath , that we may set forth wheat ? making the ephah small and the shekel great , and falsifying the balances for deceit :
DARBY	Amos	8	6	that we may buy the poor for silver , and the needy for a pair of shoes ; and that we may sell the refuse of the wheat .
DARBY	Amos	8	7	Jehovah hath sworn by the glory of Jacob , Certainly I will never forget any of their works .
DARBY	Amos	8	9	And it shall come to pass in that day , saith the Lord Jehovah , that I will cause the sun to go down at noon , and I will darken the land in the clear day .
DARBY	Amos	8	10	And I will turn your feasts into mourning , and all your songs into lamentation ; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins , and baldness upon every head ; and I will make it as the mourning for an only [ son ] , and the end thereof as a bitter day .
DARBY	Amos	8	11	Behold , days come , saith the Lord Jehovah , when I will send a famine in the land ; not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	8	12	And they shall wander from sea to sea , and from the north to the east ; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of Jehovah , and shall not find it .
DARBY	Amos	8	13	In that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst ;
DARBY	Amos	8	14	they that swear by the sin of Samaria , and say , [ As ] thy god , O Dan , liveth ! and , [ As ] the way of Beer-sheba liveth ! even they shall fall , and never rise up again .
DARBY	Amos	9	9	For behold , I command , and I will shake the house of Israel to and fro among all the nations , like as one shaketh [ corn ] in a sieve ; yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth .
DARBY	Amos	9	2	Though they dig into Sheol , thence shall my hand take them ; and though they climb up to the heavens , thence will I bring them down ;
DARBY	Amos	9	3	and though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel , I will search and take them out thence ; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea , there will I command the serpent , and it shall bite them ;
DARBY	Amos	9	4	and though they go into captivity before their enemies , there will I command the sword , and it shall slay them : and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil , and not for good .
DARBY	Amos	9	5	And the Lord Jehovah of hosts is he that toucheth the land , and it melteth , and all that dwell therein shall mourn ; and it shall wholly rise up like the Nile , and sink down as the river of Egypt .
DARBY	Amos	9	6	It is he that buildeth his upper chambers in the heavens , and hath founded his vault upon the earth ; he that calleth for the waters of the sea , and poureth them out upon the face of the earth : Jehovah is his name .
DARBY	Amos	9	7	Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me , O children of Israel ? saith Jehovah . Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt ? and the Philistines from Caphtor , and the Syrians from Kir ?
DARBY	Amos	9	8	Behold , the eyes of the Lord Jehovah are upon the sinful kingdom , and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth : only that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Amos	9	10	All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword , who say , Evil shall not overtake nor befall us .
DARBY	Amos	9	11	In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David which is fallen , and close up the breaches thereof ; and I will raise up its ruins , and I will build it as in the days of old :
DARBY	Amos	9	12	that they may possess the remnant of Edom , and all the nations upon whom my name is called , saith Jehovah who doeth this .
DARBY	Amos	9	13	Behold , the days come , saith Jehovah , when the ploughman shall overtake the reaper , and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed ; and the mountains shall drop new wine , and all the hills shall melt .
DARBY	Amos	9	14	And I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel , and they shall build the waste cities , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and drink the wine thereof ; and they shall make gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
DARBY	Amos	9	15	And I will plant them upon their land , and they shall no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them , saith Jehovah thy God .
DARBY	Obadiah	1	1	The vision of Obadiah . Thus saith the Lord Jehovah concerning Edom : We have heard a report from Jehovah , and an ambassador is sent among the nations . Arise ye , and let us rise up against her in battle .
DARBY	Obadiah	1	2	Behold , I have made thee small among the nations ; thou art greatly despised .
DARBY	Obadiah	1	3	The pride of thy heart hath deceived thee , thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock , whose habitation is high ; —he that saith in his heart , Who shall bring me down to the ground ?
DARBY	Obadiah	1	4	Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle , and though thou set thy nest among the stars , thence will I bring thee down , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Obadiah	1	5	If thieves had come to thee , if robbers by night , ( how art thou cut off ! ) would they not have stolen [ till ] they had had enough ? If grape-gatherers had come to thee , would they not have left some gleanings ?
DARBY	Obadiah	1	6	How is Esau searched ! his hidden things sought out !
DARBY	Obadiah	1	7	All the men of thy confederacy have pushed thee to the border ; the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee , they have prevailed against thee ; [ they that eat ] thy bread have laid a snare under thee . There is no understanding in him .
DARBY	Obadiah	1	8	Shall I not in that day , saith Jehovah , destroy the wise men out of Edom , and understanding out of the mount of Esau ?
DARBY	Obadiah	1	9	And thy mighty men , O Teman , shall be dismayed , to the end that every one may be cut off from the mount of Esau by slaughter .
DARBY	Obadiah	1	10	Because of violence against thy brother Jacob , shame shall cover thee , and thou shalt be cut off for ever .
DARBY	Obadiah	1	11	In the day that thou stoodest on the other side , in the day that strangers carried away captive his substance , and foreigners entered into his gates , and cast lots upon Jerusalem , even thou wast as one of them .
DARBY	Obadiah	1	12	But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day of his disaster ; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction ; nor have opened wide thy mouth in the day of distress .
DARBY	Obadiah	1	13	Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity , nor have looked , even thou , on their affliction in the day of their calamity , neither shouldest thou have laid [ hands ] on their substance in the day of their calamity ;
DARBY	Obadiah	1	14	and thou shouldest not have stood on the crossway , to cut off those of his that did escape , nor have delivered up those remaining of him in the day of distress .
DARBY	Obadiah	1	15	For the day of Jehovah is near upon all the nations : as thou hast done , it shall be done unto thee : thy recompence shall return upon thine own head .
DARBY	Obadiah	1	16	For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain , so shall all the nations drink continually ; yea , they shall drink , and shall swallow down , and they shall be as though they had not been .
DARBY	Obadiah	1	17	But upon mount Zion shall there be deliverance , and it shall be holy ; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions .
DARBY	Obadiah	1	18	And the house of Jacob shall be a fire , and the house of Joseph a flame , and the house of Esau for stubble ; and they shall kindle in them and devour them ; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau : for Jehovah hath spoken [ it ] .
DARBY	Obadiah	1	19	And [ they of ] the south shall possess the mount of Esau ; and they of the lowland the Philistines ; yea , they shall possess the field of Ephraim and the field of Samaria ; and Benjamin [ shall possess ] Gilead ;
DARBY	Obadiah	1	20	and the captives of this host of the children of Israel [ shall possess ] what belonged to the Canaanites , unto Zarephath ; and the captives of Jerusalem , who [ were ] in Sepharad , shall possess the cities of the south .
DARBY	Obadiah	1	21	And saviours shall come up on mount Zion , to judge the mount of Esau ; and the kingdom shall be Jehovah 's .
DARBY	Jonah	1	1	And the word of Jehovah came unto Jonah the son of Amittai , saying ,
DARBY	Jonah	1	2	Arise , go to Nineveh , the great city , and cry against it ; for their wickedness is come up before me .
DARBY	Jonah	1	3	But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of Jehovah ; and he went down to Joppa , and found a ship going to Tarshish ; so he paid the fare thereof , and went down into it , to go with them unto Tarshish , from the presence of Jehovah .
DARBY	Jonah	1	4	But Jehovah sent out a great wind upon the sea , and there was a mighty tempest upon the sea , so that the ship was like to be broken .
DARBY	Jonah	1	5	And the mariners were afraid , and cried every one unto his god ; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea , to be lightened of them . But Jonah had gone down into the lower part of the ship ; and he lay , and was fast asleep .
DARBY	Jonah	1	6	And the shipmaster came to him , and said unto him , What meanest thou , sleeper ? arise , call upon thy God ; perhaps God will think upon us , that we perish not .
DARBY	Jonah	1	7	And they said each one to his fellow , Come , and let us cast lots , that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us . And they cast lots , and the lot fell upon Jonah .
DARBY	Jonah	1	8	And they said unto him , Tell us , we pray thee , for whose cause this evil is upon us : what is thine occupation ? and whence comest thou ? what is thy country ? and of what people art thou ?
DARBY	Jonah	1	9	And he said unto them , I am a Hebrew , and I fear Jehovah , the God of the heavens , who hath made the sea and the dry [ land ] .
DARBY	Jonah	1	10	Then were the men exceedingly afraid , and said unto him , What is this thou hast done ? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of Jehovah : for he had told them .
DARBY	Jonah	1	11	And they said unto him , What shall we do unto thee , that the sea may be calm unto us ? for the sea grew more and more tempestuous .
DARBY	Jonah	1	12	And he said unto them , Take me up , and cast me forth into the sea ; so shall the sea be calm unto you : for I know that because of me this great tempest is upon you .
DARBY	Jonah	1	13	But the men rowed hard to regain the land ; but they could not ; for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them .
DARBY	Jonah	1	14	And they cried unto Jehovah and said , Ah , Jehovah , we beseech thee , let us not perish for this man 's life , and lay not upon us innocent blood : for thou , Jehovah , hast done as it pleased thee .
DARBY	Jonah	1	15	And they took up Jonah , and cast him forth into the sea : and the sea ceased from its raging .
DARBY	Jonah	1	16	And the men feared Jehovah exceedingly , and offered a sacrifice unto Jehovah , and made vows .
DARBY	Jonah	1	17	And Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah . And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights .
DARBY	Jonah	2	2	and he said : I cried by reason of my distress unto Jehovah , and he answered me ; Out of the belly of Sheol cried I : thou heardest my voice .
DARBY	Jonah	2	3	For thou didst cast me into the depth , into the heart of the seas , And the flood was round about me : All thy breakers and thy billows are gone over me .
DARBY	Jonah	2	4	And I said , I am cast out from before thine eyes , Yet will I look again toward thy holy temple .
DARBY	Jonah	2	5	The waters encompassed me , to the soul : The deep was round about me , The weeds were wrapped about my head .
DARBY	Jonah	2	6	I went down to the bottoms of the mountains ; The bars of the earth [ closed ] upon me for ever : But thou hast brought up my life from the pit , O Jehovah my God .
DARBY	Jonah	2	7	When my soul fainted within me , I remembered Jehovah ; And my prayer came in unto thee , Into thy holy temple .
DARBY	Jonah	2	8	They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy .
DARBY	Jonah	2	9	But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving ; I will pay that which I have vowed . Salvation is of Jehovah .
DARBY	Jonah	2	10	And Jehovah commanded the fish , and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry [ land ] .
DARBY	Jonah	3	3	And Jonah arose , and went unto Nineveh , according to the word of Jehovah . Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days ' journey .
DARBY	Jonah	3	2	Arise , go to Nineveh , the great city , and preach unto it the preaching that I shall bid thee .
DARBY	Jonah	3	4	And Jonah began to enter into the city a day 's journey , and he cried and said , Yet forty days , and Nineveh shall be overthrown !
DARBY	Jonah	3	5	And the men of Nineveh believed God , and proclaimed a fast , and put on sackcloth , from the greatest of them even to the least of them .
DARBY	Jonah	3	6	And the word reached the king of Nineveh , and he arose from his throne , and laid his robe from him , and covered himself with sackcloth , and sat in ashes .
DARBY	Jonah	3	7	And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles , saying , Let neither man nor beast , herd nor flock , taste anything : let them not feed , nor drink water ;
DARBY	Jonah	3	8	and let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto God ; and let them turn every one from his evil way , and from the violence that is in their hands .
DARBY	Jonah	3	9	Who knoweth but that God will turn and repent , and will turn away from his fierce anger , that we perish not ?
DARBY	Jonah	3	10	And God saw their works , that they turned from their evil way ; and God repented of the evil that he had said he would do unto them , and he did [ it ] not .
DARBY	Jonah	4	4	And Jehovah said , Doest thou well to be angry ?
DARBY	Jonah	4	2	And he prayed unto Jehovah , and said , Ah , Jehovah , was not this my saying when I was yet in my country ? Therefore I was minded to flee at first unto Tarshish ; for I knew that thou art a gracious God , and merciful , slow to anger , and of great loving-kindness , and repentest thee of the evil .
DARBY	Jonah	4	3	And now , Jehovah , take , I beseech thee , my life from me , for it is better for me to die than to live .
DARBY	Jonah	4	5	And Jonah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made him a booth , and sat under it in the shade , till he might see what would become of the city .
DARBY	Jonah	4	6	And Jehovah Elohim prepared a gourd , and made it to come up over Jonah , that it might be a shade over his head , to deliver him from his trouble . And Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd .
DARBY	Jonah	4	7	But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day , and it smote the gourd , that it withered .
DARBY	Jonah	4	8	And it came to pass , when the sun arose , that God prepared a sultry east wind ; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah , so that he fainted ; and he requested for himself that he might die , and said , It is better for me to die than to live .
DARBY	Jonah	4	9	And God said to Jonah , Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd ? And he said , I do well to be angry , unto death .
DARBY	Jonah	4	10	And Jehovah said , Thou hast pity on the gourd , for which thou hast not laboured , neither madest it grow ; which came up in a night , and perished in a night :
DARBY	Jonah	4	11	and I , should not I have pity on Nineveh , the great city , wherein are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons that can not discern between their right hand and their left hand ; and also much cattle ?
DARBY	Micah	1	1	The word of Jehovah that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham , Ahaz , [ and ] Hezekiah , kings of Judah , which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem .
DARBY	Micah	1	2	Hear , ye peoples , all of you ; hearken , O earth , and all that is therein : and let the Lord Jehovah be witness against you , the Lord from his holy temple !
DARBY	Micah	1	3	For behold , Jehovah cometh forth out of his place , and will come down , and tread upon the high places of the earth .
DARBY	Micah	1	4	And the mountains shall be melted under him , and the valleys shall be cleft , as wax before the fire , as waters poured down a steep place .
DARBY	Micah	1	5	For the transgression of Jacob is all this , and for the sins of the house of Israel . Whence is the transgression of Jacob ? is it not [ from ] Samaria ? And whence are the high places of Judah ? are they not [ from ] Jerusalem ?
DARBY	Micah	1	6	Therefore will I make Samaria as a heap of the field , as plantings of a vineyard ; and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley , and I will lay bare the foundations thereof .
DARBY	Micah	1	7	And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces , and all her harlot-gifts shall be burned with fire , and all her idols will I make a desolation ; for of the hire of a harlot hath she gathered [ them ] , and to a harlot 's hire shall they return .
DARBY	Micah	1	8	For this will I lament , and I will howl ; I will go stripped and naked : I will make a wailing like the jackals , and mourning like the ostriches .
DARBY	Micah	1	9	For her wounds are incurable ; for it is come even unto Judah , it reacheth unto the gate of my people , even to Jerusalem .
DARBY	Micah	1	10	Tell it not in Gath , weep not at all ; at Beth-le-aphrah roll thyself in the dust .
DARBY	Micah	1	11	Pass away , inhabitress of Shaphir , in nakedness [ and ] shame . The inhabitress of Zaanan is not come forth for the lamentation of Beth-ezel : he will take from you its shelter .
DARBY	Micah	1	12	For the inhabitress of Maroth waited anxiously for good ; but evil hath come down from Jehovah unto the gate of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Micah	1	13	Bind the chariot to the swift steed , O inhabitress of Lachish : she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion ; for in thee were found the transgressions of Israel .
DARBY	Micah	1	14	Therefore shalt thou give parting-gifts to Moresheth-Gath : the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel .
DARBY	Micah	1	15	I will yet bring unto thee an heir , O inhabitress of Mareshah ; the glory of Israel shall come even unto Adullam .
DARBY	Micah	1	16	Make thee bald , and poll thee for the children of thy delights ; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle , for they are gone into captivity from thee .
DARBY	Micah	2	2	And they covet fields , and take them by violence ; and houses , and take them away ; and they oppress a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
DARBY	Micah	2	3	Therefore thus saith Jehovah : Behold , against this family do I devise an evil , from which ye shall not remove your necks ; neither shall ye walk haughtily : for it is an evil time .
DARBY	Micah	2	4	In that day shall they take up a proverb concerning you , and lament with a doleful lamentation , [ and ] say , We are utterly spoiled : he hath changed the portion of my people : how hath he removed it from me ! He hath distributed our fields to the rebellious .
DARBY	Micah	2	5	Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the measuring line upon a lot , in the congregation of Jehovah .
DARBY	Micah	2	6	Prophesy ye not , they prophesy . If they do not prophesy to these , the ignominy will not depart .
DARBY	Micah	2	7	O thou [ that art ] named the house of Jacob , Is Jehovah impatient ? are these his doings ? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly ?
DARBY	Micah	2	8	But of late my people is risen up as an enemy : ye strip off the mantle with the garment from them that pass by securely , that are averse from war .
DARBY	Micah	2	9	The women of my people do ye cast out from their pleasant houses ; from their young children do ye take away my magnificence for ever .
DARBY	Micah	2	10	Arise ye , and depart ; for this is not the resting-place , because of defilement that bringeth destruction , even a grievous destruction .
DARBY	Micah	2	11	If a man walking in wind and falsehood do lie , [ saying , ] I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink , he shall be the prophet of this people .
DARBY	Micah	2	12	I will surely assemble , O Jacob , the whole of thee ; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel ; I will put them together as sheep of Bozrah , as a flock in the midst of their pasture : they shall make great noise by reason of [ the multitude of ] men .
DARBY	Micah	2	13	One that breaketh through is gone up before them : they have broken forth , and have passed on to the gate , and are gone out by it ; and their king passeth on before them , and Jehovah at the head of them .
DARBY	Micah	3	3	and who eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them , and break their bones , and chop them in pieces as for the pot , and as flesh within the cauldron .
DARBY	Micah	3	2	Ye who hate the good , and love evil ; who pluck off their skin from them , and their flesh from off their bones ;
DARBY	Micah	3	4	Then shall they cry unto Jehovah , but he will not answer them ; and he will hide his face from them at that time , according as they have wrought evil in their doings .
DARBY	Micah	3	5	Thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that cause my people to err , that bite with their teeth , and cry , Peace ! but whoso putteth not into their mouths they prepare war against him :
DARBY	Micah	3	6	therefore ye shall have night without a vision ; and it shall be dark unto you , without divination ; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets , and the day shall be black over them .
DARBY	Micah	3	7	And the seers shall be ashamed , and the diviners confounded ; and they shall all cover their lips , for there will be no answer of God .
DARBY	Micah	3	8	But truly I am filled with power by the Spirit of Jehovah , and with judgment and with might , to declare unto Jacob his transgression , and to Israel his sin .
DARBY	Micah	3	9	Hear this , I pray you , ye heads of the house of Jacob , and princes of the house of Israel , that abhor judgment , and pervert all equity ,
DARBY	Micah	3	10	that build up Zion with blood , and Jerusalem with unrighteousness .
DARBY	Micah	3	11	The heads thereof judge for reward , and the priests thereof teach for hire , and the prophets thereof divine for money ; yet do they lean upon Jehovah , and say , Is not Jehovah in the midst of us ? no evil shall come upon us .
DARBY	Micah	3	12	Therefore shall Zion for your sake be ploughed [ as ] a field , and Jerusalem shall become heaps , and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest .
DARBY	Micah	4	4	And they shall sit every one under his vine , and under his fig-tree ; and there shall be none to make [ them ] afraid : for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken [ it ] .
DARBY	Micah	4	2	And many nations shall go and say , Come , and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah , and to the house of the God of Jacob ; and he will teach us of his ways , and we will walk in his paths . For out of Zion shall go forth the law , and Jehovah 's word from Jerusalem .
DARBY	Micah	4	3	And he shall judge among many peoples , and reprove strong nations , even afar off ; and they shall forge their swords into ploughshares , and their spears into pruning-knives : nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
DARBY	Micah	4	5	For all the peoples will walk every one in the name of his god ; but we will walk in the name of Jehovah , our God for ever and ever .
DARBY	Micah	4	6	In that day , saith Jehovah , will I assemble her that halteth , and I will gather her that is driven out , and her that I have afflicted ;
DARBY	Micah	4	7	and I will make her that halted a remnant , and her that was cast far off a strong nation ; and Jehovah shall reign over them in mount Zion , from henceforth even for ever .
DARBY	Micah	4	8	And thou , O tower of the flock , hill of the daughter of Zion , unto thee shall it come , yea , the first dominion shall come , —the kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem .
DARBY	Micah	4	9	Now why dost thou cry out aloud ? Is there no king in thee ? is thy counsellor perished , that pangs have seized thee as a woman in travail ?
DARBY	Micah	4	10	Be in pain , and labour to bring forth , O daughter of Zion , like a woman in travail ; for now shalt thou go forth out of the city , and thou shalt dwell in the field , and thou shalt go even to Babylon : there shalt thou be delivered ; there Jehovah will redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies .
DARBY	Micah	4	11	And now many nations are assembled against thee , that say , Let her be profaned , and let our eye look upon Zion .
DARBY	Micah	4	12	But they know not the thoughts of Jehovah , neither understand they his counsel ; for he hath gathered them together as the sheaves into the threshing-floor .
DARBY	Micah	4	13	Arise and thresh , daughter of Zion , for I will make thy horn iron , and I will make thy hoofs brass ; and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples ; and I will devote their gain to Jehovah , and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth .
DARBY	Micah	5	5	And this [ man ] shall be Peace . When the Assyrian shall come into our land , and when he shall tread in our palaces , then shall we raise against him seven shepherds , and eight princes of men .
DARBY	Micah	5	2	( And thou , Bethlehem Ephratah , little to be among the thousands of Judah , out of thee shall he come forth unto me [ who is ] to be Ruler in Israel : whose goings forth are from of old , from the days of eternity . )
DARBY	Micah	5	3	Therefore will he give them up , until the time when she which travaileth shall have brought forth : and the residue of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel .
DARBY	Micah	5	4	And he shall stand and feed [ his flock ] in the strength of Jehovah , in the majesty of the name of Jehovah his God . And they shall abide ; for now shall he be great even unto the ends of the earth .
DARBY	Micah	5	6	And they shall waste the land of Asshur with the sword , and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof ; and he shall deliver [ us ] from the Assyrian , when he cometh into our land , and when he treadeth within our borders .
DARBY	Micah	5	7	And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as dew from Jehovah , as showers upon the grass , that tarrieth not for man , neither waiteth for the sons of men .
DARBY	Micah	5	8	And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations , in the midst of many peoples , as a lion among the beasts of the forest , as a young lion among the flocks of sheep : who , if he go through , treadeth down , and teareth in pieces , and there is none to deliver .
DARBY	Micah	5	9	Thy hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries , and all thine enemies shall be cut off .
DARBY	Micah	5	10	And it shall come to pass in that day , saith Jehovah , that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee , and I will destroy thy chariots .
DARBY	Micah	5	11	And I will cut off the cities of thy land , and overthrow all thy strongholds .
DARBY	Micah	5	12	And I will cut off sorceries out of thy hand ; and thou shalt have no soothsayers .
DARBY	Micah	5	13	Thy graven images also will I cut off , and thy statues out of the midst of thee ; and thou shalt no more bow down to the work of thy hands .
DARBY	Micah	5	14	And I will pluck up thine Asherahs out of the midst of thee , and I will destroy thy cities .
DARBY	Micah	5	15	And I will execute vengeance in anger and in fury upon the nations , such as they have not heard of .
DARBY	Micah	6	6	Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah , bow myself before the high God ? Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings , with calves of a year old ?
DARBY	Micah	6	2	Hear , ye mountains , Jehovah 's controversy , and ye , unchanging foundations of the earth ; for Jehovah hath a controversy with his people , and he will plead with Israel .
DARBY	Micah	6	3	O my people , what have I done unto thee ? and wherein have I wearied thee ? testify against me .
DARBY	Micah	6	4	For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt , and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage ; and I sent before thee Moses , Aaron , and Miriam .
DARBY	Micah	6	5	My people , remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted , and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him , from Shittim unto Gilgal , that ye may know the righteousness of Jehovah .
DARBY	Micah	6	7	Will Jehovah take pleasure in thousands of rams , in ten thousands of rivers of oil ? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression , the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ?
DARBY	Micah	6	8	He hath shewn thee , O man , what is good : and what doth Jehovah require of thee , but to do justly , and to love goodness , and to walk humbly with thy God ?
DARBY	Micah	6	9	Jehovah 's voice crieth unto the city , and wisdom looketh on thy name . Hear ye the rod , and who hath appointed it .
DARBY	Micah	6	10	Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked , and the scant measure [ which is ] abominable ?
DARBY	Micah	6	11	Shall I be pure with the unjust balances , and with the bag of deceitful weights ?
DARBY	Micah	6	12	For her rich men are full of violence , and her inhabitants speak lies , and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth .
DARBY	Micah	6	13	Therefore also will I make [ thee ] sick in smiting thee ; I will make [ thee ] desolate because of thy sins .
DARBY	Micah	6	14	Thou shalt eat , and not be satisfied , and thine emptiness [ shall remain ] in the midst of thee ; and thou shalt take away , and not save ; and what thou savest will I give up to the sword .
DARBY	Micah	6	15	Thou shalt sow , but thou shalt not reap ; thou shalt tread the olives , but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil ; and new wine , but shalt not drink wine .
DARBY	Micah	6	16	For the statutes of Omri are kept , and all the works of the house of Ahab ; and ye walk in their counsels : that I should make thee a desolation , and the inhabitants thereof a hissing ; and ye shall bear the reproach of my people .
DARBY	Micah	7	7	But as for me , I will look unto Jehovah ; I will wait for the God of my salvation : my God will hear me .
DARBY	Micah	7	2	The godly [ man ] hath perished out of the land , and there is none upright among men : they all lie in wait for blood , they hunt every man his brother with a net .
DARBY	Micah	7	3	Both hands are for evil , to do it well . The prince asketh , and the judge [ is there ] for a reward ; and the great [ man ] uttereth his soul 's greed : and [ together ] they combine it .
DARBY	Micah	7	4	The best of them is as a briar ; the most upright , [ worse ] than a thorn-fence . The day of thy watchmen , thy visitation is come ; now shall be their perplexity .
DARBY	Micah	7	5	Believe ye not in a companion , put not confidence in a familiar friend : keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom .
DARBY	Micah	7	6	For the son dishonoureth the father , the daughter riseth up against her mother , the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law : a man 's enemies are the men of his own household .
DARBY	Micah	7	8	Rejoice not against me , O mine enemy : though I fall , I shall arise ; when I sit in darkness , Jehovah shall be a light unto me .
DARBY	Micah	7	9	I will bear the indignation of Jehovah—for I have sinned against him—until he plead my cause , and execute judgment for me : he will bring me forth to the light ; I shall behold his righteousness .
DARBY	Micah	7	10	And mine enemy shall see [ it ] , and shame shall cover her which said unto me , Where is Jehovah thy God ? Mine eyes shall behold her ; now shall she be trodden down , as the mire of the streets .
DARBY	Micah	7	11	In the day when thy walls shall be built , on that day shall the established limit recede .
DARBY	Micah	7	12	In that day they shall come to thee from Assyria and the cities of Egypt , and from Egypt to the river , and from sea to sea , and from mountain to mountain .
DARBY	Micah	7	13	But the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein , for the fruit of their doings .
DARBY	Micah	7	14	Feed thy people with thy rod , the flock of thine inheritance , dwelling alone in the forest , in the midst of Carmel : let them feed in Bashan and Gilead , as in the days of old .
DARBY	Micah	7	15	—As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt , will I shew them marvellous things .
DARBY	Micah	7	16	—The nations shall see , and be ashamed for all their might : they shall lay [ their ] hand upon [ their ] mouth , their ears shall be deaf .
DARBY	Micah	7	17	They shall lick dust like the serpent ; like crawling things of the earth , they shall come trembling forth from their close places . They shall turn with fear to Jehovah our God , and shall be afraid because of thee .
DARBY	Micah	7	18	Who is a God like unto thee , that forgiveth iniquity , and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage ? He retaineth not his anger for ever , because he delighteth in loving-kindness .
DARBY	Micah	7	19	He will yet again have compassion on us , he will tread under foot our iniquities : and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea .
DARBY	Micah	7	20	Thou wilt perform truth to Jacob , loving-kindness to Abraham , which thou hast sworn unto our fathers , from the days of old .
DARBY	Nahum	1	1	The burden of Nineveh . The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite .
DARBY	Nahum	1	2	A jealous and avenging God is Jehovah : an avenger is Jehovah , and full of fury : Jehovah taketh vengeance on his adversaries , and he reserveth [ wrath ] for his enemies .
DARBY	Nahum	1	3	Jehovah is slow to anger , and great in power , and doth not at all clear [ the guilty ] : Jehovah , —his way is in the whirlwind and in the storm , and the clouds are the dust of his feet .
DARBY	Nahum	1	4	He rebuketh the sea , and maketh it dry , and drieth up all the rivers : Bashan languisheth , and Carmel , and the flower of Lebanon languisheth .
DARBY	Nahum	1	5	The mountains quake before him , and the hills melt , and the earth is upheaved at his presence , and the world , and all that dwell therein .
DARBY	Nahum	1	6	Who shall stand before his indignation ? and who shall abide in the fierceness of his anger ? His fury is poured out like fire , and the rocks are broken asunder by him .
DARBY	Nahum	1	7	Jehovah is good , a stronghold in the day of trouble ; and he knoweth them that trust in him .
DARBY	Nahum	1	8	But with an overrunning flood he will make a full end of the place thereof , and darkness shall pursue his enemies .
DARBY	Nahum	1	9	What do ye imagine against Jehovah ? He will make a full end : trouble shall not rise up the second time .
DARBY	Nahum	1	10	Though they be tangled together [ as ] thorns , and be as drenched from their drink , they shall be devoured as dry stubble , completely .
DARBY	Nahum	1	11	Out of thee is gone forth one that imagineth evil against Jehovah , a wicked counsellor .
DARBY	Nahum	1	12	Thus saith Jehovah : Though they be complete in number , and many as they be , even so shall they be cut down , and he shall pass away ; and though I have afflicted thee , I will afflict thee no more .
DARBY	Nahum	1	13	And now will I break his yoke from off thee , and will burst thy bonds asunder .
DARBY	Nahum	1	14	And Jehovah hath given commandment concerning thee , that no more of thy name be sown : out of the house of thy god will I cut off the graven image , and the molten image : I will prepare thy grave ; for thou art vile .
DARBY	Nahum	1	15	Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth glad tidings , that publisheth peace ! Celebrate thy feasts , Judah , perform thy vows : for the wicked one shall no more pass through thee ; he is utterly cut off .
DARBY	Nahum	2	2	For Jehovah hath brought again the glory of Jacob , as the glory of Israel ; for the wasters have wasted them , and marred their vine-branches .
DARBY	Nahum	2	3	The shield of his mighty men is made red , the valiant men are in scarlet : the chariots [ glitter ] with the sheen of steel , in the day of his preparation , and the spears are brandished .
DARBY	Nahum	2	4	The chariots rush madly in the streets , they justle one against another in the broad ways : the appearance of them is like torches , they run like lightnings .
DARBY	Nahum	2	5	He bethinketh him of his nobles : they stumble in their march ; they make haste to the wall thereof , and the shelter is prepared .
DARBY	Nahum	2	6	The gates of the rivers are opened , and the palace melteth away .
DARBY	Nahum	2	7	And it is decreed : she shall be uncovered , she shall be led away , and her maids shall moan as with the voice of doves , drumming upon their breasts .
DARBY	Nahum	2	8	Nineveh hath been like a pool of water , since the day she existed , yet they flee away . … Stand ! Stand ! But none looketh back .
DARBY	Nahum	2	9	Plunder the silver , plunder the gold ; for there is no end of the splendid store of all precious vessels .
DARBY	Nahum	2	10	She is empty , and void , and waste ; and the heart melteth , and the knees smite together , and writhing pain is in all loins , and all their faces grow pale .
DARBY	Nahum	2	11	Where is [ now ] the den of the lions , and the feeding-place of the young lions , where the lion , the lioness , [ and ] the lion 's whelp walked , and none made them afraid ?
DARBY	Nahum	2	12	The lion tore in pieces enough for his whelps , and strangled for his lionesses , and filled his holes with prey , and his dens with ravin .
DARBY	Nahum	2	13	Behold , I am against thee , saith Jehovah of hosts : and I will burn her chariots into smoke ; and the sword shall devour thy young lions , and I will cut off thy prey from the earth ; and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard .
DARBY	Nahum	3	3	The horseman springing up , and the glitter of the sword , and the flash of the spear , and a multitude of slain , and a mass of carcases , and no end of corpses : they stumble over their corpses .
DARBY	Nahum	3	2	The crack of the whip , and the noise of the rattling of the wheels , and of the prancing horses , and of the bounding chariots !
DARBY	Nahum	3	4	—Because of the multitude of the fornications of the well-favoured harlot , mistress of sorceries , that selleth nations through her fornications , and families through her sorceries ,
DARBY	Nahum	3	5	behold , I am against thee , saith Jehovah of hosts ; and I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face , and I will shew the nations thy nakedness , and the kingdoms thy shame .
DARBY	Nahum	3	6	And I will cast abominable filth upon thee , and make thee vile , and will set thee as a gazing stock .
DARBY	Nahum	3	7	And it shall come to pass , [ that ] all they that see thee shall flee from thee , and shall say , Nineveh is laid waste ! Who will bemoan her ? whence shall I seek comforters for thee ?
DARBY	Nahum	3	8	Art thou better than No-Amon , that was situate among the rivers , [ that had ] the waters round about her , whose rampart was the sea , [ and ] of the sea was her wall ?
DARBY	Nahum	3	9	Ethiopia was her strength , and Egypt , and it was infinite ; Phut and the Libyans were her helpers .
DARBY	Nahum	3	10	She too was carried away , she went into captivity : her infants also were dashed in pieces , at the top of all the streets ; and they cast lots for her honourable men , and all her great men were bound with chains .
DARBY	Nahum	3	11	Thou also shalt be drunken : thou shalt be hid ; thou also shalt seek a refuge from the enemy .
DARBY	Nahum	3	12	All thy strongholds are [ like ] fig-trees with the first-ripe figs : if they be shaken , they even fall into the mouth of the eater .
DARBY	Nahum	3	13	Behold , thy people in the midst of thee are [ as ] women : the gates of thy land are set wide open unto thine enemies ; the fire devoureth thy bars .
DARBY	Nahum	3	14	Draw thee water for the siege , strengthen thy fortresses ; go into the clay , and tread the mortar , make strong the brick-kiln .
DARBY	Nahum	3	15	There shall the fire devour thee ; the sword shall cut thee off ; it shall devour thee like the cankerworm . Make thyself many as the cankerworm , make thyself many as the locust .
DARBY	Nahum	3	16	Thou hast multiplied thy merchants more than the stars of the heavens ; the cankerworm spreadeth himself out and flieth away .
DARBY	Nahum	3	17	Thy chosen men are as the locusts , and thy captains as swarms of grasshoppers , which camp in the hedges in the cold day : when the sun ariseth they flee away , and their place is not known where they are .
DARBY	Nahum	3	18	Thy shepherds slumber , O king of Assyria ; thy nobles lie still ; thy people are scattered upon the mountains , and no man gathereth them .
DARBY	Nahum	3	19	There is no healing of thy breach ; thy wound is grievous ; all that hear the report of thee clap the hands over thee ; for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually ?
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	1	The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see .
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	2	Jehovah , how long shall I cry and thou wilt not hear ? I cry out unto thee , Violence ! and thou dost not save .
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	3	Why dost thou cause me to see iniquity , and lookest thou upon grievance ? For spoiling and violence are before me ; and there is strife , and contention riseth up .
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	4	Therefore the law is powerless , and justice doth never go forth ; for the wicked encompasseth the righteous ; therefore judgment goeth forth perverted .
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	5	See ye among the nations , and behold , and wonder marvellously ; for [ I ] work a work in your days , which ye will not believe , though it be declared [ to you ] .
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	6	For behold , I raise up the Chaldeans , that bitter and impetuous nation , which marcheth through the breadth of the earth , to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs .
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	7	They are terrible and dreadful : their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves .
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	8	And their horses are swifter than the leopards , and are more agile than the evening wolves ; and their horsemen prance proudly , and their horsemen come from afar : they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour .
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	9	They come all of them for violence : the crowd of their faces is forwards , and they gather captives as the sand .
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	10	Yea , he scoffeth at kings , and princes are a scorn unto him ; he derideth every stronghold : for he heapeth up dust , and taketh it .
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	11	Then will his mind change , and he will pass on , and become guilty : this his power is become his +god .
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	12	—Art thou not from everlasting , Jehovah my God , my Holy One ? We shall not die . Jehovah , thou hast ordained him for judgment ; and thou , O Rock , hast appointed him for correction .
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	13	[ Thou art ] of purer eyes than to behold evil , and canst not look on mischief : wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously , [ and ] keepest silence when the wicked swalloweth up a [ man ] more righteous than he ?
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	14	And thou makest men as the fishes of the sea , as the creeping things , that have no ruler over them .
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	15	He taketh up all of them with the hook , he catcheth them in his net , and gathereth them into his drag ; therefore he rejoiceth and is glad :
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	16	therefore he sacrificeth unto his net , and burneth incense unto his drag ; for by them his portion is become fat , and his meat dainty .
DARBY	Habakkuk	1	17	Shall he therefore empty his net , and not spare to slay the nations continually ?
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	2	And Jehovah answered me and said , Write the vision , and engrave it upon tablets , that he may run that readeth it .
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	3	For the vision is yet for an appointed time , but it hasteth to the end , and shall not lie : though it tarry , wait for it ; for it will surely come , it will not delay .
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	4	Behold , his soul is puffed up , it is not upright within him : but the just shall live by his faith .
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	5	And moreover , the wine is treacherous : he is a proud man , and keepeth not at rest , he enlargeth his desire as Sheol , and he is like death and can not be satisfied ; and he assembleth unto him all nations , and gathereth unto him all peoples .
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	6	Shall not all these take up a proverb about him , and a taunting riddle against him , and say , Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his ! how long ? —and to him that loadeth himself with pledges !
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	7	Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee , and they awake up that shall vex thee , and thou shalt be for booties unto them ?
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	8	Because thou hast plundered many nations , all the rest of the peoples shall plunder thee ; because of men 's blood , and for the violence [ done ] to the land , to the city , and all that dwell therein .
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	9	Woe to him that getteth iniquitous gain to his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the grasp of evil !
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	10	Thou hast devised shame to thy house , by cutting off many peoples , and hast sinned against thine own soul .
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	11	For the stone shall cry out of the wall , and the beam out of the timber shall answer it .
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	12	Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood , and establisheth a city by unrighteousness !
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	13	Behold , is it not of Jehovah of hosts that the peoples labour for the fire , and the nations weary themselves in vain ?
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	14	For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea .
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	15	Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink , —that pourest out thy flask , and makest [ him ] drunken also , that thou mayest look on their nakedness !
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	16	Thou art filled with shame instead of glory ; drink thou also , and let thy foreskin be uncovered : the cup of Jehovah 's right hand shall be turned unto thee , and a shameful spewing shall be on thy glory .
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	17	For the violence [ done ] to Lebanon shall cover thee , and the destruction of beasts which made them afraid ; because of men 's blood , and for the violence [ done ] to the land , to the city , and all that dwell therein .
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	18	What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it ? the molten image , and the teacher of falsehood , that the maker of his work dependeth thereon , to make dumb idols ?
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	19	Woe unto him that saith to the wood , Awake ! to the dumb stone , Arise ! Shall it teach ? Behold it is overlaid with gold and silver , and there is no breath at all in the midst of it .
DARBY	Habakkuk	2	20	But Jehovah is in his holy temple . Let all the earth keep silence before him !
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	3	+God came from Teman , And the Holy One from mount Paran . Selah . His glory covereth the heavens , And the earth is full of his praise .
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	2	Jehovah , I heard the report of thee , [ and ] I feared . Jehovah , revive thy work in the midst of the years , In the midst of the years make [ it ] known : In wrath remember mercy !
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	4	And [ his ] brightness was as the light ; Rays [ came forth ] from his hand ; And there was the hiding of his power .
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	5	Before him went the pestilence , And a burning flame went forth at his feet .
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	6	He stood , and measured the earth ; He beheld , and discomfited the nations ; And the eternal mountains were scattered , The everlasting hills gave way : His ways are everlasting .
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	7	I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction ; The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble .
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	8	Was Jehovah wrathful with the rivers ? Was thine anger against the rivers ? Was thy rage against the sea , That thou didst ride upon thy horses , Thy chariots of salvation ?
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	9	Thy bow was made naked , The rods [ of discipline ] sworn according to [ thy ] word . Selah . Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers .
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	10	The mountains saw thee , they were in travail : Torrents of waters passed by ; The deep uttered its voice , Lifted up its hands on high .
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	11	The sun [ and ] moon stood still in their habitation , At the light of thine arrows which shot forth , —At the shining of thy glittering spear .
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	12	Thou didst march through the land in indignation , Thou didst thresh the nations in anger .
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	13	Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people , For the salvation of thine anointed ; Thou didst smite off the head from the house of the wicked , Laying bare the foundation even to the neck . Selah .
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	14	Thou didst strike through with his own spears the head of his leaders : They came out as a whirlwind to scatter me , Whose exulting was as to devour the afflicted secretly .
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	15	Thou didst walk through the sea with thy horses , The heap of great waters .
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	16	I heard , and my belly trembled ; My lips quivered at the voice ; Rottenness entered into my bones , and I trembled in my place , That I might rest in the day of distress , When their invader shall come up against the people .
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	17	For though the fig-tree shall not blossom , Neither shall fruit be in the vines ; The labour of the olive-tree shall fail , And the fields shall yield no food ; The flock shall be cut off from the fold , And there shall be no herd in the stalls :
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	18	Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah , I will joy in the God of my salvation .
DARBY	Habakkuk	3	19	Jehovah , the Lord , is my strength , And he maketh my feet like hinds ' [ feet ] , And he will make me to walk upon my high places . To the chief Musician . On my stringed instruments .
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	1	The word of Jehovah that came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi , the son of Gedaliah , the son of Amariah , the son of Hezekiah , in the days of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah .
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	2	I will utterly take away everything from off the face of the ground , saith Jehovah :
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	3	I will take away man and beast ; I will take away the fowl of the heavens and the fishes of the sea , and the stumbling-blocks with the wicked , and I will cut off mankind from off the face of the ground , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	4	And I will stretch forth my hand upon Judah , and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place , the name of the Chemarim with the priests ;
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	5	and them that bow down to the host of the heavens upon the housetops ; and them that bow down to Jehovah , that swear by [ him ] , and swear by Malcham ;
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	6	and them that turn back from after Jehovah , and that do not seek Jehovah , nor inquire for him .
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	7	Be silent at the presence of the Lord Jehovah ; for the day of Jehovah is at hand ; for Jehovah hath prepared a sacrifice , he hath hallowed his guests .
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	8	And it shall come to pass in the day of Jehovah 's sacrifice , that I will punish the princes , and the king 's sons , and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel .
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	9	And in that day will I punish all those that leap over the threshold , who fill their master 's house with violence and deceit .
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	10	And in that day , saith Jehovah , there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish-gate , and a howling from the second [ quarter ] , and a great crashing from the hills .
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	11	Howl , ye inhabitants of Maktesh ; for all the people of Canaan are cut down , all they that are laden with silver are cut off .
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	12	And it shall come to pass at that time , [ that ] I will search Jerusalem with lamps , and punish the men that are settled on their lees , that say in their heart , Jehovah will not do good , neither will he do evil .
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	13	And their wealth shall become a booty , and their houses a desolation ; and they shall build houses , and not inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and not drink the wine thereof .
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	14	The great day of Jehovah is near , it is near , and hasteth greatly . The voice of the day of Jehovah : the mighty man shall cry there bitterly .
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	15	That day is a day of wrath , a day of trouble and distress , a day of ruin and desolation , a day of darkness and gloom , a day of clouds and gross darkness ,
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	16	a day of the trumpet and alarm , against the fenced cities and against the high battlements .
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	17	And I will bring distress upon men , and they shall walk like blind men ; for they have sinned against Jehovah ; and their blood shall be poured out as dust , and their flesh as dung :
DARBY	Zephaniah	1	18	their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them , in the day of Jehovah 's wrath ; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy : for a full end , yea , a sudden [ end ] , shall he make of all them that dwell in the land .
DARBY	Zephaniah	2	2	before the decree bring forth , [ before ] the day pass away as chaff , before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you , before the day of Jehovah 's anger come upon you .
DARBY	Zephaniah	2	3	Seek Jehovah , all ye meek of the land , who have performed his ordinance ; seek righteousness , seek meekness : it may be ye shall be hid in the day of Jehovah 's anger .
DARBY	Zephaniah	2	4	For Gazah shall be forsaken , and Ashkelon shall be a desolation ; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday , and Ekron shall be rooted up .
DARBY	Zephaniah	2	5	Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast , the nation of the Cherethites ! The word of Jehovah is against you , O Canaan , land of the Philistines : I will destroy thee , that there shall be no inhabitant ;
DARBY	Zephaniah	2	6	and the sea-coast shall be cave-dwellings for shepherds , and folds for flocks .
DARBY	Zephaniah	2	7	And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah ; they shall feed thereon : in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening : for Jehovah their God shall visit them , and turn again their captivity .
DARBY	Zephaniah	2	8	I have heard the reproach of Moab , and the revilings of the children of Ammon , wherewith they have reproached my people , and magnified themselves against their border .
DARBY	Zephaniah	2	9	Therefore , [ as ] I live , saith Jehovah of hosts , the God of Israel , Moab shall certainly be as Sodom , and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah , a possession of nettles , and salt-pits , and a perpetual desolation ; the remnant of my people shall spoil them , and the residue of my nation shall possess them .
DARBY	Zephaniah	2	10	This shall they have for their pride , because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Zephaniah	2	11	Jehovah will be terrible unto them ; for he will famish all the gods of the earth ; and all the isles of the nations shall worship him , every one from his place .
DARBY	Zephaniah	2	12	Ye Ethiopians also , ye shall be the slain of my sword .
DARBY	Zephaniah	2	13	And he will stretch out his hand against the north , and destroy Assyria ; and will make Nineveh a desolation , a place of drought like the wilderness .
DARBY	Zephaniah	2	14	And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her , all the crowd of beasts ; both the pelican and the bittern shall lodge in the chapiters thereof ; a voice shall sing in the windows ; desolation shall be on the thresholds : for he hath laid bare the cedar work .
DARBY	Zephaniah	2	15	This is the rejoicing city that dwelt in security , that said in her heart , I am , and there is none else beside me : how is she become a desolation , a couching-place for beasts ! Every one that passeth by her shall hiss , shall wave his hand .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	3	Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions ; her judges are evening wolves , that leave nothing for the morning .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	2	She hearkened not to the voice ; she received not correction ; she confided not in Jehovah ; she drew not near her God .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	4	Her prophets are vain-glorious , treacherous persons ; her priests profane the sanctuary , they do violence to the law .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	5	The righteous Jehovah is in the midst of her : he doeth no wrong . Every morning doth he bring his judgment to light ; it faileth not : but the unrighteous knoweth no shame .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	6	I have cut off nations : their battlements are desolate ; I made their streets waste , that none passeth by ; their cities are destroyed , so that there is no man , so that there is no inhabitant .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	7	I said , Only fear me , receive correction ; so her dwelling shall not be cut off , howsoever I may punish her . But they rose early , they corrupted all their doings .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	8	Therefore wait ye for me , saith Jehovah , until the day that I rise up to the prey ; for my determination is to assemble the nations , that I may gather the kingdoms together , to pour upon them mine indignation , —all my fierce anger : for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	9	For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language , that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah , to serve him with one consent .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	10	From beyond the rivers of Cush my suppliants , the daughter of my dispersed , shall bring mine oblation .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	11	In that day thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy doings wherein thou hast transgressed against me ; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that exult in thy pride , and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	12	And I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people , and they shall trust in the name of Jehovah .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	13	The remnant of Israel shall not work unrighteousness , nor speak lies ; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth : but * they * shall feed and lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	14	Exult , O daughter of Zion ; shout , O Israel ; rejoice and be glad with all the heart , O daughter of Jerusalem :
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	15	Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments , he hath cast out thine enemy ; the King of Israel , Jehovah , is in the midst of thee ; thou shalt not see evil any more .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	16	In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem , Fear not ; Zion , let not thy hands be slack .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	17	Jehovah thy God is in thy midst , a mighty one that will save : he will rejoice over thee with joy ; he will rest in his love ; he will exult over thee with singing .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	18	I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assemblies , who were of thee : the reproach of it was a burden [ unto them ] .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	19	Behold , at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee ; and I will save her that halted , and gather her that was driven out ; and I will make them a praise and a name in all the lands where they have been put to shame .
DARBY	Zephaniah	3	20	At that time will I bring you , yea , at the time that I gather you ; for I will make you a name and a praise , among all the peoples of the earth , when I shall turn again your captivity before your eyes , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Haggai	1	1	In the second year of Darius the king , in the sixth month , on the first day of the month , came the word of Jehovah by the prophet Haggai unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , saying ,
DARBY	Haggai	1	2	Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts , saying , This people say , The time is not come , the time that Jehovah 's house should be built .
DARBY	Haggai	1	3	And the word of Jehovah came by Haggai the prophet , saying ,
DARBY	Haggai	1	4	Is it time for you that ye should dwell in your wainscoted houses , while this house lieth waste ?
DARBY	Haggai	1	5	And now thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Consider your ways .
DARBY	Haggai	1	6	Ye have sown much , and bring in little ; ye eat , but are not satisfied ; ye drink , but are not filled with drink ; ye clothe yourselves , but there is none warm ; and he that earneth wages earneth wages for a bag with holes .
DARBY	Haggai	1	7	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Consider your ways .
DARBY	Haggai	1	8	Go up to the mountain and bring wood , and build the house , and I will take pleasure in it , and I will be glorified , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Haggai	1	9	Ye looked for much , and behold it was little ; and when ye brought it home , I blew upon it . Wherefore ? saith Jehovah of hosts . Because of my house that lieth waste , whilst ye run every man to his own house .
DARBY	Haggai	1	10	Therefore over you the heavens withhold their dew , and the earth withholdeth its fruit .
DARBY	Haggai	1	11	And I called for a drought upon the land , and upon the mountains , and upon the corn , and upon the new wine , and upon the oil , and upon that which the ground bringeth forth , and upon man , and upon cattle , and upon all the labour of the hands .
DARBY	Haggai	1	12	And Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and all the remnant of the people , hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God , and the words of Haggai the prophet , according as Jehovah their God had sent him , and the people feared before Jehovah .
DARBY	Haggai	1	13	Then spoke Haggai , Jehovah 's messenger , in Jehovah 's message unto the people , saying , I am with you , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Haggai	1	14	And Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and the spirit of all the remnant of the people ; and they came and worked at the house of Jehovah of hosts , their God ,
DARBY	Haggai	1	15	in the four and twentieth day of the sixth month , in the second year of Darius the king .
DARBY	Haggai	2	2	Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest , and to the remnant of the people , saying ,
DARBY	Haggai	2	3	Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory ? and how do ye see it now ? Is it not as nothing in your eyes ?
DARBY	Haggai	2	4	But now be strong , Zerubbabel , saith Jehovah ; and be strong , Joshua son of Jehozadak , the high priest ; and be strong , all ye people of the land , saith Jehovah , and work : for I am with you , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Haggai	2	5	The word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt , and my Spirit , remain among you : fear ye not .
DARBY	Haggai	2	6	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Yet once , it is a little while , and I will shake the heavens , and the earth , and the sea , and the dry [ land ] ;
DARBY	Haggai	2	7	and I will shake all nations , and the desire of all nations shall come ; and I will fill this house with glory , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Haggai	2	8	The silver is mine , and the gold is mine , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Haggai	2	9	The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former , saith Jehovah of hosts ; and in this place will I give peace , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Haggai	2	10	On the four and twentieth [ day ] of the ninth [ month ] , in the second year of Darius , came the word of Jehovah by Haggai the prophet , saying ,
DARBY	Haggai	2	11	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Ask now the priests [ concerning ] the law , saying ,
DARBY	Haggai	2	12	If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment , and with his skirt do touch bread , or pottage , or wine , or oil , or any food—shall it become holy ? And the priests answered and said , No .
DARBY	Haggai	2	13	And Haggai said , If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these , is it become unclean ? And the priests answered and said , It shall be unclean .
DARBY	Haggai	2	14	Then answered Haggai and said , So is this people , and so is this nation before me , saith Jehovah , and so is every work of their hands ; and that which they offer there is unclean .
DARBY	Haggai	2	15	And now , I pray you , consider from this day and onward , from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of Jehovah ,
DARBY	Haggai	2	16	—before those [ days ] were , when one came to a heap of twenty [ measures ] , there were but ten ; when one came to the vat to draw out fifty press-measures , there were but twenty .
DARBY	Haggai	2	17	I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands ; and ye [ turned ] not to me , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Haggai	2	18	Consider , I pray you , from this day and onward , from the four and twentieth day of the ninth [ month ] , from the day that the foundation of Jehovah 's temple was laid , consider [ it ] .
DARBY	Haggai	2	19	Is the seed yet in the barn ? yea , the vine , and the fig-tree , and the pomegranate , and the olive-tree have not brought forth : from this day will I bless [ you ] .
DARBY	Haggai	2	20	And the word of Jehovah came the second time unto Haggai on the four and twentieth [ day ] of the month , saying ,
DARBY	Haggai	2	21	Speak to Zerubbabel , governor of Judah , saying , I will shake the heavens and the earth ;
DARBY	Haggai	2	22	and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms , and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations ; and I will overthrow the chariots , and those that ride therein ; and the horses and their riders shall come down , every one by the sword of his brother .
DARBY	Haggai	2	23	In that day , saith Jehovah of hosts , will I take thee , Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel , my servant , saith Jehovah , and will make thee as a signet ; for I have chosen thee , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Zechariah	1	1	In the eighth month , in the second year of Darius , came the word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the prophet , the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo , saying ,
DARBY	Zechariah	1	2	Jehovah hath been very wroth with your fathers .
DARBY	Zechariah	1	3	And thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Return unto me , saith Jehovah of hosts , and I will return unto you , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Zechariah	1	4	Be ye not as your fathers , unto whom the former prophets cried , saying , Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Turn ye now from your evil ways , and from your evil doings ; but they did not hearken nor attend unto me , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Zechariah	1	5	Your fathers , where are they ? and the prophets , do they live for ever ?
DARBY	Zechariah	1	6	But my words and my statutes , which I commanded my servants the prophets , did they not overtake your fathers ? And they turned and said , Like as Jehovah of hosts thought to do unto us , according to our ways and according to our doings , so hath he dealt with us .
DARBY	Zechariah	1	7	Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month , which is the month Shebat , in the second year of Darius , came the word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the prophet , the son of Berechiah , the son of Iddo , saying ,
DARBY	Zechariah	1	8	I saw by night , and behold , a man riding upon a red horse , and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the low valley ; and behind him were red , bay , and white horses .
DARBY	Zechariah	1	9	And I said , My lord , what are these ? And the angel that talked with me said unto me , I will shew thee what these are .
DARBY	Zechariah	1	10	And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said , These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth .
DARBY	Zechariah	1	11	And they answered the angel of Jehovah that stood among the myrtle-trees , and said , We have walked to and fro through the earth , and behold , all the earth sitteth still and is at rest .
DARBY	Zechariah	1	12	And the angel of Jehovah answered and said , Jehovah of hosts , how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah , against which thou hast had indignation these seventy years ?
DARBY	Zechariah	1	13	And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me good words , comforting words .
DARBY	Zechariah	1	14	And the angel that talked with me said unto me , Cry , saying , Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy ,
DARBY	Zechariah	1	15	and I am wroth exceedingly with the nations that are at ease ; for I was but a little wroth , and they helped forward the affliction .
DARBY	Zechariah	1	16	Therefore thus saith Jehovah : I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies : my house shall be built in it , saith Jehovah of hosts , and the line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem .
DARBY	Zechariah	1	17	Cry further , saying , Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity , and Jehovah shall yet comfort Zion , and shall yet choose Jerusalem .
DARBY	Zechariah	1	18	And I lifted up mine eyes , and saw , and behold four horns .
DARBY	Zechariah	1	19	And I said unto the angel that talked with me , What are these ? And he said to me , These are the horns which have scattered Judah , Israel , and Jerusalem .
DARBY	Zechariah	1	20	And Jehovah shewed me four craftsmen .
DARBY	Zechariah	1	21	And I said , What come these to do ? And he spoke , saying , Those are the horns which scattered Judah , so that no man lifted up his head ; but these are come to affright them , to cast out the horns of the nations , which lifted up the horn against the land of Judah to scatter it .
DARBY	Zechariah	2	2	And I said , Whither goest thou ? And he said unto me , To measure Jerusalem , to see what is the breadth thereof , and what is the length thereof .
DARBY	Zechariah	2	3	And behold , the angel that talked with me went forth ; and another angel went forth to meet him ,
DARBY	Zechariah	2	4	and said unto him , Run , speak to this young man , saying , Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein ;
DARBY	Zechariah	2	5	and I , saith Jehovah , I will be unto her a wall of fire round about , and will be the glory in the midst of her .
DARBY	Zechariah	2	6	Ho , ho ! flee from the land of the north , saith Jehovah ; for I have scattered you abroad as the four winds of the heavens , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Zechariah	2	7	Ho ! escape , Zion , that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon .
DARBY	Zechariah	2	8	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts : After the glory , hath he sent me unto the nations that made you a spoil ; for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye .
DARBY	Zechariah	2	9	For behold , I will shake my hand upon them , and they shall become a spoil to those that served them : and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me .
DARBY	Zechariah	2	10	Sing aloud and rejoice , daughter of Zion ; for behold , I come , and I will dwell in the midst of thee , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Zechariah	2	11	And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day , and shall be unto me for a people ; and I will dwell in the midst of thee , and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto thee .
DARBY	Zechariah	2	12	And Jehovah shall inherit Judah [ as ] his portion in the holy land , and shall yet choose Jerusalem .
DARBY	Zechariah	2	13	Let all flesh be silent before Jehovah ; for he is risen up out of his holy habitation .
DARBY	Zechariah	3	3	And Joshua was clothed with filthy garments , and stood before the Angel .
DARBY	Zechariah	3	2	And Jehovah said unto Satan , Jehovah rebuke thee , O Satan ! Yea , Jehovah that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee ! Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire ?
DARBY	Zechariah	3	4	And he spoke and said unto those that stood before him , saying , Take away the filthy garments from off him . And unto him he said , See , I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee , and I clothe thee with festival-robes .
DARBY	Zechariah	3	5	And I said , Let them set a pure turban upon his head . And they set the pure turban upon his head , and clothed him with garments ; and the Angel of Jehovah stood by .
DARBY	Zechariah	3	6	And the Angel of Jehovah protested unto Joshua , saying ,
DARBY	Zechariah	3	7	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : If thou wilt walk in my ways , and if thou wilt keep my charge , then thou shalt also judge my house , and shalt also keep my courts ; and I will give thee a place to walk among these that stand by .
DARBY	Zechariah	3	8	Hear now , Joshua the high priest , thou and thy fellows that sit before thee—for they are men of portent—for behold , I will bring forth my servant the Branch .
DARBY	Zechariah	3	9	For behold , the stone that I have laid before Joshua—upon one stone are seven eyes ; behold , I will engrave the graving thereof , saith Jehovah of hosts , and I will remove the iniquity of this land in one day .
DARBY	Zechariah	3	10	In that day , saith Jehovah of hosts , shall ye invite every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig-tree .
DARBY	Zechariah	4	4	And I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me , saying , What are these , my lord ?
DARBY	Zechariah	4	2	And he said unto me , What seest thou ? And I said , I see , and behold , a lamp-stand all of gold , with a bowl upon the top of it , and its seven lamps thereon , seven [ lamps ] and seven pipes to the lamps , which are upon the top thereof ;
DARBY	Zechariah	4	3	and two olive-trees beside it , one on the right of the bowl , and the other on the left of it .
DARBY	Zechariah	4	5	And the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me , Knowest thou not what these are ? And I said , No , my lord .
DARBY	Zechariah	4	6	And he answered and spoke unto me , saying , This is the word of Jehovah unto Zerubbabel , saying , Not by might , nor by power , but by my Spirit , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Zechariah	4	7	Who art thou , O great mountain ? before Zerubbabel [ thou dost become ] a plain ; and he shall bring forth the head-stone with shoutings : Grace , grace unto it !
DARBY	Zechariah	4	8	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Zechariah	4	9	The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house ; and his hands shall finish it : and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you .
DARBY	Zechariah	4	10	For who hath despised the day of small things ? Yea , they shall rejoice [ even ] those seven—and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel : these are the eyes of Jehovah , which run to and fro in the whole earth .
DARBY	Zechariah	4	11	And I answered and said unto him , What are these two olive-trees on the right of the lamp-stand and on its left ?
DARBY	Zechariah	4	12	And I answered the second time and said unto him , What are the two olive-branches which are beside the two golden tubes that empty the gold out of themselves ?
DARBY	Zechariah	4	13	And he spoke to me , saying , Knowest thou not what these are ? And I said , No , my lord .
DARBY	Zechariah	4	14	And he said , These are the two sons of oil , that stand before the Lord of the whole earth .
DARBY	Zechariah	5	5	And the angel that talked with me went forth , and said unto me , Lift up now thine eyes , and see what is this that goeth forth .
DARBY	Zechariah	5	2	And he said unto me , What seest thou ? And I said , I see a flying roll : the length thereof is twenty cubits , and the breadth thereof ten cubits .
DARBY	Zechariah	5	3	And he said unto me , This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole land : for every one that stealeth shall be cut off according to it on this side ; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off according to it on that side .
DARBY	Zechariah	5	4	I will cause it to go forth , saith Jehovah of hosts , and it shall enter into the house of the thief , and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name ; and it shall lodge in the midst of his house , and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof .
DARBY	Zechariah	5	6	And I said , What is it ? And he said , This is the ephah that goeth forth . And he said , This is their resemblance in all the land .
DARBY	Zechariah	5	7	And behold , there was lifted up a round plate of lead ; and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah .
DARBY	Zechariah	5	8	And he said , This is Wickedness : and he cast her into the midst of the ephah ; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof .
DARBY	Zechariah	5	9	And I lifted up mine eyes , and saw , and behold , there came out two women , and the wind was in their wings ; and they had wings like the wings of a stork ; and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens .
DARBY	Zechariah	5	10	And I said to the angel that talked with me , Whither do these carry the ephah ?
DARBY	Zechariah	5	11	And he said unto me , To build it a house in the land of Shinar ; and it shall be established , and set there upon its own base .
DARBY	Zechariah	6	6	That in which are the black horses goeth forth into the north country ; and the white go forth after them ; and the grisled go forth towards the south country ;
DARBY	Zechariah	6	2	In the first chariot were red horses ; and in the second chariot black horses ;
DARBY	Zechariah	6	3	and in the third chariot white horses ; and in the fourth chariot grisled , strong horses .
DARBY	Zechariah	6	4	And I spoke and said unto the angel that talked with me , What are these , my lord ?
DARBY	Zechariah	6	5	And the angel answered and said unto me , These are the four spirits of the heavens , which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth .
DARBY	Zechariah	6	7	and the strong go forth , and seek to go that they may walk to and fro through the earth . And he said , Go , walk to and fro through the earth . And they walked to and fro through the earth .
DARBY	Zechariah	6	8	And he cried unto me , and spoke unto me , saying , See , these that go forth towards the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country .
DARBY	Zechariah	6	9	And the word of Jehovah came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Zechariah	6	10	Take [ gifts ] of them of the captivity , of Heldai , of Tobijah , and of Jedaiah , and come thou the same day , and enter into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah , whither they are come from Babylon ;
DARBY	Zechariah	6	11	yea , take silver and gold , and make crowns , and set [ them ] upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest ;
DARBY	Zechariah	6	12	and speak unto him , saying , Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts , saying , Behold a man whose name is [ the ] Branch ; and he shall grow up from his own place , and he shall build the temple of Jehovah :
DARBY	Zechariah	6	13	even he shall build the temple of Jehovah ; and he shall bear the glory , and shall sit and rule upon his throne ; and he shall be a priest upon his throne ; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both .
DARBY	Zechariah	6	14	And the crowns shall be for Helem , and for Tobijah , and for Jedaiah , and for Hen the son of Zephaniah , for a memorial in the temple of Jehovah .
DARBY	Zechariah	6	15	And they that are far off shall come and build at the temple of Jehovah : and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you . And [ this ] shall come to pass , if ye will diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah your God .
DARBY	Zechariah	7	7	Are not these the words that Jehovah cried by the former prophets , when Jerusalem was inhabited and at peace , and her cities round about her , when the south and the lowland were inhabited ?
DARBY	Zechariah	7	2	when Bethel had sent Sherezer and Regem-melech , and his men , to supplicate Jehovah ,
DARBY	Zechariah	7	3	[ and ] to speak unto the priests that were in the house of Jehovah of hosts , and to the prophets , saying , Should I weep in the fifth month , separating myself , as I have done now so many years ?
DARBY	Zechariah	7	4	And the word of Jehovah of hosts came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Zechariah	7	5	Speak unto all the people of the land , and to the priests , saying , When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh [ month ] , even those seventy years , did ye really fast unto me , [ even ] unto me ?
DARBY	Zechariah	7	6	And when ye ate , and when ye drank , was it not you that were eating and drinking ?
DARBY	Zechariah	7	8	And the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah , saying ,
DARBY	Zechariah	7	9	Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts , saying , Execute true judgment , and shew loving-kindness and mercies one to another ,
DARBY	Zechariah	7	10	and oppress not the widow and the fatherless , the stranger and the afflicted ; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart .
DARBY	Zechariah	7	11	But they refused to hearken , and turned a rebellious shoulder , and made their ears heavy , that they should not hear .
DARBY	Zechariah	7	12	And they made their heart [ as ] an adamant , that they should not hear the law , and the words that Jehovah of hosts sent by his Spirit by the hand of the former prophets : therefore was there great wrath from Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Zechariah	7	13	And it came to pass , like as he called , and they would not hear , so they called , and I would not hear , saith Jehovah of hosts ;
DARBY	Zechariah	7	14	and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not , and the land was desolate after them , so that no one passed through nor returned ; and they laid the pleasant land desolate .
DARBY	Zechariah	8	8	and I will bring them , and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem ; and they shall be my people , and I will be their God , in truth and in righteousness .
DARBY	Zechariah	8	2	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy , and I am jealous for her with great fury .
DARBY	Zechariah	8	3	Thus saith Jehovah : I am returned unto Zion , and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem ; and Jerusalem shall be called , The city of truth ; and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts , The holy mountain .
DARBY	Zechariah	8	4	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : There shall yet old men and old women sit in the streets of Jerusalem , each one with his staff in his hand for multitude of days .
DARBY	Zechariah	8	5	And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof .
DARBY	Zechariah	8	6	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : If it be wonderful in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days , should it also be wonderful in mine eyes ? saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Zechariah	8	7	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Behold , I will save my people from the east country and from the west country ;
DARBY	Zechariah	8	9	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Let your hands be strong , ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets , that were in the day that the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts was laid , that the temple might be built .
DARBY	Zechariah	8	10	For before those days there was no hire for man , nor any hire for beast ; and there was no peace for him that went out or that came in , because of the distress : for I let loose all men , every one against his neighbour .
DARBY	Zechariah	8	11	But now I will not be unto the remnant of this people as in the former days , saith Jehovah of hosts ;
DARBY	Zechariah	8	12	for the seed shall be prosperous , the vine shall give its fruit , and the ground shall give its produce , and the heavens shall give their dew ; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these [ things ] .
DARBY	Zechariah	8	13	And it shall come to pass , like as ye were a curse among the nations , O house of Judah and house of Israel , so will I save you , and ye shall be a blessing : fear ye not , let your hands be strong .
DARBY	Zechariah	8	14	For thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Like as I thought to do you evil when your fathers provoked me to wrath , saith Jehovah of hosts , and I repented not ;
DARBY	Zechariah	8	15	so again have I thought in these days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah : fear ye not .
DARBY	Zechariah	8	16	These are the things that ye shall do : Speak truth every one with his neighbour ; execute truth and the judgment of peace in your gates ;
DARBY	Zechariah	8	17	and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour ; and love no false oath : for all these are [ things ] that I hate , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Zechariah	8	18	And the word of Jehovah of hosts came unto me , saying ,
DARBY	Zechariah	8	19	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : The fast of the fourth [ month ] and the fast of the fifth , and the fast of the seventh , and the fast of the tenth , shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness , and cheerful gatherings . Love ye then truth and peace .
DARBY	Zechariah	8	20	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : Yet again shall there come peoples , and the inhabitants of many cities ;
DARBY	Zechariah	8	21	and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another , saying , Let us go speedily to supplicate Jehovah , and to seek Jehovah of hosts : I will go also .
DARBY	Zechariah	8	22	And many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem , and to supplicate Jehovah .
DARBY	Zechariah	8	23	Thus saith Jehovah of hosts : In those days shall ten men take hold , out of all languages of the nations , shall even take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew , saying , We will go with you ; for we have heard [ that ] God is with you .
DARBY	Zechariah	9	9	Rejoice greatly , daughter of Zion ; shout , daughter of Jerusalem ! Behold , thy King cometh to thee : he is just , and having salvation ; lowly and rIding upon an ass , even upon a colt the foal of an ass .
DARBY	Zechariah	9	2	and also [ on ] Hamath [ which ] bordereth thereon ; on Tyre and Zidon , though she be very wise .
DARBY	Zechariah	9	3	And Tyre hath built herself a stronghold , and hath heaped up silver as the dust , and fine gold as the mire of the streets .
DARBY	Zechariah	9	4	Behold , the Lord will take possession of her , and he will smite her power in the sea ; and she shall be devoured with fire .
DARBY	Zechariah	9	5	Ashkelon shall see [ it ] , and fear ; Gazah also , and she shall be greatly pained ; Ekron also , for her expectation shall be put to shame : and the king shall perish from Gazah , and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited .
DARBY	Zechariah	9	6	And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod , and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines ;
DARBY	Zechariah	9	7	and I will take away his blood out of his mouth , and his abominations from between his teeth ; but he that remaineth , he also shall belong to our God , and shall be as a leader in Judah , and Ekron as a Jebusite .
DARBY	Zechariah	9	8	And I will encamp about my house because of the army , because of those that pass by and that return ; and the exactor shall not pass through them any more : for now have I seen [ it ] with mine eyes .
DARBY	Zechariah	9	10	And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim , and the horse from Jerusalem ; and the battle-bow shall be cut off . And he shall speak peace unto the nations ; and his dominion shall be from sea to sea , and from the river to the ends of the earth .
DARBY	Zechariah	9	11	As for thee also , by the blood of thy covenant , I will send forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water .
DARBY	Zechariah	9	12	Turn again to the stronghold , prisoners of hope ! even to-day do I declare I will render double unto thee .
DARBY	Zechariah	9	13	For I have bent Judah for me , I have filled the bow with Ephraim ; and I will raise up thy sons , O Zion , against thy sons , O Greece , and make thee like the sword of a mighty man .
DARBY	Zechariah	9	14	And Jehovah shall be seen over them , and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning ; and the Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet , and will march with whirlwinds of the south .
DARBY	Zechariah	9	15	Jehovah of hosts will defend them ; and they shall devour , and shall tread down the sling-stones ; and they shall drink , [ and ] make a noise as from wine ; and they shall be filled like a bowl , like the corners of the altar .
DARBY	Zechariah	9	16	And Jehovah their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people ; for [ they shall be as ] the stones of a crown , lifted up upon his land .
DARBY	Zechariah	9	17	For how great is his goodness , and how great is his beauty ! Corn shall make the young men flourish , and new wine the maidens .
DARBY	Zechariah	10	10	And I will bring them again out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of Assyria ; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon ; and [ place ] shall not be found for them .
DARBY	Zechariah	10	2	For the teraphim have spoken vanity , and the diviners have seen a lie , and have told false dreams : they comfort in vain . Therefore they have gone away as a flock , they are in distress , because there is no shepherd .
DARBY	Zechariah	10	3	Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds , and I will punish the he-goats ; for Jehovah of hosts visiteth his flock , the house of Judah , and maketh them as his majestic horse in the battle .
DARBY	Zechariah	10	4	From him shall come forth the corner-stone , from him the nail , from him the battle bow , from him every exactor together .
DARBY	Zechariah	10	5	And they shall be as mighty men , treading down the mire of the streets in the battle ; and they shall fight , for Jehovah is with them , and the riders on horses shall be put to shame .
DARBY	Zechariah	10	6	And I will strengthen the house of Judah , and I will save the house of Joseph , and I will bring them back again ; for I will have mercy upon them ; and they shall be as though I had not cast them off : for I am Jehovah their God , and I will answer them .
DARBY	Zechariah	10	7	And [ they of ] Ephraim shall be like a mighty man , and their hearts shall rejoice as through wine ; and their children shall see [ it ] , and rejoice ; their heart shall be joyful in Jehovah .
DARBY	Zechariah	10	8	I will hiss for them , and gather them ; for I have redeemed them : and they shall multiply as they used to multiply .
DARBY	Zechariah	10	9	And I will sow them among the peoples , and they shall remember me in far countries ; and they shall live with their children and return .
DARBY	Zechariah	10	11	And he shall pass through the sea of affliction , and shall smite the billows in the sea , and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up ; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down , and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away .
DARBY	Zechariah	10	12	And I will strengthen them in Jehovah ; and they shall walk in his name , saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Zechariah	11	11	And it was broken in that day ; and so the poor of the flock that gave heed to me knew that it was the word of Jehovah .
DARBY	Zechariah	11	2	Howl , cypress , for the cedar is fallen ; because the noble ones are spoiled . Howl , ye oaks of Bashan ; for the strong forest is come down .
DARBY	Zechariah	11	3	A voice of howling of the shepherds ; for their glory is spoiled : a voice of roaring of young lions ; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled .
DARBY	Zechariah	11	4	Thus saith Jehovah my God : Feed the flock of slaughter ,
DARBY	Zechariah	11	5	whose possessors slay them without being held guilty ; and they that sell them say , Blessed be Jehovah ! for I am become rich ; and their own shepherds pity them not .
DARBY	Zechariah	11	6	For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land , saith Jehovah , and behold , I will deliver men , every one into his neighbour 's hand , and into the hand of his king ; and they shall smite the land , and I will not deliver out of their hand .
DARBY	Zechariah	11	7	So I fed the flock of slaughter , truly the poor of the flock . And I took unto me two staves ; the one I called Beauty , and the other I called Bands ; and I fed the flock .
DARBY	Zechariah	11	8	And I destroyed three shepherds in one month ; and my soul was vexed with them , and their soul also loathed me .
DARBY	Zechariah	11	9	And I said , I will not feed you : that which dieth , let it die ; and that which perisheth let it perish ; and let them which are left eat every one the flesh of another .
DARBY	Zechariah	11	10	And I took my staff , Beauty , and cut it asunder , that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples .
DARBY	Zechariah	11	12	And I said unto them , If ye think good , give [ me ] my hire ; and if not , forbear . And they weighed for my hire thirty silver-pieces .
DARBY	Zechariah	11	13	And Jehovah said unto me , Cast it unto the potter : a goodly price that I was prized at by them . And I took the thirty silver-pieces , and cast them to the potter in the house of Jehovah .
DARBY	Zechariah	11	14	And I cut asunder mine other staff , Bands , to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel .
DARBY	Zechariah	11	15	And Jehovah said unto me , Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd .
DARBY	Zechariah	11	16	For behold , I will raise up a shepherd in the land , who shall not visit those that are about to perish , neither shall seek that which is strayed away , nor heal that which is wounded , nor feed that which is sound ; but he will eat the flesh of the fat , and tear their hoofs in pieces .
DARBY	Zechariah	11	17	Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaveth the flock ! The sword shall be upon his arm , and upon his right eye ; his arm shall be clean dried up , and his right eye utterly darkened .
DARBY	Zechariah	12	12	And the land shall mourn , every family apart : the family of the house of David apart , and their wives apart ; the family of the house of Nathan apart , and their wives apart ;
DARBY	Zechariah	12	2	Behold , I will make Jerusalem a cup of bewilderment unto all the peoples round about , and also against Judah shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem .
DARBY	Zechariah	12	3	And it shall come to pass in that day [ that ] I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone unto all peoples : all that burden themselves with it shall certainly be wounded , and all the nations of the earth shall be assembled together against it .
DARBY	Zechariah	12	4	In that day , saith Jehovah , I will smite every horse with astonishment , and his rider with madness ; but I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah , and will smite every horse of the peoples with blindness .
DARBY	Zechariah	12	5	And the leaders of Judah shall say in their heart , The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength through Jehovah of hosts their God .
DARBY	Zechariah	12	6	In that day will I make the leaders of Judah like a hearth of fire among wood , and like a torch of fire in a sheaf ; and they shall devour all the peoples round about , on the right hand and on the left ; and Jerusalem shall dwell again in her own place , in Jerusalem .
DARBY	Zechariah	12	7	And Jehovah shall save the tents of Judah first , that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem be not magnified over Judah .
DARBY	Zechariah	12	8	In that day will Jehovah defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; and he that stumbleth among them at that day shall be as David ; and the house of David as God , as the Angel of Jehovah before them .
DARBY	Zechariah	12	9	And it shall come to pass in that day , [ that ] I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem .
DARBY	Zechariah	12	10	And I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications ; and they shall look on me whom they pierced , and they shall mourn for him , as one mourneth for an only [ son ] , and shall be in bitterness for him , as one that is in bitterness for [ his ] firstborn .
DARBY	Zechariah	12	11	In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem , as the mourning of Hadad-rimmon in the valley of Megiddon .
DARBY	Zechariah	12	13	the family of the house of Levi apart , and their wives apart ; the family of Shimei apart , and their wives apart ;
DARBY	Zechariah	12	14	all the families that remain , every family apart , and their wives apart .
DARBY	Zechariah	13	13	In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness .
DARBY	Zechariah	13	2	And it shall come to pass in that day , saith Jehovah of hosts , [ that ] I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land , and they shall no more be remembered ; and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land .
DARBY	Zechariah	13	3	And it shall come to pass , if any shall yet prophesy , that his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him , Thou shalt not live ; for thou speakest lies in the name of Jehovah ; and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth .
DARBY	Zechariah	13	4	And it shall come to pass in that day , [ that ] the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision , when he prophesieth ; neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive .
DARBY	Zechariah	13	5	And he shall say , I am no prophet , I am a tiller of the ground ; for man acquired me [ as bondman ] from my youth .
DARBY	Zechariah	13	6	And one shall say unto him , What are those wounds in thy hands ? And he will say , Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends .
DARBY	Zechariah	13	7	Awake , O sword , against my shepherd , even against the man [ that is ] my fellow , saith Jehovah of hosts : smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered , and I will turn my hand upon the little ones .
DARBY	Zechariah	13	8	And it shall come to pass in all the land , saith Jehovah , two parts therein shall be cut off [ and ] die ; but the third shall be left therein .
DARBY	Zechariah	13	9	And I will bring the third part into the fire , and will refine them as silver is refined , and will try them as gold is tried . They shall call on my name , and I will answer them : I will say , It is my people ; and they shall say , Jehovah is my God .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	14	And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem ; and the wealth of all the nations round about shall be gathered together—gold , and silver , and garments , in great abundance .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	2	And I will assemble all the nations against Jerusalem to battle ; and the city shall be taken , and the houses rifled , and the women ravished ; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity ; and the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	3	And Jehovah will go forth and fight with those nations , as when he fought in the day of battle .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	4	And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives , which is before Jerusalem toward the east , and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west , —a very great valley ; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north , and half of it toward the south .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	5	And ye shall flee [ by ] the valley of my mountains ; for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal : ye shall even flee , like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah . And Jehovah my God shall come , [ and ] all the holy ones with thee .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	6	And it shall come to pass in that day , [ that ] there shall not be light ; the shining shall be obscured .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	7	And it shall be one day which is known to Jehovah , not day , and not night ; and it shall come to pass , at eventide it shall be light .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	8	And it shall come to pass in that day [ that ] living waters shall go out from Jerusalem ; half of them toward the eastern sea , and half of them toward the hinder sea : in summer and in winter shall it be .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	9	And Jehovah shall be king over all the earth : in that day shall there be one Jehovah , and his name one .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	10	All the land from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem shall be turned as the Arabah ; and [ Jerusalem ] shall be lifted up , and shall dwell in her own place , from Benjamin 's gate unto the place of the first gate , unto the corner-gate , and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king 's winepresses .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	11	And [ men ] shall dwell in it , and there shall be no more utter destruction ; and Jerusalem shall dwell safely .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	12	And this shall be the plague wherewith Jehovah will smite all the peoples that have warred against Jerusalem : their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet , and their eyes shall consume away in their holes , and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	13	And it shall come to pass in that day [ that ] a great panic from Jehovah shall be among them ; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour , and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	15	And so shall be the plague of the horse , of the mule , of the camel , and of the ass , and of all the beasts that shall be in those camps , as this plague .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	16	And it shall come to pass , that all that are left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year to year to worship the King , Jehovah of hosts , and to celebrate the feast of tabernacles .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	17	And it shall be , that whoso goeth not up of the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King , Jehovah of hosts , upon them shall be no rain .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	18	And if the family of Egypt go not up , and come not , neither [ shall it be ] upon them ; [ there ] shall be the plague , wherewith Jehovah will smite the nations that go not up to celebrate the feast of tabernacles .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	19	This shall be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all the nations that go not up to celebrate the feast of tabernacles .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	20	In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses , HOLINESS UNTO JEHOVAH ; and the pots in Jehovah 's house shall be like the bowls before the altar .
DARBY	Zechariah	14	21	And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto Jehovah of hosts ; and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them , and seethe therein . And in that day there shall be no more a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Malachi	1	1	The burden of the word of Jehovah to Israel by Malachi .
DARBY	Malachi	1	2	I have loved you , saith Jehovah ; but ye say , Wherein hast thou loved us ? Was not Esau Jacob 's brother ? saith Jehovah , and I loved Jacob ,
DARBY	Malachi	1	3	and I hated Esau ; and made his mountains a desolation , and [ gave ] his inheritance to the jackals of the wilderness .
DARBY	Malachi	1	4	If Edom say , We are broken down , but we will build again the ruined places , —thus saith Jehovah of hosts : They shall build , but I will throw down ; and [ men ] shall call them the territory of wickedness , and the people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever .
DARBY	Malachi	1	5	And your eyes shall see [ it ] , and ye shall say , Jehovah is magnified beyond the border of Israel .
DARBY	Malachi	1	6	A son honoureth [ his ] father , and a servant his master : if then I be a father , where is mine honour ? and if I be a master , where is my fear ? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you , priests , that despise my name . But ye say , Wherein have we despised thy name ?
DARBY	Malachi	1	7	Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar ; and ye say , Wherein have we polluted thee ? In that ye say , The table of Jehovah is contemptible .
DARBY	Malachi	1	8	And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice , is it not evil ? And if ye offer the lame and sick , is it not evil ? Present it now unto thy governor : will he be pleased with thee ? or will he accept thy person ? saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Malachi	1	9	And now , I pray you , beseech God that he will be gracious unto us . This hath been of your hand : will he accept any of your persons ? saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Malachi	1	10	Who is there among you that would even shut the doors ? and ye would not kindle [ fire ] on mine altar for nothing . I have no delight in you , saith Jehovah of hosts , neither will I accept an oblation at your hand .
DARBY	Malachi	1	11	For from the rising of the sun even unto its setting my name shall be great among the nations ; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name , and a pure oblation : for my name shall be great among the nations , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Malachi	1	12	But ye profane it , in that ye say , The table of the Lord is polluted ; and the fruit thereof , his food , is contemptible .
DARBY	Malachi	1	13	And ye say , Behold , what a weariness ! And ye have puffed at it , saith Jehovah of hosts , and ye bring [ that which was ] torn , and the lame , and the sick ; thus ye bring the oblation : should I accept this of your hand ? saith Jehovah .
DARBY	Malachi	1	14	Yea , cursed be the deceiver , who hath in his flock a male , and voweth and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing ; for I am a great King , saith Jehovah of hosts , and my name is terrible among the nations .
DARBY	Malachi	2	2	If ye do not hear , and if ye do not lay [ it ] to heart , to give glory unto my name , saith Jehovah of hosts , I will even send the curse among you , and I will curse your blessings : yea , I have already cursed them , because ye do not lay [ it ] to heart .
DARBY	Malachi	2	3	Behold , I will rebuke your seed , and spread dung upon your faces , the dung of your feasts ; and they shall take you away with it .
DARBY	Malachi	2	4	And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you , that my covenant might be with Levi , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Malachi	2	5	My covenant with him was of life and peace , and I gave them to him that he might fear ; and he feared me , and trembled before my name .
DARBY	Malachi	2	6	The law of truth was in his mouth , and unrighteousness was not found in his lips : he walked with me in peace and uprightness , and he turned many from iniquity .
DARBY	Malachi	2	7	For the priest 's lips should keep knowledge , and at his mouth they seek the law ; for he is the messenger of Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Malachi	2	8	But ye are departed out of the way ; ye have caused many to stumble at the law ; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Malachi	2	9	And I also have made you contemptible and base before all the people , because ye have not kept my ways , but have respect of persons in [ administering ] the law .
DARBY	Malachi	2	10	Have we not all one father ? Hath not one God created us ? Why do we deal unfaithfully every man against his brother , by profaning the covenant of our fathers ?
DARBY	Malachi	2	11	Judah hath dealt unfaithfully , and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem ; for Judah hath profaned the sanctuary of Jehovah which he loved , and hath married the daughter of a strange god .
DARBY	Malachi	2	12	Jehovah will cut off from the tents of Jacob the man that doeth this , him that calleth and him that answereth ; and him that offereth an oblation unto Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Malachi	2	13	And further ye do this : ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears , with weeping , and with sighing , insomuch that he regardeth not the oblation any more , nor receiveth [ it ] with satisfaction at your hand .
DARBY	Malachi	2	14	Yet ye say , Wherefore ? Because Jehovah hath been a witness between thee and the wife of thy youth , against whom thou hast dealt unfaithfully : yet is she thy companion , and the wife of thy covenant .
DARBY	Malachi	2	15	And did not one make [ them ] ? and the remnant of the Spirit was his . And wherefore the one ? He sought a seed of God . Take heed then to your spirit , and let none deal unfaithfully against the wife of his youth ,
DARBY	Malachi	2	16	( for I hate putting away , saith Jehovah the God of Israel ; ) and he covereth with violence his garment , saith Jehovah of hosts : take heed then to your spirit , that ye deal not unfaithfully .
DARBY	Malachi	2	17	Ye have wearied Jehovah with your words , and ye say , Wherein have we wearied [ him ] ? In that ye say , Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of Jehovah , and he delighteth in them ; or , Where is the God of judgment ?
DARBY	Malachi	3	3	And he shall sit [ as ] a refiner and purifier of silver ; and he will purify the children of Levi , and purge them as gold and silver ; and they shall offer unto Jehovah an oblation in righteousness .
DARBY	Malachi	3	2	But who shall endure the day of his coming ? and who shall stand when he appeareth ? For he will be like a refiner 's fire , and like fullers ' lye .
DARBY	Malachi	3	4	Then shall the oblation of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah , as in the days of old , and as in former years .
DARBY	Malachi	3	5	And I will come near to you to judgment ; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers , and against the adulterers , and against the false swearers , and against those that oppress the hired servant in [ his ] wages , the widow and the fatherless , and that turn aside the stranger [ from his right ] , and fear not me , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Malachi	3	6	For I Jehovah change not , and ye , sons of Jacob , are not consumed .
DARBY	Malachi	3	7	Since the days of your fathers have ye departed from my statutes , and have not kept them . Return unto me , and I will return unto you , saith Jehovah of hosts . But ye say , Wherein shall we return ?
DARBY	Malachi	3	8	Will a man rob God ? But ye rob me . And ye say , Wherein do we rob thee ? [ In ] tithes and heave-offerings .
DARBY	Malachi	3	9	Ye are cursed with a curse ; and me ye rob , [ even ] this whole nation .
DARBY	Malachi	3	10	Bring the whole tithe into the treasure-house , that there may be food in my house , and prove me now herewith , saith Jehovah of hosts , if I open not to you the windows of the heavens , and pour you out a blessing , till there be no place for it .
DARBY	Malachi	3	11	And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes , and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground ; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Malachi	3	12	And all nations shall call you blessed ; for ye shall be a delightsome land , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Malachi	3	13	Your words have been stout against me , saith Jehovah ; but ye say , What have we been speaking against thee ?
DARBY	Malachi	3	14	Ye say , It is vain to serve God ; and what profit is it that we keep his charge , and that we walk mournfully before Jehovah of hosts ?
DARBY	Malachi	3	15	And now we hold the proud for happy ; yea , they that work wickedness are built up ; yea , they tempt God , and they escape .
DARBY	Malachi	3	16	Then they that feared Jehovah spoke often one to another ; and Jehovah observed [ it ] , and heard , and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared Jehovah , and that thought upon his name .
DARBY	Malachi	3	17	And they shall be unto me a peculiar treasure , saith Jehovah of hosts , in the day that I prepare ; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him .
DARBY	Malachi	3	18	And ye shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked , between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not .
DARBY	Malachi	4	4	Remember the law of Moses my servant , which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel , the statutes and ordinances .
DARBY	Malachi	4	2	And unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings ; and ye shall go forth and leap like fatted calves .
DARBY	Malachi	4	3	And ye shall tread down the wicked ; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I prepare , saith Jehovah of hosts .
DARBY	Malachi	4	5	Behold , I send unto you Elijah the prophet , before the coming of the great and terrible day of Jehovah .
DARBY	Malachi	4	6	And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children , and the heart of the children to their fathers , lest I come and smite the earth with a curse .
