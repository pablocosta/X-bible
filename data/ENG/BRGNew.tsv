BRG	Matthew	1	1	The book of the generation of Jesus Christ , the son of David , the son of Abraham .
BRG	Matthew	1	2	Abraham begat Isaac ; and Isaac begat Jacob ; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren ;
BRG	Matthew	1	3	And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar ; and Phares begat Esrom ; and Esrom begat Aram ;
BRG	Matthew	1	4	And Aram begat Aminadab ; and Aminadab begat Naasson ; and Naasson begat Salmon ;
BRG	Matthew	1	5	And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab ; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth ; and Obed begat Jesse ;
BRG	Matthew	1	6	And Jesse begat David the king ; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias ;
BRG	Matthew	1	7	And Solomon begat Roboam ; and Roboam begat Abia ; and Abia begat Asa ;
BRG	Matthew	1	8	And Asa begat Josaphat ; and Josaphat begat Joram ; and Joram begat Ozias ;
BRG	Matthew	1	9	And Ozias begat Joatham ; and Joatham begat Achaz ; and Achaz begat Ezekias ;
BRG	Matthew	1	10	And Ezekias begat Manasses ; and Manasses begat Amon ; and Amon begat Josias ;
BRG	Matthew	1	11	And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren , about the time they were carried away to Babylon :
BRG	Matthew	1	12	And after they were brought to Babylon , Jechonias begat Salathiel ; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel ;
BRG	Matthew	1	13	And Zorobabel begat Abiud ; and Abiud begat Eliakim ; and Eliakim begat Azor ;
BRG	Matthew	1	14	And Azor begat Sadoc ; and Sadoc begat Achim ; and Achim begat Eliud ;
BRG	Matthew	1	15	And Eliud begat Eleazar ; and Eleazar begat Matthan ; and Matthan begat Jacob ;
BRG	Matthew	1	16	And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
BRG	Matthew	1	17	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations .
BRG	Matthew	1	18	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise : When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph , before they came together , she was found with child of the Holy Ghost .
BRG	Matthew	1	19	Then Joseph her husband , being a just man , and not willing to make her a publick example , was minded to put her away privily .
BRG	Matthew	1	20	But while he thought on these things , behold , the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream , saying , Joseph , thou son of David , fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife : for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost .
BRG	Matthew	1	21	And she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name Jesus : for he shall save his people from their sins .
BRG	Matthew	1	22	Now all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying ,
BRG	Matthew	1	23	Behold , a virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , and they shall call his name Emmanuel , which being interpreted is , God with us . ( A )
BRG	Matthew	1	24	Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him , and took unto him his wife :
BRG	Matthew	1	25	And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son : and he called his name Jesus . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Matthew	1	4145648	""
BRG	Matthew	2	2	Saying , Where is he that is born King of the Jews ? for we have seen his star in the east , and are come to worship him .
BRG	Matthew	2	3	When Herod the king had heard these things , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
BRG	Matthew	2	4	And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together , he demanded of them where Christ should be born .
BRG	Matthew	2	5	And they said unto him , In Bethlehem of Judaea : for thus it is written by the prophet ,
BRG	Matthew	2	6	And thou Bethlehem , in the land of Juda , art not the least among the princes of Juda : for out of thee shall come a Governor , that shall rule my people Israel . ( A )
BRG	Matthew	2	7	Then Herod , when he had privily called the wise men , enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared .
BRG	Matthew	2	8	And he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , Go and search diligently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also .
BRG	Matthew	2	9	When they had heard the king , they departed ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was .
BRG	Matthew	2	10	When they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
BRG	Matthew	2	11	And when they were come into the house , they saw the young child with Mary his mother , and fell down , and worshipped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented unto him gifts ; gold , and frankincense , and myrrh .
BRG	Matthew	2	12	And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod , they departed into their own country another way .
BRG	Matthew	2	13	And when they were departed , behold , the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream , saying , Arise , and take the young child and his mother , and flee into Egypt , and be thou there until I bring thee word : for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him .
BRG	Matthew	2	14	When he arose , he took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt :
BRG	Matthew	2	15	And was there until the death of Herod : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying , Out of Egypt have I called my son . ( B )
BRG	Matthew	2	16	Then Herod , when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men , was exceeding wroth , and sent forth , and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem , and in all the coasts thereof , from two years old and under , according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men .
BRG	Matthew	2	17	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet , saying ,
BRG	Matthew	2	18	In Rama was there a voice heard , lamentation , and weeping , and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children , and would not be comforted , because they are not . ( C )
BRG	Matthew	2	19	But when Herod was dead , behold , an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt ,
BRG	Matthew	2	20	Saying , Arise , and take the young child and his mother , and go into the land of Israel : for they are dead which sought the young child ’ s life .
BRG	Matthew	2	21	And he arose , and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
BRG	Matthew	2	22	But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod , he was afraid to go thither : notwithstanding , being warned of God in a dream , he turned aside into the parts of Galilee :
BRG	Matthew	2	23	And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets , He shall be called a Nazarene . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Matthew	3	3	For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias , saying , The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight . ( A )
BRG	Matthew	3	2	And saying , Repent ye : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
BRG	Matthew	3	4	And the same John had his raiment of camel ’ s hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins ; and his meat was locusts and wild honey .
BRG	Matthew	3	5	Then went out to him Jerusalem , and all Judaea , and all the region round about Jordan ,
BRG	Matthew	3	6	And were baptized of him in Jordan , confessing their sins .
BRG	Matthew	3	7	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism , he said unto them , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
BRG	Matthew	3	8	Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance :
BRG	Matthew	3	9	And think not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
BRG	Matthew	3	10	And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
BRG	Matthew	3	11	I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance : but he that cometh after me is mightier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to bear : he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost , and with fire :
BRG	Matthew	3	12	Whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and gather his wheat into the garner ; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire .
BRG	Matthew	3	13	Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John , to be baptized of him .
BRG	Matthew	3	14	But John forbad him , saying , I have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me ?
BRG	Matthew	3	15	And Jesus answering said unto him , Suffer it to be so now : for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . Then he suffered him .
BRG	Matthew	3	16	And Jesus , when he was baptized , went up straightway out of the water : and , lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove , and lighting upon him :
BRG	Matthew	3	17	And lo a voice from heaven , saying , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . ( B ) Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Matthew	4	4	But he answered and said , It is written , Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God .
BRG	Matthew	4	2	And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights , he was afterward an hungred .
BRG	Matthew	4	3	And when the tempter came to him , he said , If thou be the Son of God , command that these stones be made bread .
BRG	Matthew	4	5	Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city , and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple ,
BRG	Matthew	4	6	And saith unto him , If thou be the Son of God , cast thyself down : for it is written , He shall give his angels charge concerning thee : and in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone .
BRG	Matthew	4	7	Jesus said unto him , It is written again , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
BRG	Matthew	4	8	Again , the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain , and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of them ;
BRG	Matthew	4	9	And saith unto him , All these things will I give thee , if thou wilt fall down and worship me .
BRG	Matthew	4	10	Then saith Jesus unto him , Get thee hence , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
BRG	Matthew	4	11	Then the devil leaveth him , and , behold , angels came and ministered unto him .
BRG	Matthew	4	12	Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison , he departed into Galilee ;
BRG	Matthew	4	13	And leaving Nazareth , he came and dwelt in Capernaum , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim :
BRG	Matthew	4	14	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet , saying ,
BRG	Matthew	4	15	The land of Zabulon , and the land of Nephthalim , by the way of the sea , beyond Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles ;
BRG	Matthew	4	16	The people which sat in darkness saw great light ; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up .
BRG	Matthew	4	17	From that time Jesus began to preach , and to say , Repent : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
BRG	Matthew	4	18	And Jesus , walking by the sea of Galilee , saw two brethren , Simon called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
BRG	Matthew	4	19	And he saith unto them , Follow me , and I will make you fishers of men .
BRG	Matthew	4	20	And they straightway left their nets , and followed him .
BRG	Matthew	4	21	And going on from thence , he saw other two brethren , James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , in a ship with Zebedee their father , mending their nets ; and he called them .
BRG	Matthew	4	22	And they immediately left the ship and their father , and followed him .
BRG	Matthew	4	23	And Jesus went about all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people .
BRG	Matthew	4	24	And his fame went throughout all Syria : and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments , and those which were possessed with devils , and those which were lunatick , and those that had the palsy ; and he healed them .

BRG	Matthew	5	5	Blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth .
BRG	Matthew	5	2	And he opened his mouth , and taught them , saying ,
BRG	Matthew	5	3	Blessed are the poor in spirit : for their ’ s is the kingdom of heaven .
BRG	Matthew	5	4	Blessed are they that mourn : for they shall be comforted .
BRG	Matthew	5	6	Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled .
BRG	Matthew	5	7	Blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy .

BRG	Matthew	5	10	Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness ’ sake : for their ’ s is the kingdom of heaven .
BRG	Matthew	5	11	Blessed are ye , when men shall revile you , and persecute you , and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my sake .
BRG	Matthew	5	12	Rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you .
BRG	Matthew	5	13	Ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be salted ? it is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be trodden under foot of men .
BRG	Matthew	5	14	Ye are the light of the world . A city that is set on an hill can not be hid .
BRG	Matthew	5	15	Neither do men light a candle , and put it under a bushel , but on a candlestick ; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house .
BRG	Matthew	5	16	Let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father which is in heaven .
BRG	Matthew	5	17	Think not that I am come to destroy the law , or the prophets : I am not come to destroy , but to fulfil .
BRG	Matthew	5	18	For verily I say unto you , Till heaven and earth pass , one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law , till all be fulfilled .
BRG	Matthew	5	19	Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments , and shall teach men so , he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven : but whosoever shall do and teach them , the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
BRG	Matthew	5	20	For I say unto you , That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven .
BRG	Matthew	5	21	Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time , Thou shalt not kill ; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment :
BRG	Matthew	5	22	But I say unto you , That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment : and whosoever shall say to his brother , Raca , shall be in danger of the council : but whosoever shall say , Thou fool , shall be in danger of hell fire .
BRG	Matthew	5	23	Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar , and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee ;
BRG	Matthew	5	24	Leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way ; first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift .
BRG	Matthew	5	25	Agree with thine adversary quickly , whiles thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .

BRG	Matthew	5	33	Again , ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time , Thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths :
BRG	Matthew	5	34	But I say unto you , Swear not at all ; neither by heaven ; for it is God ’ s throne :
BRG	Matthew	5	35	Nor by the earth ; for it is his footstool : neither by Jerusalem ; for it is the city of the great King .
BRG	Matthew	5	36	Neither shalt thou swear by thy head , because thou canst not make one hair white or black .

BRG	Matthew	8	8	The centurion answered and said , Lord , I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof : but speak the word only , and my servant shall be healed .
BRG	Matthew	8	2	And , behold , there came a leper and worshipped him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
BRG	Matthew	8	3	And Jesus put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will ; be thou clean . And immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
BRG	Matthew	8	4	And Jesus saith unto him , See thou tell no man ; but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
BRG	Matthew	8	5	And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum , there came unto him a centurion , beseeching him ,
BRG	Matthew	8	6	And saying , Lord , my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy , grievously tormented .
BRG	Matthew	8	7	And Jesus saith unto him , I will come and heal him .
BRG	Matthew	8	9	For I am a man under authority , having soldiers under me : and I say to this man , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doeth it .
BRG	Matthew	8	10	When Jesus heard it , he marvelled , and said to them that followed , Verily I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
BRG	Matthew	8	11	And I say unto you , That many shall come from the east and west , and shall sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , in the kingdom of heaven .
BRG	Matthew	8	12	But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
BRG	Matthew	8	13	And Jesus said unto the centurion , Go thy way ; and as thou hast believed , so be it done unto thee . And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour .
BRG	Matthew	8	14	And when Jesus was come into Peter ’ s house , he saw his wife ’ s mother laid , and sick of a fever .
BRG	Matthew	8	15	And he touched her hand , and the fever left her : and she arose , and ministered unto them .
BRG	Matthew	8	16	When the even was come , they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils : and he cast out the spirits with his word , and healed all that were sick :
BRG	Matthew	8	17	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet , saying , Himself took our infirmities , and bare our sicknesses .
BRG	Matthew	8	18	Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him , he gave commandment to depart unto the other side .
BRG	Matthew	8	19	And a certain scribe came , and said unto him , Master , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
BRG	Matthew	8	20	And Jesus saith unto him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
BRG	Matthew	8	21	And another of his disciples said unto him , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
BRG	Matthew	8	22	But Jesus said unto him , Follow me ; and let the dead bury their dead .
BRG	Matthew	8	23	And when he was entered into a ship , his disciples followed him .
BRG	Matthew	8	24	And , behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves : but he was asleep .
BRG	Matthew	8	25	And his disciples came to him , and awoke him , saying , Lord , save us : we perish .
BRG	Matthew	8	26	And he saith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? Then he arose , and rebuked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm .
BRG	Matthew	8	27	But the men marvelled , saying , What manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him !
BRG	Matthew	8	28	And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes , there met him two possessed with devils , coming out of the tombs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way .
BRG	Matthew	8	29	And , behold , they cried out , saying , What have we to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God ? art thou come hither to torment us before the time ?
BRG	Matthew	8	30	And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding .
BRG	Matthew	8	31	So the devils besought him , saying , If thou cast us out , suffer us to go away into the herd of swine .
BRG	Matthew	8	32	And he said unto them , Go . And when they were come out , they went into the herd of swine : and , behold , the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea , and perished in the waters .
BRG	Matthew	8	33	And they that kept them fled , and went their ways into the city , and told every thing , and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils .
BRG	Matthew	8	34	And , behold , the whole city came out to meet Jesus : and when they saw him , they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Matthew	9	9	And as Jesus passed forth from thence , he saw a man , named Matthew , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he saith unto him , Follow me . And he arose , and followed him .
BRG	Matthew	9	2	And , behold , they brought to him a man sick of the palsy , lying on a bed : and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy ; Son , be of good cheer ; thy sins be forgiven thee .
BRG	Matthew	9	3	And , behold , certain of the scribes said within themselves , This man blasphemeth .
BRG	Matthew	9	4	And Jesus knowing their thoughts said , Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts ?
BRG	Matthew	9	5	For whether is easier , to say , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Arise , and walk ?
BRG	Matthew	9	6	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( then saith he to the sick of the palsy , ) Arise , take up thy bed , and go unto thine house .
BRG	Matthew	9	7	And he arose , and departed to his house .
BRG	Matthew	9	8	But when the multitudes saw it , they marvelled , and glorified God , which had given such power unto men .
BRG	Matthew	9	10	And it came to pass , as Jesus sat at meat in the house , behold , many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples .
BRG	Matthew	9	11	And when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto his disciples , Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners ?
BRG	Matthew	9	12	But when Jesus heard that , he said unto them , They that be whole need not a physician , but they that are sick .
BRG	Matthew	9	13	But go ye and learn what that meaneth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice : for I am not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
BRG	Matthew	9	14	Then came to him the disciples of John , saying , Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft , but thy disciples fast not ?
BRG	Matthew	9	15	And Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bridechamber mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken from them , and then shall they fast .
BRG	Matthew	9	16	No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment , for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment , and the rent is made worse .
BRG	Matthew	9	17	Neither do men put new wine into old bottles : else the bottles break , and the wine runneth out , and the bottles perish : but they put new wine into new bottles , and both are preserved .
BRG	Matthew	9	18	While he spake these things unto them , behold , there came a certain ruler , and worshipped him , saying , My daughter is even now dead : but come and lay thy hand upon her , and she shall live .
BRG	Matthew	9	19	And Jesus arose , and followed him , and so did his disciples .
BRG	Matthew	9	20	And , behold , a woman , which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the hem of his garment :
BRG	Matthew	9	21	For she said within herself , If I may but touch his garment , I shall be whole .
BRG	Matthew	9	22	But Jesus turned him about , and when he saw her , he said , Daughter , be of good comfort ; thy faith hath made thee whole . And the woman was made whole from that hour .
BRG	Matthew	9	23	And when Jesus came into the ruler ’ s house , and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise ,
BRG	Matthew	9	24	He said unto them , Give place : for the maid is not dead , but sleepeth . And they laughed him to scorn .
BRG	Matthew	9	25	But when the people were put forth , he went in , and took her by the hand , and the maid arose .
BRG	Matthew	9	26	And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land .
BRG	Matthew	9	27	And when Jesus departed thence , two blind men followed him , crying , and saying , Thou Son of David , have mercy on us .
BRG	Matthew	9	28	And when he was come into the house , the blind men came to him : and Jesus saith unto them , Believe ye that I am able to do this ? They said unto him , Yea , Lord .
BRG	Matthew	9	29	Then touched he their eyes , saying , According to your faith be it unto you .
BRG	Matthew	9	30	And their eyes were opened ; and Jesus straitly charged them , saying , See that no man know it .
BRG	Matthew	9	31	But they , when they were departed , spread abroad his fame in all that country .
BRG	Matthew	9	32	As they went out , behold , they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil .
BRG	Matthew	9	33	And when the devil was cast out , the dumb spake : and the multitudes marvelled , saying , It was never so seen in Israel .
BRG	Matthew	9	34	But the Pharisees said , He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils .
BRG	Matthew	9	35	And Jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every sickness and every disease among the people .
BRG	Matthew	9	36	But when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion on them , because they fainted , and were scattered abroad , as sheep having no shepherd .

BRG	Matthew	10	10	Nor scrip for your journey , neither two coats , neither shoes , nor yet staves : for the workman is worthy of his meat .
BRG	Matthew	10	2	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these ; The first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother ;
BRG	Matthew	10	3	Philip , and Bartholomew ; Thomas , and Matthew the publican ; James the son of Alphaeus , and Lebbaeus , whose surname was Thaddaeus ;
BRG	Matthew	10	4	Simon the Canaanite , and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him .
BRG	Matthew	10	5	These twelve Jesus sent forth , and commanded them , saying , Go not into the way of the Gentiles , and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not :
BRG	Matthew	10	6	But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
BRG	Matthew	10	7	And as ye go , preach , saying , The kingdom of heaven is at hand .
BRG	Matthew	10	8	Heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out devils : freely ye have received , freely give .
BRG	Matthew	10	9	Provide neither gold , nor silver , nor brass in your purses ,
BRG	Matthew	10	11	And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter , enquire who in it is worthy ; and there abide till ye go thence .
BRG	Matthew	10	12	And when ye come into an house , salute it .
BRG	Matthew	10	13	And if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you .
BRG	Matthew	10	14	And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , when ye depart out of that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet .
BRG	Matthew	10	15	Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
BRG	Matthew	10	16	Behold , I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves : be ye therefore wise as serpents , and harmless as doves .
BRG	Matthew	10	17	But beware of men : for they will deliver you up to the councils , and they will scourge you in their synagogues ;
BRG	Matthew	10	18	And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them and the Gentiles .
BRG	Matthew	10	19	But when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
BRG	Matthew	10	20	For it is not ye that speak , but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you .
BRG	Matthew	10	21	And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death , and the father the child : and the children shall rise up against their parents , and cause them to be put to death .
BRG	Matthew	10	22	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name ’ s sake : but he that endureth to the end shall be saved .
BRG	Matthew	10	23	But when they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily I say unto you , Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come .
BRG	Matthew	10	24	The disciple is not above his master , nor the servant above his lord .
BRG	Matthew	10	25	It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master , and the servant as his lord . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
BRG	Matthew	10	26	Fear them not therefore : for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known .
BRG	Matthew	10	27	What I tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear , that preach ye upon the housetops .
BRG	Matthew	10	28	And fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
BRG	Matthew	10	29	Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father .
BRG	Matthew	10	30	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
BRG	Matthew	10	31	Fear ye not therefore , ye are of more value than many sparrows .
BRG	Matthew	10	32	Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men , him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven .
BRG	Matthew	10	33	But whosoever shall deny me before men , him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven .
BRG	Matthew	10	34	Think not that I am come to send peace on earth : I came not to send peace , but a sword .
BRG	Matthew	10	35	For I am come to set a man at variance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
BRG	Matthew	10	36	And a man ’ s foes shall be they of his own household .
BRG	Matthew	10	37	He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me : and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
BRG	Matthew	10	38	And he that taketh not his cross , and followeth after me , is not worthy of me .

BRG	Matthew	11	11	Verily I say unto you , Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist : notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
BRG	Matthew	11	2	Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ , he sent two of his disciples ,
BRG	Matthew	11	3	And said unto him , Art thou he that should come , or do we look for another ?
BRG	Matthew	11	4	Jesus answered and said unto them , Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see :
BRG	Matthew	11	5	The blind receive their sight , and the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have the gospel preached to them .
BRG	Matthew	11	6	And blessed is he , whosoever shall not be offended in me .
BRG	Matthew	11	7	And as they departed , Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken with the wind ?
BRG	Matthew	11	8	But what went ye out for to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they that wear soft clothing are in kings ’ houses .
BRG	Matthew	11	9	But what went ye out for to see ? A prophet ? yea , I say unto you , and more than a prophet .
BRG	Matthew	11	10	For this is he , of whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
BRG	Matthew	11	12	And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence , and the violent take it by force .
BRG	Matthew	11	13	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John .
BRG	Matthew	11	14	And if ye will receive it , this is Elias , which was for to come .
BRG	Matthew	11	15	He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
BRG	Matthew	11	16	But whereunto shall I liken this generation ? It is like unto children sitting in the markets , and calling unto their fellows ,
BRG	Matthew	11	17	And saying , We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned unto you , and ye have not lamented .
BRG	Matthew	11	18	For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , He hath a devil .
BRG	Matthew	11	19	The Son of man came eating and drinking , and they say , Behold a man gluttonous , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners . But wisdom is justified of her children .
BRG	Matthew	11	20	Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done , because they repented not :
BRG	Matthew	11	21	Woe unto thee , Chorazin ! woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works , which were done in you , had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
BRG	Matthew	11	22	But I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment , than for you .
BRG	Matthew	11	23	And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted unto heaven , shalt be brought down to hell : for if the mighty works , which have been done in thee , had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day .
BRG	Matthew	11	24	But I say unto you , That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment , than for thee .
BRG	Matthew	11	25	At that time Jesus answered and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes .

BRG	Matthew	11	27	All things are delivered unto me of my Father : and no man knoweth the Son , but the Father ; neither knoweth any man the Father , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him .

BRG	Matthew	12	12	How much then is a man better than a sheep ? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days .
BRG	Matthew	12	2	But when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto him , Behold , thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day .
BRG	Matthew	12	3	But he said unto them , Have ye not read what David did , when he was an hungred , and they that were with him ;
BRG	Matthew	12	4	How he entered into the house of God , and did eat the shewbread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for them which were with him , but only for the priests ?
BRG	Matthew	12	5	Or have ye not read in the law , how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are blameless ?
BRG	Matthew	12	6	But I say unto you , That in this place is one greater than the temple .
BRG	Matthew	12	7	But if ye had known what this meaneth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guiltless .
BRG	Matthew	12	8	For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day .
BRG	Matthew	12	9	And when he was departed thence , he went into their synagogue :
BRG	Matthew	12	10	And , behold , there was a man which had his hand withered . And they asked him , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days ? that they might accuse him .
BRG	Matthew	12	11	And he said unto them , What man shall there be among you , that shall have one sheep , and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day , will he not lay hold on it , and lift it out ?
BRG	Matthew	12	13	Then saith he to the man , Stretch forth thine hand . And he stretched it forth ; and it was restored whole , like as the other .
BRG	Matthew	12	14	Then the Pharisees went out , and held a council against him , how they might destroy him .
BRG	Matthew	12	15	But when Jesus knew it , he withdrew himself from thence : and great multitudes followed him , and he healed them all ;
BRG	Matthew	12	16	And charged them that they should not make him known :
BRG	Matthew	12	17	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet , saying ,
BRG	Matthew	12	18	Behold my servant , whom I have chosen ; my beloved , in whom my soul is well pleased : I will put my Spirit upon him , and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles . ( A )
BRG	Matthew	12	19	He shall not strive , nor cry ; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets . ( B )
BRG	Matthew	12	20	A bruised reed shall he not break , and smoking flax shall he not quench , till he send forth judgment unto victory . ( C )
BRG	Matthew	12	21	And in his name shall the Gentiles trust . ( D )
BRG	Matthew	12	22	Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil , blind , and dumb : and he healed him , insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw .
BRG	Matthew	12	23	And all the people were amazed , and said , Is not this the son of David ?
BRG	Matthew	12	24	But when the Pharisees heard it , they said , This fellow doth not cast out devils , but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils .
BRG	Matthew	12	25	And Jesus knew their thoughts , and said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand :
BRG	Matthew	12	26	And if Satan cast out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how shall then his kingdom stand ?
BRG	Matthew	12	27	And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your children cast them out ? therefore they shall be your judges .
BRG	Matthew	12	28	But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God is come unto you .
BRG	Matthew	12	29	Or else how can one enter into a strong man ’ s house , and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong man ? and then he will spoil his house .
BRG	Matthew	12	30	He that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad .
BRG	Matthew	12	31	Wherefore I say unto you , All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men : but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men .
BRG	Matthew	12	32	And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
BRG	Matthew	12	33	Either make the tree good , and his fruit good ; or else make the tree corrupt , and his fruit corrupt : for the tree is known by his fruit .
BRG	Matthew	12	34	O generation of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
BRG	Matthew	12	35	A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things : and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things .
BRG	Matthew	12	36	But I say unto you , That every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .
BRG	Matthew	12	37	For by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned .
BRG	Matthew	12	38	Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered , saying , Master , we would see a sign from thee .
BRG	Matthew	12	39	But he answered and said unto them , An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given to it , but the sign of the prophet Jonas :
BRG	Matthew	12	40	For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale ’ s belly ; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
BRG	Matthew	12	41	The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and , behold , a greater than Jonas is here .
BRG	Matthew	12	42	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and , behold , a greater than Solomon is here .
BRG	Matthew	12	43	When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest , and findeth none .
BRG	Matthew	12	44	Then he saith , I will return into my house from whence I came out ; and when he is come , he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished .
BRG	Matthew	12	45	Then goeth he , and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first . Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation .
BRG	Matthew	12	46	While he yet talked to the people , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , desiring to speak with him .
BRG	Matthew	12	47	Then one said unto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to speak with thee .
BRG	Matthew	12	48	But he answered and said unto him that told him , Who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ?
BRG	Matthew	12	49	And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples , and said , Behold my mother and my brethren !

BRG	Matthew	13	4	And when he sowed , some seeds fell by the way side , and the fowls came and devoured them up :
BRG	Matthew	13	5	Some fell upon stony places , where they had not much earth : and forthwith they sprung up , because they had no deepness of earth :
BRG	Matthew	13	6	And when the sun was up , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away .
BRG	Matthew	13	7	And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprung up , and choked them :
BRG	Matthew	13	8	But other fell into good ground , and brought forth fruit , some an hundredfold , some sixtyfold , some thirtyfold .
BRG	Matthew	13	9	Who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
BRG	Matthew	13	10	And the disciples came , and said unto him , Why speakest thou unto them in parables ?
BRG	Matthew	13	11	He answered and said unto them , Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given .
BRG	Matthew	13	12	For whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have more abundance : but whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that he hath .
BRG	Matthew	13	14	And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias , which saith , By hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and shall not perceive :
BRG	Matthew	13	15	For this people ’ s heart is waxed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes they have closed ; lest at any time they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and should understand with their heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them .
BRG	Matthew	13	16	But blessed are your eyes , for they see : and your ears , for they hear .
BRG	Matthew	13	17	For verily I say unto you , That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
BRG	Matthew	13	18	Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower .
BRG	Matthew	13	19	When any one heareth the word of the kingdom , and understandeth it not , then cometh the wicked one , and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart . This is he which received seed by the way side .
BRG	Matthew	13	20	But he that received the seed into stony places , the same is he that heareth the word , and anon with joy receiveth it ;
BRG	Matthew	13	21	Yet hath he not root in himself , but dureth for a while : for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , by and by he is offended .
BRG	Matthew	13	22	He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word ; and the care of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , choke the word , and he becometh unfruitful .
BRG	Matthew	13	23	But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word , and understandeth it ; which also beareth fruit , and bringeth forth , some an hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
BRG	Matthew	13	24	Another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field :
BRG	Matthew	13	25	But while men slept , his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat , and went his way .
BRG	Matthew	13	26	But when the blade was sprung up , and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also .
BRG	Matthew	13	27	So the servants of the householder came and said unto him , Sir , didst not thou sow good seed in thy field ? from whence then hath it tares ?
BRG	Matthew	13	28	He said unto them , An enemy hath done this . The servants said unto him , Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up ?
BRG	Matthew	13	29	But he said , Nay ; lest while ye gather up the tares , ye root up also the wheat with them .
BRG	Matthew	13	30	Let both grow together until the harvest : and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers , Gather ye together first the tares , and bind them in bundles to burn them : but gather the wheat into my barn .
BRG	Matthew	13	31	Another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field :
BRG	Matthew	13	32	Which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof .
BRG	Matthew	13	33	Another parable spake he unto them ; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
BRG	Matthew	13	34	All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables ; and without a parable spake he not unto them :
BRG	Matthew	13	35	That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying , I will open my mouth in parables ; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world .
BRG	Matthew	13	36	Then Jesus sent the multitude away , and went into the house : and his disciples came unto him , saying , Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field .
BRG	Matthew	13	37	He answered and said unto them , He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man ;
BRG	Matthew	13	38	The field is the world ; the good seed are the children of the kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked one ;
BRG	Matthew	13	39	The enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are the angels .
BRG	Matthew	13	40	As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire ; so shall it be in the end of this world .
BRG	Matthew	13	41	The Son of man shall send forth his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend , and them which do iniquity ;
BRG	Matthew	13	42	And shall cast them into a furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
BRG	Matthew	13	43	Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . Who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
BRG	Matthew	13	44	Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field ; the which when a man hath found , he hideth , and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath , and buyeth that field .
BRG	Matthew	13	45	Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man , seeking goodly pearls :
BRG	Matthew	13	46	Who , when he had found one pearl of great price , went and sold all that he had , and bought it .
BRG	Matthew	13	47	Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered of every kind :
BRG	Matthew	13	48	Which , when it was full , they drew to shore , and sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but cast the bad away .
BRG	Matthew	13	49	So shall it be at the end of the world : the angels shall come forth , and sever the wicked from among the just ,
BRG	Matthew	13	50	And shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
BRG	Matthew	13	51	Jesus saith unto them , Have ye understood all these things ? They say unto him , Yea , Lord .
BRG	Matthew	13	52	Then said he unto them , Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder , which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old .
BRG	Matthew	13	53	And it came to pass , that when Jesus had finished these parables , he departed thence .
BRG	Matthew	13	54	And when he was come into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , insomuch that they were astonished , and said , Whence hath this man this wisdom , and these mighty works ?
BRG	Matthew	13	55	Is not this the carpenter ’ s son ? is not his mother called Mary ? and his brethren , James , and Joses , and Simon , and Judas ?
BRG	Matthew	13	56	And his sisters , are they not all with us ? Whence then hath this man all these things ?
BRG	Matthew	13	57	And they were offended in him . But Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honour , save in his own country , and in his own house .
BRG	Matthew	13	58	And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Matthew	14	14	And Jesus went forth , and saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion toward them , and he healed their sick .
BRG	Matthew	14	2	And said unto his servants , This is John the Baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
BRG	Matthew	14	3	For Herod had laid hold on John , and bound him , and put him in prison for Herodias ’ sake , his brother Philip ’ s wife .
BRG	Matthew	14	4	For John said unto him , It is not lawful for thee to have her .
BRG	Matthew	14	5	And when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
BRG	Matthew	14	6	But when Herod ’ s birthday was kept , the daughter of Herodias danced before them , and pleased Herod .
BRG	Matthew	14	7	Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask .
BRG	Matthew	14	8	And she , being before instructed of her mother , said , Give me here John Baptist ’ s head in a charger .
BRG	Matthew	14	9	And the king was sorry : nevertheless for the oath ’ s sake , and them which sat with him at meat , he commanded it to be given her .
BRG	Matthew	14	10	And he sent , and beheaded John in the prison .
BRG	Matthew	14	11	And his head was brought in a charger , and given to the damsel : and she brought it to her mother .
BRG	Matthew	14	12	And his disciples came , and took up the body , and buried it , and went and told Jesus .
BRG	Matthew	14	13	When Jesus heard of it , he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart : and when the people had heard thereof , they followed him on foot out of the cities .
BRG	Matthew	14	15	And when it was evening , his disciples came to him , saying , This is a desert place , and the time is now past ; send the multitude away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves victuals .
BRG	Matthew	14	16	But Jesus said unto them , They need not depart ; give ye them to eat .
BRG	Matthew	14	17	And they say unto him , We have here but five loaves , and two fishes .
BRG	Matthew	14	18	He said , Bring them hither to me .
BRG	Matthew	14	19	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass , and took the five loaves , and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , and brake , and gave the loaves to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
BRG	Matthew	14	20	And they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full .
BRG	Matthew	14	21	And they that had eaten were about five thousand men , beside women and children .
BRG	Matthew	14	22	And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship , and to go before him unto the other side , while he sent the multitudes away .
BRG	Matthew	14	23	And when he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into a mountain apart to pray : and when the evening was come , he was there alone .
BRG	Matthew	14	24	But the ship was now in the midst of the sea , tossed with waves : for the wind was contrary .
BRG	Matthew	14	25	And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them , walking on the sea .
BRG	Matthew	14	26	And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , It is a spirit ; and they cried out for fear .
BRG	Matthew	14	27	But straightway Jesus spake unto them , saying , Be of good cheer ; it is I ; be not afraid .
BRG	Matthew	14	28	And Peter answered him and said , Lord , if it be thou , bid me come unto thee on the water .
BRG	Matthew	14	29	And he said , Come . And when Peter was come down out of the ship , he walked on the water , to go to Jesus .
BRG	Matthew	14	30	But when he saw the wind boisterous , he was afraid ; and beginning to sink , he cried , saying , Lord , save me .
BRG	Matthew	14	31	And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand , and caught him , and said unto him , O thou of little faith , wherefore didst thou doubt ?
BRG	Matthew	14	32	And when they were come into the ship , the wind ceased .
BRG	Matthew	14	33	Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him , saying , Of a truth thou art the Son of God .
BRG	Matthew	14	34	And when they were gone over , they came into the land of Gennesaret .
BRG	Matthew	14	35	And when the men of that place had knowledge of him , they sent out into all that country round about , and brought unto him all that were diseased ;
BRG	Matthew	14	36	And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment : and as many as touched were made perfectly whole . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Matthew	15	15	Then answered Peter and said unto him , Declare unto us this parable .
BRG	Matthew	15	2	Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread .
BRG	Matthew	15	3	But he answered and said unto them , Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition ?
BRG	Matthew	15	4	For God commanded , saying , Honour thy father and mother : and , He that curseth father or mother , let him die the death .
BRG	Matthew	15	5	But ye say , Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , It is a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me ;
BRG	Matthew	15	6	And honour not his father or his mother , he shall be free . Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition .
BRG	Matthew	15	7	Ye hypocrites , well did Esaias prophesy of you , saying ,
BRG	Matthew	15	8	This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth , and honoureth me with their lips ; but their heart is far from me .
BRG	Matthew	15	9	But in vain they do worship me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men .
BRG	Matthew	15	10	And he called the multitude , and said unto them , Hear , and understand :
BRG	Matthew	15	11	Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man ; but that which cometh out of the mouth , this defileth a man .
BRG	Matthew	15	12	Then came his disciples , and said unto him , Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended , after they heard this saying ?
BRG	Matthew	15	13	But he answered and said , Every plant , which my heavenly Father hath not planted , shall be rooted up .
BRG	Matthew	15	14	Let them alone : they be blind leaders of the blind . And if the blind lead the blind , both shall fall into the ditch .
BRG	Matthew	15	16	And Jesus said , Are ye also yet without understanding ?
BRG	Matthew	15	17	Do not ye yet understand , that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ?
BRG	Matthew	15	18	But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart ; and they defile the man .
BRG	Matthew	15	19	For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , blasphemies :
BRG	Matthew	15	20	These are the things which defile a man : but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man .
BRG	Matthew	15	21	Then Jesus went thence , and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon .
BRG	Matthew	15	22	And , behold , a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts , and cried unto him , saying , Have mercy on me , O Lord , thou Son of David ; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil .
BRG	Matthew	15	23	But he answered her not a word . And his disciples came and besought him , saying , Send her away ; for she crieth after us .
BRG	Matthew	15	24	But he answered and said , I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
BRG	Matthew	15	25	Then came she and worshipped him , saying , Lord , help me .
BRG	Matthew	15	26	But he answered and said , It is not meet to take the children ’ s bread , and to cast it to dogs .
BRG	Matthew	15	27	And she said , Truth , Lord : yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters ’ table .
BRG	Matthew	15	28	Then Jesus answered and said unto her , O woman , great is thy faith : be it unto thee even as thou wilt . And her daughter was made whole from that very hour .
BRG	Matthew	15	29	And Jesus departed from thence , and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee ; and went up into a mountain , and sat down there .
BRG	Matthew	15	30	And great multitudes came unto him , having with them those that were lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and cast them down at Jesus ’ feet ; and he healed them :
BRG	Matthew	15	31	Insomuch that the multitude wondered , when they saw the dumb to speak , the maimed to be whole , the lame to walk , and the blind to see : and they glorified the God of Israel .
BRG	Matthew	15	32	Then Jesus called his disciples unto him , and said , I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat : and I will not send them away fasting , lest they faint in the way .
BRG	Matthew	15	33	And his disciples say unto him , Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness , as to fill so great a multitude ?
BRG	Matthew	15	34	And Jesus saith unto them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven , and a few little fishes .
BRG	Matthew	15	35	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground .
BRG	Matthew	15	36	And he took the seven loaves and the fishes , and gave thanks , and brake them , and gave to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
BRG	Matthew	15	37	And they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full .
BRG	Matthew	15	38	And they that did eat were four thousand men , beside women and children .

BRG	Matthew	16	16	And Simon Peter answered and said , Thou art the Christ , the Son of the living God .
BRG	Matthew	16	2	He answered and said unto them , When it is evening , ye say , It will be fair weather : for the sky is red .
BRG	Matthew	16	3	And in the morning , It will be foul weather to day : for the sky is red and lowring . O ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky ; but can ye not discern the signs of the times ?
BRG	Matthew	16	4	A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given unto it , but the sign of the prophet Jonas . And he left them , and departed .
BRG	Matthew	16	5	And when his disciples were come to the other side , they had forgotten to take bread .
BRG	Matthew	16	6	Then Jesus said unto them , Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees .
BRG	Matthew	16	7	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have taken no bread .
BRG	Matthew	16	8	Which when Jesus perceived , he said unto them , O ye of little faith , why reason ye among yourselves , because ye have brought no bread ?
BRG	Matthew	16	9	Do ye not yet understand , neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
BRG	Matthew	16	10	Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
BRG	Matthew	16	11	How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread , that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees ?
BRG	Matthew	16	12	Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread , but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees .
BRG	Matthew	16	13	When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , Whom do men say that I the Son of man am ?
BRG	Matthew	16	14	And they said , Some say that thou art John the Baptist : some , Elias ; and others , Jeremias , or one of the prophets .
BRG	Matthew	16	15	He saith unto them , But whom say ye that I am ?
BRG	Matthew	16	17	And Jesus answered and said unto him , Blessed art thou , Simon Bar-jona : for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee , but my Father which is in heaven .
BRG	Matthew	16	18	And I say also unto thee , That thou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it .
BRG	Matthew	16	19	And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
BRG	Matthew	16	20	Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ .
BRG	Matthew	16	21	From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples , how that he must go unto Jerusalem , and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and be raised again the third day .
BRG	Matthew	16	22	Then Peter took him , and began to rebuke him , saying , Be it far from thee , Lord : this shall not be unto thee .
BRG	Matthew	16	23	But he turned , and said unto Peter , Get thee behind me , Satan : thou art an offence unto me : for thou savourest not the things that be of God , but those that be of men .
BRG	Matthew	16	24	Then said Jesus unto his disciples , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
BRG	Matthew	16	25	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it : and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it .
BRG	Matthew	16	26	For what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
BRG	Matthew	16	27	For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels ; and then he shall reward every man according to his works .

BRG	Matthew	17	16	And I brought him to thy disciples , and they could not cure him .

BRG	Matthew	17	19	Then came the disciples to Jesus apart , and said , Why could not we cast him out ?
BRG	Matthew	17	20	And Jesus said unto them , Because of your unbelief : for verily I say unto you , If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye shall say unto this mountain , Remove hence to yonder place ; and it shall remove ; and nothing shall be impossible unto you .
BRG	Matthew	17	21	Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting .
BRG	Matthew	17	22	And while they abode in Galilee , Jesus said unto them , The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men :

BRG	Matthew	18	13	And if so be that he find it , verily I say unto you , he rejoiceth more of that sheep , than of the ninety and nine which went not astray .
BRG	Matthew	18	14	Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven , that one of these little ones should perish .
BRG	Matthew	18	15	Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee , go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone : if he shall hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother .
BRG	Matthew	18	16	But if he will not hear thee , then take with thee one or two more , that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
BRG	Matthew	18	17	And if he shall neglect to hear them , tell it unto the church : but if he neglect to hear the church , let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican .
BRG	Matthew	18	19	Again I say unto you , That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven .
BRG	Matthew	18	20	For where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am I in the midst of them .
BRG	Matthew	18	21	Then came Peter to him , and said , Lord , how oft shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? till seven times ?
BRG	Matthew	18	22	Jesus saith unto him , I say not unto thee , Until seven times : but , Until seventy times seven .
BRG	Matthew	18	23	Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king , which would take account of his servants .
BRG	Matthew	18	24	And when he had begun to reckon , one was brought unto him , which owed him ten thousand talents .
BRG	Matthew	18	25	But forasmuch as he had not to pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , and his wife , and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
BRG	Matthew	18	26	The servant therefore fell down , and worshipped him , saying , Lord , have patience with me , and I will pay thee all .
BRG	Matthew	18	27	Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion , and loosed him , and forgave him the debt .
BRG	Matthew	18	28	But the same servant went out , and found one of his fellowservants , which owed him an hundred pence : and he laid hands on him , and took him by the throat , saying , Pay me that thou owest .
BRG	Matthew	18	29	And his fellowservant fell down at his feet , and besought him , saying , Have patience with me , and I will pay thee all .
BRG	Matthew	18	30	And he would not : but went and cast him into prison , till he should pay the debt .
BRG	Matthew	18	31	So when his fellowservants saw what was done , they were very sorry , and came and told unto their lord all that was done .
BRG	Matthew	18	32	Then his lord , after that he had called him , said unto him , O thou wicked servant , I forgave thee all that debt , because thou desiredst me :
BRG	Matthew	18	33	Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant , even as I had pity on thee ?
BRG	Matthew	18	34	And his lord was wroth , and delivered him to the tormentors , till he should pay all that was due unto him .
BRG	Matthew	18	35	So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you , if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Matthew	19	19	Honour thy father and thy mother : and , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
BRG	Matthew	19	2	And great multitudes followed him ; and he healed them there .
BRG	Matthew	19	3	The Pharisees also came unto him , tempting him , and saying unto him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ?
BRG	Matthew	19	4	And he answered and said unto them , Have ye not read , that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female ,
BRG	Matthew	19	5	And said , For this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife : and they twain shall be one flesh ?
BRG	Matthew	19	6	Wherefore they are no more twain , but one flesh . What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
BRG	Matthew	19	7	They say unto him , Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement , and to put her away ?
BRG	Matthew	19	8	He saith unto them , Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so .
BRG	Matthew	19	9	And I say unto you , Whosoever shall put away his wife , except it be for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery .
BRG	Matthew	19	10	His disciples say unto him , If the case of the man be so with his wife , it is not good to marry .
BRG	Matthew	19	11	But he said unto them , All men can not receive this saying , save they to whom it is given .
BRG	Matthew	19	12	For there are some eunuchs , which were so born from their mother ’ s womb : and there are some eunuchs , which were made eunuchs of men : and there be eunuchs , which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven ’ s sake . He that is able to receive it , let him receive it .
BRG	Matthew	19	13	Then were there brought unto him little children , that he should put his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebuked them .
BRG	Matthew	19	14	But Jesus said , Suffer little children , and forbid them not , to come unto me : for of such is the kingdom of heaven .
BRG	Matthew	19	15	And he laid his hands on them , and departed thence .
BRG	Matthew	19	16	And , behold , one came and said unto him , Good Master , what good thing shall I do , that I may have eternal life ?
BRG	Matthew	19	17	And he said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , that is , God : but if thou wilt enter into life , keep the commandments .
BRG	Matthew	19	18	He saith unto him , Which ? Jesus said , Thou shalt do no murder , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false witness ,
BRG	Matthew	19	20	The young man saith unto him , All these things have I kept from my youth up : what lack I yet ?
BRG	Matthew	19	21	Jesus said unto him , If thou wilt be perfect , go and sell that thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come and follow me .
BRG	Matthew	19	22	But when the young man heard that saying , he went away sorrowful : for he had great possessions .
BRG	Matthew	19	23	Then said Jesus unto his disciples , Verily I say unto you , That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven .
BRG	Matthew	19	24	And again I say unto you , It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
BRG	Matthew	19	25	When his disciples heard it , they were exceedingly amazed , saying , Who then can be saved ?
BRG	Matthew	19	26	But Jesus beheld them , and said unto them , With men this is impossible ; but with God all things are possible .
BRG	Matthew	19	27	Then answered Peter and said unto him , Behold , we have forsaken all , and followed thee ; what shall we have therefore ?
BRG	Matthew	19	28	And Jesus said unto them , Verily I say unto you , That ye which have followed me , in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory , ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
BRG	Matthew	19	29	And every one that hath forsaken houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name ’ s sake , shall receive an hundredfold , and shall inherit everlasting life .

BRG	Matthew	20	20	Then came to him the mother of Zebedee ’ s children with her sons , worshipping him , and desiring a certain thing of him .
BRG	Matthew	20	2	And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
BRG	Matthew	20	3	And he went out about the third hour , and saw others standing idle in the marketplace ,
BRG	Matthew	20	4	And said unto them ; Go ye also into the vineyard , and whatsoever is right I will give you . And they went their way .
BRG	Matthew	20	5	Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour , and did likewise .
BRG	Matthew	20	6	And about the eleventh hour he went out , and found others standing idle , and saith unto them , Why stand ye here all the day idle ?
BRG	Matthew	20	7	They say unto him , Because no man hath hired us . He saith unto them , Go ye also into the vineyard ; and whatsoever is right , that shall ye receive .
BRG	Matthew	20	8	So when even was come , the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward , Call the labourers , and give them their hire , beginning from the last unto the first .
BRG	Matthew	20	9	And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour , they received every man a penny .
BRG	Matthew	20	10	But when the first came , they supposed that they should have received more ; and they likewise received every man a penny .
BRG	Matthew	20	11	And when they had received it , they murmured against the goodman of the house ,
BRG	Matthew	20	12	Saying , These last have wrought but one hour , and thou hast made them equal unto us , which have borne the burden and heat of the day .
BRG	Matthew	20	13	But he answered one of them , and said , Friend , I do thee no wrong : didst not thou agree with me for a penny ?
BRG	Matthew	20	14	Take that thine is , and go thy way : I will give unto this last , even as unto thee .
BRG	Matthew	20	15	Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own ? Is thine eye evil , because I am good ?
BRG	Matthew	20	16	So the last shall be first , and the first last : for many be called , but few chosen .
BRG	Matthew	20	17	And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way , and said unto them ,
BRG	Matthew	20	18	Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes , and they shall condemn him to death ,
BRG	Matthew	20	19	And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify him : and the third day he shall rise again .
BRG	Matthew	20	21	And he said unto her , What wilt thou ? She saith unto him , Grant that these my two sons may sit , the one on thy right hand , and the other on the left , in thy kingdom .
BRG	Matthew	20	22	But Jesus answered and said , Ye know not what ye ask . Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of , and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? They say unto him , We are able .
BRG	Matthew	20	23	And he saith unto them , Ye shall drink indeed of my cup , and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with : but to sit on my right hand , and on my left , is not mine to give , but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father .
BRG	Matthew	20	24	And when the ten heard it , they were moved with indignation against the two brethren .
BRG	Matthew	20	25	But Jesus called them unto him , and said , Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them , and they that are great exercise authority upon them .
BRG	Matthew	20	26	But it shall not be so among you : but whosoever will be great among you , let him be your minister ;
BRG	Matthew	20	27	And whosoever will be chief among you , let him be your servant :
BRG	Matthew	20	28	Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
BRG	Matthew	20	29	And as they departed from Jericho , a great multitude followed him .
BRG	Matthew	20	30	And , behold , two blind men sitting by the way side , when they heard that Jesus passed by , cried out , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou Son of David .
BRG	Matthew	20	31	And the multitude rebuked them , because they should hold their peace : but they cried the more , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou Son of David .
BRG	Matthew	20	32	And Jesus stood still , and called them , and said , What will ye that I shall do unto you ?
BRG	Matthew	20	33	They say unto him , Lord , that our eyes may be opened .

BRG	Matthew	21	21	Jesus answered and said unto them , Verily I say unto you , If ye have faith , and doubt not , ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree , but also if ye shall say unto this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; it shall be done .
BRG	Matthew	21	2	Saying unto them , Go into the village over against you , and straightway ye shall find an ass tied , and a colt with her : loose them , and bring them unto me .
BRG	Matthew	21	3	And if any man say ought unto you , ye shall say , The Lord hath need of them ; and straightway he will send them .
BRG	Matthew	21	4	All this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying ,
BRG	Matthew	21	5	Tell ye the daughter of Sion , Behold , thy King cometh unto thee , meek , and sitting upon an ass , and a colt the foal of an ass . ( A )
BRG	Matthew	21	6	And the disciples went , and did as Jesus commanded them ,
BRG	Matthew	21	7	And brought the ass , and the colt , and put on them their clothes , and they set him thereon .
BRG	Matthew	21	8	And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way ; others cut down branches from the trees , and strawed them in the way .
BRG	Matthew	21	9	And the multitudes that went before , and that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna to the Son of David : Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord ; Hosanna in the highest .
BRG	Matthew	21	10	And when he was come into Jerusalem , all the city was moved , saying , Who is this ?
BRG	Matthew	21	11	And the multitude said , This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee .
BRG	Matthew	21	12	And Jesus went into the temple of God , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ,
BRG	Matthew	21	13	And said unto them , It is written , My house shall be called the house of prayer ; but ye have made it a den of thieves .
BRG	Matthew	21	14	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple ; and he healed them .
BRG	Matthew	21	15	And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children crying in the temple , and saying , Hosanna to the Son of David ; they were sore displeased ,
BRG	Matthew	21	16	And said unto him , Hearest thou what these say ? And Jesus saith unto them , Yea ; have ye never read , Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ?
BRG	Matthew	21	17	And he left them , and went out of the city into Bethany ; and he lodged there .
BRG	Matthew	21	18	Now in the morning as he returned into the city , he hungered .
BRG	Matthew	21	19	And when he saw a fig tree in the way , he came to it , and found nothing thereon , but leaves only , and said unto it , Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever . And presently the fig tree withered away .
BRG	Matthew	21	20	And when the disciples saw it , they marvelled , saying , How soon is the fig tree withered away !
BRG	Matthew	21	22	And all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive .
BRG	Matthew	21	23	And when he was come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ?
BRG	Matthew	21	24	And Jesus answered and said unto them , I also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
BRG	Matthew	21	25	The baptism of John , whence was it ? from heaven , or of men ? And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say unto us , Why did ye not then believe him ?
BRG	Matthew	21	26	But if we shall say , Of men ; we fear the people ; for all hold John as a prophet .
BRG	Matthew	21	27	And they answered Jesus , and said , We can not tell . And he said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things .
BRG	Matthew	21	28	But what think ye ? A certain man had two sons ; and he came to the first , and said , Son , go work to day in my vineyard .
BRG	Matthew	21	29	He answered and said , I will not : but afterward he repented , and went .
BRG	Matthew	21	30	And he came to the second , and said likewise . And he answered and said , I go , sir : and went not .
BRG	Matthew	21	31	Whether of them twain did the will of his father ? They say unto him , The first . Jesus saith unto them , Verily I say unto you , That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you .
BRG	Matthew	21	32	For John came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not : but the publicans and the harlots believed him : and ye , when ye had seen it , repented not afterward , that ye might believe him .
BRG	Matthew	21	33	Hear another parable : There was a certain householder , which planted a vineyard , and hedged it round about , and digged a winepress in it , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a far country :
BRG	Matthew	21	34	And when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen , that they might receive the fruits of it .
BRG	Matthew	21	35	And the husbandmen took his servants , and beat one , and killed another , and stoned another .
BRG	Matthew	21	36	Again , he sent other servants more than the first : and they did unto them likewise .
BRG	Matthew	21	37	But last of all he sent unto them his son , saying , They will reverence my son .
BRG	Matthew	21	38	But when the husbandmen saw the son , they said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance .
BRG	Matthew	21	39	And they caught him , and cast him out of the vineyard , and slew him .
BRG	Matthew	21	40	When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh , what will he do unto those husbandmen ?
BRG	Matthew	21	41	They say unto him , He will miserably destroy those wicked men , and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen , which shall render him the fruits in their seasons .
BRG	Matthew	21	42	Jesus saith unto them , Did ye never read in the scriptures , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner : this is the Lord ’ s doing , and it is marvellous in our eyes ?
BRG	Matthew	21	43	Therefore say I unto you , The kingdom of God shall be taken from you , and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof .
BRG	Matthew	21	44	And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken : but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder .
BRG	Matthew	21	45	And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables , they perceived that he spake of them .

BRG	Matthew	22	22	When they had heard these words , they marvelled , and left him , and went their way .
BRG	Matthew	22	2	The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king , which made a marriage for his son ,
BRG	Matthew	22	3	And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding : and they would not come .
BRG	Matthew	22	4	Again , he sent forth other servants , saying , Tell them which are bidden , Behold , I have prepared my dinner : my oxen and my fatlings are killed , and all things are ready : come unto the marriage .
BRG	Matthew	22	5	But they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his farm , another to his merchandise :
BRG	Matthew	22	6	And the remnant took his servants , and entreated them spitefully , and slew them .
BRG	Matthew	22	7	But when the king heard thereof , he was wroth : and he sent forth his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned up their city .
BRG	Matthew	22	8	Then saith he to his servants , The wedding is ready , but they which were bidden were not worthy .
BRG	Matthew	22	9	Go ye therefore into the highways , and as many as ye shall find , bid to the marriage .
BRG	Matthew	22	10	So those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all as many as they found , both bad and good : and the wedding was furnished with guests .
BRG	Matthew	22	11	And when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment :
BRG	Matthew	22	12	And he saith unto him , Friend , how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment ? And he was speechless .
BRG	Matthew	22	13	Then said the king to the servants , Bind him hand and foot , and take him away , and cast him into outer darkness ; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
BRG	Matthew	22	14	For many are called , but few are chosen .
BRG	Matthew	22	15	Then went the Pharisees , and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk .
BRG	Matthew	22	16	And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians , saying , Master , we know that thou art true , and teachest the way of God in truth , neither carest thou for any man : for thou regardest not the person of men .
BRG	Matthew	22	17	Tell us therefore , What thinkest thou ? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar , or not ?
BRG	Matthew	22	18	But Jesus perceived their wickedness , and said , Why tempt ye me , ye hypocrites ?
BRG	Matthew	22	19	Shew me the tribute money . And they brought unto him a penny .
BRG	Matthew	22	20	And he saith unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ?
BRG	Matthew	22	21	They say unto him , Caesar ’ s . Then saith he unto them , Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar ’ s ; and unto God the things that are God ’ s .
BRG	Matthew	22	23	The same day came to him the Sadducees , which say that there is no resurrection , and asked him ,
BRG	Matthew	22	24	Saying , Master , Moses said , If a man die , having no children , his brother shall marry his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
BRG	Matthew	22	25	Now there were with us seven brethren : and the first , when he had married a wife , deceased , and , having no issue , left his wife unto his brother :
BRG	Matthew	22	26	Likewise the second also , and the third , unto the seventh .
BRG	Matthew	22	27	And last of all the woman died also .
BRG	Matthew	22	28	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven ? for they all had her .
BRG	Matthew	22	29	Jesus answered and said unto them , Ye do err , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God .
BRG	Matthew	22	30	For in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as the angels of God in heaven .
BRG	Matthew	22	31	But as touching the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God , saying ,
BRG	Matthew	22	32	I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not the God of the dead , but of the living .
BRG	Matthew	22	33	And when the multitude heard this , they were astonished at his doctrine .
BRG	Matthew	22	34	But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence , they were gathered together .
BRG	Matthew	22	35	Then one of them , which was a lawyer , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying ,
BRG	Matthew	22	36	Master , which is the great commandment in the law ?
BRG	Matthew	22	37	Jesus said unto him , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind .
BRG	Matthew	22	38	This is the first and great commandment .
BRG	Matthew	22	39	And the second is like unto it , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
BRG	Matthew	22	40	On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets .
BRG	Matthew	22	41	While the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them ,
BRG	Matthew	22	42	Saying , What think ye of Christ ? whose son is he ? They say unto him , The Son of David .
BRG	Matthew	22	43	He saith unto them , How then doth David in Spirit call him Lord , saying ,
BRG	Matthew	22	44	The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool ?
BRG	Matthew	22	45	If David then call him Lord , how is he his son ?
BRG	Matthew	22	46	And no man was able to answer him a word , neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Matthew	23	21	And whoso shall swear by the temple , sweareth by it , and by him that dwelleth therein .
BRG	Matthew	23	22	And he that shall swear by heaven , sweareth by the throne of God , and by him that sitteth thereon .
BRG	Matthew	23	24	Ye blind guides , which strain at a gnat , and swallow a camel .
BRG	Matthew	23	25	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and excess .
BRG	Matthew	23	26	Thou blind Pharisee , cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter , that the outside of them may be clean also .
BRG	Matthew	23	27	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres , which indeed appear beautiful outward , but are within full of dead men ’ s bones , and of all uncleanness .
BRG	Matthew	23	28	Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men , but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
BRG	Matthew	23	29	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye build the tombs of the prophets , and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous ,
BRG	Matthew	23	30	And say , If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
BRG	Matthew	23	31	Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves , that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets .
BRG	Matthew	23	32	Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers .
BRG	Matthew	23	33	Ye serpents , ye generation of vipers , how can ye escape the damnation of hell ?
BRG	Matthew	23	34	Wherefore , behold , I send unto you prophets , and wise men , and scribes : and some of them ye shall kill and crucify ; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues , and persecute them from city to city :
BRG	Matthew	23	35	That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth , from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias , whom ye slew between the temple and the altar .
BRG	Matthew	23	36	Verily I say unto you , All these things shall come upon this generation .
BRG	Matthew	23	37	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , thou that killest the prophets , and stonest them which are sent unto thee , how often would I have gathered thy children together , even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not !
BRG	Matthew	23	38	Behold , your house is left unto you desolate .
BRG	Matthew	23	39	For I say unto you , Ye shall not see me henceforth , till ye shall say , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Matthew	24	24	For there shall arise false Christs , and false prophets , and shall shew great signs and wonders ; insomuch that , if it were possible , they shall deceive the very elect .
BRG	Matthew	24	2	And Jesus said unto them , See ye not all these things ? verily I say unto you , There shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
BRG	Matthew	24	3	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives , the disciples came unto him privately , saying , Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign of thy coming , and of the end of the world ?
BRG	Matthew	24	4	And Jesus answered and said unto them , Take heed that no man deceive you .
BRG	Matthew	24	5	For many shall come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and shall deceive many .
BRG	Matthew	24	6	And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars : see that ye be not troubled : for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
BRG	Matthew	24	7	For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be famines , and pestilences , and earthquakes , in divers places .
BRG	Matthew	24	8	All these are the beginning of sorrows .
BRG	Matthew	24	9	Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted , and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name ’ s sake .
BRG	Matthew	24	10	And then shall many be offended , and shall betray one another , and shall hate one another .
BRG	Matthew	24	11	And many false prophets shall rise , and shall deceive many .
BRG	Matthew	24	12	And because iniquity shall abound , the love of many shall wax cold .
BRG	Matthew	24	13	But he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
BRG	Matthew	24	14	And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come .
BRG	Matthew	24	15	When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , stand in the holy place , ( whoso readeth , let him understand : )
BRG	Matthew	24	16	Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains :
BRG	Matthew	24	17	Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house :
BRG	Matthew	24	18	Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes .
BRG	Matthew	24	19	And woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
BRG	Matthew	24	20	But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter , neither on the sabbath day :
BRG	Matthew	24	21	For then shall be great tribulation , such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time , no , nor ever shall be .
BRG	Matthew	24	22	And except those days should be shortened , there should no flesh be saved : but for the elect ’ s sake those days shall be shortened .
BRG	Matthew	24	23	Then if any man shall say unto you , Lo , here is Christ , or there ; believe it not .
BRG	Matthew	24	25	Behold , I have told you before .
BRG	Matthew	24	26	Wherefore if they shall say unto you , Behold , he is in the desert ; go not forth : behold , he is in the secret chambers ; believe it not .
BRG	Matthew	24	27	For as the lightning cometh out of the east , and shineth even unto the west ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
BRG	Matthew	24	28	For wheresoever the carcase is , there will the eagles be gathered together .
BRG	Matthew	24	29	Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken :
BRG	Matthew	24	30	And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven : and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn , and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
BRG	Matthew	24	31	And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
BRG	Matthew	24	32	Now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When his branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is nigh :
BRG	Matthew	24	33	So likewise ye , when ye shall see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors .
BRG	Matthew	24	34	Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled .
BRG	Matthew	24	35	Heaven and earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away .
BRG	Matthew	24	36	But of that day and hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels of heaven , but my Father only .
BRG	Matthew	24	37	But as the days of Noe were , so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
BRG	Matthew	24	38	For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark ,
BRG	Matthew	24	39	And knew not until the flood came , and took them all away ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
BRG	Matthew	24	40	Then shall two be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
BRG	Matthew	24	41	Two women shall be grinding at the mill ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
BRG	Matthew	24	42	Watch therefore : for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come .
BRG	Matthew	24	43	But know this , that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
BRG	Matthew	24	44	Therefore be ye also ready : for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh .
BRG	Matthew	24	45	Who then is a faithful and wise servant , whom his lord hath made ruler over his household , to give them meat in due season ?
BRG	Matthew	24	46	Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
BRG	Matthew	24	47	Verily I say unto you , That he shall make him ruler over all his goods .
BRG	Matthew	24	48	But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ;
BRG	Matthew	24	49	And shall begin to smite his fellowservants , and to eat and drink with the drunken ;
BRG	Matthew	24	50	The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him , and in an hour that he is not aware of ,
BRG	Matthew	24	51	And shall cut him asunder , and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Matthew	25	25	And I was afraid , and went and hid thy talent in the earth : lo , there thou hast that is thine .
BRG	Matthew	25	2	And five of them were wise , and five were foolish .
BRG	Matthew	25	3	They that were foolish took their lamps , and took no oil with them :
BRG	Matthew	25	4	But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps .
BRG	Matthew	25	5	While the bridegroom tarried , they all slumbered and slept .
BRG	Matthew	25	6	And at midnight there was a cry made , Behold , the bridegroom cometh ; go ye out to meet him .
BRG	Matthew	25	7	Then all those virgins arose , and trimmed their lamps .
BRG	Matthew	25	8	And the foolish said unto the wise , Give us of your oil ; for our lamps are gone out .
BRG	Matthew	25	9	But the wise answered , saying , Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .
BRG	Matthew	25	10	And while they went to buy , the bridegroom came ; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage : and the door was shut .
BRG	Matthew	25	11	Afterward came also the other virgins , saying , Lord , Lord , open to us .
BRG	Matthew	25	12	But he answered and said , Verily I say unto you , I know you not .
BRG	Matthew	25	13	Watch therefore , for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh .
BRG	Matthew	25	14	For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country , who called his own servants , and delivered unto them his goods .
BRG	Matthew	25	15	And unto one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another one ; to every man according to his several ability ; and straightway took his journey .
BRG	Matthew	25	16	Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same , and made them other five talents .
BRG	Matthew	25	17	And likewise he that had received two , he also gained other two .
BRG	Matthew	25	18	But he that had received one went and digged in the earth , and hid his lord ’ s money .
BRG	Matthew	25	19	After a long time the lord of those servants cometh , and reckoneth with them .
BRG	Matthew	25	20	And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents , saying , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me five talents : behold , I have gained beside them five talents more .
BRG	Matthew	25	21	His lord said unto him , Well done , thou good and faithful servant : thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
BRG	Matthew	25	22	He also that had received two talents came and said , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me two talents : behold , I have gained two other talents beside them .
BRG	Matthew	25	23	His lord said unto him , Well done , good and faithful servant ; thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
BRG	Matthew	25	24	Then he which had received the one talent came and said , Lord , I knew thee that thou art an hard man , reaping where thou hast not sown , and gathering where thou hast not strawed :
BRG	Matthew	25	26	His lord answered and said unto him , Thou wicked and slothful servant , thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not , and gather where I have not strawed :
BRG	Matthew	25	27	Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers , and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury .
BRG	Matthew	25	28	Take therefore the talent from him , and give it unto him which hath ten talents .
BRG	Matthew	25	29	For unto every one that hath shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath .
BRG	Matthew	25	30	And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
BRG	Matthew	25	31	When the Son of man shall come in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory :
BRG	Matthew	25	32	And before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats :
BRG	Matthew	25	33	And he shall set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
BRG	Matthew	25	34	Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand , Come , ye blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world :
BRG	Matthew	25	35	For I was an hungred , and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : I was a stranger , and ye took me in :
BRG	Matthew	25	36	Naked , and ye clothed me : I was sick , and ye visited me : I was in prison , and ye came unto me .
BRG	Matthew	25	37	Then shall the righteous answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee an hungred , and fed thee ? or thirsty , and gave thee drink ?
BRG	Matthew	25	38	When saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ? or naked , and clothed thee ?
BRG	Matthew	25	39	Or when saw we thee sick , or in prison , and came unto thee ?
BRG	Matthew	25	40	And the King shall answer and say unto them , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it unto me .
BRG	Matthew	25	41	Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand , Depart from me , ye cursed , into everlasting fire , prepared for the devil and his angels :
BRG	Matthew	25	42	For I was an hungred , and ye gave me no meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me no drink :
BRG	Matthew	25	43	I was a stranger , and ye took me not in : naked , and ye clothed me not : sick , and in prison , and ye visited me not .
BRG	Matthew	25	44	Then shall they also answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee an hungred , or athirst , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and did not minister unto thee ?
BRG	Matthew	25	45	Then shall he answer them , saying , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these , ye did it not to me .

BRG	Matthew	26	26	And as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and blessed it , and brake it , and gave it to the disciples , and said , Take , eat ; this is my body .
BRG	Matthew	26	2	Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover , and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified .
BRG	Matthew	26	3	Then assembled together the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders of the people , unto the palace of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas ,
BRG	Matthew	26	4	And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty , and kill him .
BRG	Matthew	26	5	But they said , Not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar among the people .
BRG	Matthew	26	6	Now when Jesus was in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper ,
BRG	Matthew	26	7	There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment , and poured it on his head , as he sat at meat .
BRG	Matthew	26	8	But when his disciples saw it , they had indignation , saying , To what purpose is this waste ?
BRG	Matthew	26	9	For this ointment might have been sold for much , and given to the poor .
BRG	Matthew	26	10	When Jesus understood it , he said unto them , Why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me .
BRG	Matthew	26	11	For ye have the poor always with you ; but me ye have not always .
BRG	Matthew	26	12	For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body , she did it for my burial .
BRG	Matthew	26	13	Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , there shall also this , that this woman hath done , be told for a memorial of her .
BRG	Matthew	26	14	Then one of the twelve , called Judas Iscariot , went unto the chief priests ,
BRG	Matthew	26	15	And said unto them , What will ye give me , and I will deliver him unto you ? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver .
BRG	Matthew	26	16	And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him .
BRG	Matthew	26	17	Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus , saying unto him , Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover ?
BRG	Matthew	26	18	And he said , Go into the city to such a man , and say unto him , The Master saith , My time is at hand ; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples .
BRG	Matthew	26	19	And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them ; and they made ready the passover .
BRG	Matthew	26	20	Now when the even was come , he sat down with the twelve .
BRG	Matthew	26	21	And as they did eat , he said , Verily I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
BRG	Matthew	26	22	And they were exceeding sorrowful , and began every one of them to say unto him , Lord , is it I ?
BRG	Matthew	26	23	And he answered and said , He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish , the same shall betray me .
BRG	Matthew	26	24	The Son of man goeth as it is written of him : but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! it had been good for that man if he had not been born .
BRG	Matthew	26	25	Then Judas , which betrayed him , answered and said , Master , is it I ? He said unto him , Thou hast said .
BRG	Matthew	26	27	And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and gave it to them , saying , Drink ye all of it ;
BRG	Matthew	26	28	For this is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many for the remission of sins .
BRG	Matthew	26	29	But I say unto you , I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father ’ s kingdom .
BRG	Matthew	26	30	And when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of Olives .
BRG	Matthew	26	31	Then saith Jesus unto them , All ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad .
BRG	Matthew	26	32	But after I am risen again , I will go before you into Galilee .
BRG	Matthew	26	33	Peter answered and said unto him , Though all men shall be offended because of thee , yet will I never be offended .
BRG	Matthew	26	34	Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , That this night , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
BRG	Matthew	26	35	Peter said unto him , Though I should die with thee , yet will I not deny thee . Likewise also said all the disciples .
BRG	Matthew	26	36	Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane , and saith unto the disciples , Sit ye here , while I go and pray yonder .
BRG	Matthew	26	37	And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and very heavy .
BRG	Matthew	26	38	Then saith he unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful , even unto death : tarry ye here , and watch with me .
BRG	Matthew	26	39	And he went a little further , and fell on his face , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from me : nevertheless not as I will , but as thou wilt .
BRG	Matthew	26	40	And he cometh unto the disciples , and findeth them asleep , and saith unto Peter , What , could ye not watch with me one hour ?
BRG	Matthew	26	41	Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
BRG	Matthew	26	42	He went away again the second time , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if this cup may not pass away from me , except I drink it , thy will be done .
BRG	Matthew	26	43	And he came and found them asleep again : for their eyes were heavy .
BRG	Matthew	26	44	And he left them , and went away again , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
BRG	Matthew	26	45	Then cometh he to his disciples , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
BRG	Matthew	26	46	Rise , let us be going : behold , he is at hand that doth betray me .
BRG	Matthew	26	47	And while he yet spake , lo , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
BRG	Matthew	26	48	Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he : hold him fast .
BRG	Matthew	26	49	And forthwith he came to Jesus , and said , Hail , master ; and kissed him .
BRG	Matthew	26	50	And Jesus said unto him , Friend , wherefore art thou come ? Then came they , and laid hands on Jesus , and took him .
BRG	Matthew	26	51	And , behold , one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high priest ’ s , and smote off his ear .
BRG	Matthew	26	52	Then said Jesus unto him , Put up again thy sword into his place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword .
BRG	Matthew	26	53	Thinkest thou that I can not now pray to my Father , and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels ?
BRG	Matthew	26	54	But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled , that thus it must be ?
BRG	Matthew	26	55	In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes , Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me ? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple , and ye laid no hold on me .
BRG	Matthew	26	56	But all this was done , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the disciples forsook him , and fled .
BRG	Matthew	26	57	And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were assembled .
BRG	Matthew	26	58	But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest ’ s palace , and went in , and sat with the servants , to see the end .
BRG	Matthew	26	59	Now the chief priests , and elders , and all the council , sought false witness against Jesus , to put him to death ;
BRG	Matthew	26	60	But found none : yea , though many false witnesses came , yet found they none . At the last came two false witnesses ,
BRG	Matthew	26	61	And said , This fellow said , I am able to destroy the temple of God , and to build it in three days .
BRG	Matthew	26	62	And the high priest arose , and said unto him , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
BRG	Matthew	26	63	But Jesus held his peace . And the high priest answered and said unto him , I adjure thee by the living God , that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ , the Son of God .
BRG	Matthew	26	64	Jesus saith unto him , Thou hast said : nevertheless I say unto you , Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven .
BRG	Matthew	26	65	Then the high priest rent his clothes , saying , He hath spoken blasphemy ; what further need have we of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard his blasphemy .
BRG	Matthew	26	66	What think ye ? They answered and said , He is guilty of death .
BRG	Matthew	26	67	Then did they spit in his face , and buffeted him ; and others smote him with the palms of their hands ,
BRG	Matthew	26	68	Saying , Prophesy unto us , thou Christ , Who is he that smote thee ?
BRG	Matthew	26	69	Now Peter sat without in the palace : and a damsel came unto him , saying , Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee .
BRG	Matthew	26	70	But he denied before them all , saying , I know not what thou sayest .
BRG	Matthew	26	71	And when he was gone out into the porch , another maid saw him , and said unto them that were there , This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth .
BRG	Matthew	26	72	And again he denied with an oath , I do not know the man .
BRG	Matthew	26	73	And after a while came unto him they that stood by , and said to Peter , Surely thou also art one of them ; for thy speech bewrayeth thee .
BRG	Matthew	26	74	Then began he to curse and to swear , saying , I know not the man . And immediately the cock crew .
BRG	Matthew	26	75	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus , which said unto him , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . And he went out , and wept bitterly . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Matthew	27	27	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall , and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers .
BRG	Matthew	27	2	And when they had bound him , they led him away , and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor .
BRG	Matthew	27	3	Then Judas , which had betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , repented himself , and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
BRG	Matthew	27	4	Saying , I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood . And they said , What is that to us ? see thou to that .
BRG	Matthew	27	5	And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple , and departed , and went and hanged himself .
BRG	Matthew	27	6	And the chief priests took the silver pieces , and said , It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury , because it is the price of blood .
BRG	Matthew	27	7	And they took counsel , and bought with them the potter ’ s field , to bury strangers in .
BRG	Matthew	27	8	Wherefore that field was called , The field of blood , unto this day .
BRG	Matthew	27	9	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet , saying , And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him that was valued , whom they of the children of Israel did value ;
BRG	Matthew	27	10	And gave them for the potter ’ s field , as the Lord appointed me .
BRG	Matthew	27	11	And Jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And Jesus said unto him , Thou sayest .
BRG	Matthew	27	12	And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .
BRG	Matthew	27	13	Then said Pilate unto him , Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee ?
BRG	Matthew	27	14	And he answered him to never a word ; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly .
BRG	Matthew	27	15	Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner , whom they would .
BRG	Matthew	27	16	And they had then a notable prisoner , called Barabbas .
BRG	Matthew	27	17	Therefore when they were gathered together , Pilate said unto them , Whom will ye that I release unto you ? Barabbas , or Jesus which is called Christ ?
BRG	Matthew	27	18	For he knew that for envy they had delivered him .
BRG	Matthew	27	19	When he was set down on the judgment seat , his wife sent unto him , saying , Have thou nothing to do with that just man : for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him .
BRG	Matthew	27	20	But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas , and destroy Jesus .
BRG	Matthew	27	21	The governor answered and said unto them , Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you ? They said , Barabbas .
BRG	Matthew	27	22	Pilate saith unto them , What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ ? They all say unto him , Let him be crucified .
BRG	Matthew	27	23	And the governor said , Why , what evil hath he done ? But they cried out the more , saying , Let him be crucified .
BRG	Matthew	27	24	When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing , but that rather a tumult was made , he took water , and washed his hands before the multitude , saying , I am innocent of the blood of this just person : see ye to it .
BRG	Matthew	27	25	Then answered all the people , and said , His blood be on us , and on our children .
BRG	Matthew	27	26	Then released he Barabbas unto them : and when he had scourged Jesus , he delivered him to be crucified .
BRG	Matthew	27	28	And they stripped him , and put on him a scarlet robe .
BRG	Matthew	27	29	And when they had platted a crown of thorns , they put it upon his head , and a reed in his right hand : and they bowed the knee before him , and mocked him , saying , Hail , King of the Jews !
BRG	Matthew	27	30	And they spit upon him , and took the reed , and smote him on the head .
BRG	Matthew	27	31	And after that they had mocked him , they took the robe off from him , and put his own raiment on him , and led him away to crucify him .
BRG	Matthew	27	32	And as they came out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name : him they compelled to bear his cross .
BRG	Matthew	27	33	And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha , that is to say , a place of a skull ,
BRG	Matthew	27	34	They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall : and when he had tasted thereof , he would not drink .
BRG	Matthew	27	35	And they crucified him , and parted his garments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , They parted my garments among them , and upon my vesture did they cast lots .
BRG	Matthew	27	36	And sitting down they watched him there ;
BRG	Matthew	27	37	And set up over his head his accusation written , This Is Jesus the King of the Jews .
BRG	Matthew	27	38	Then were there two thieves crucified with him , one on the right hand , and another on the left .
BRG	Matthew	27	39	And they that passed by reviled him , wagging their heads ,
BRG	Matthew	27	40	And saying , Thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days , save thyself . If thou be the Son of God , come down from the cross .
BRG	Matthew	27	41	Likewise also the chief priests mocking him , with the scribes and elders , said ,
BRG	Matthew	27	42	He saved others ; himself he can not save . If he be the King of Israel , let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe him .
BRG	Matthew	27	43	He trusted in God ; let him deliver him now , if he will have him : for he said , I am the Son of God .
BRG	Matthew	27	44	The thieves also , which were crucified with him , cast the same in his teeth .
BRG	Matthew	27	45	Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour .
BRG	Matthew	27	46	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? that is to say , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ?
BRG	Matthew	27	47	Some of them that stood there , when they heard that , said , This man calleth for Elias .
BRG	Matthew	27	48	And straightway one of them ran , and took a spunge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink .
BRG	Matthew	27	49	The rest said , Let be , let us see whether Elias will come to save him .
BRG	Matthew	27	50	Jesus , when he had cried again with a loud voice , yielded up the ghost .
BRG	Matthew	27	51	And , behold , the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom ; and the earth did quake , and the rocks rent ;
BRG	Matthew	27	52	And the graves were opened ; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose ,
BRG	Matthew	27	53	And came out of the graves after his resurrection , and went into the holy city , and appeared unto many .
BRG	Matthew	27	54	Now when the centurion , and they that were with him , watching Jesus , saw the earthquake , and those things that were done , they feared greatly , saying , Truly this was the Son of God .
BRG	Matthew	27	55	And many women were there beholding afar off , which followed Jesus from Galilee , ministering unto him :
BRG	Matthew	27	56	Among which was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of Zebedee ’ s children .
BRG	Matthew	27	57	When the even was come , there came a rich man of Arimathaea , named Joseph , who also himself was Jesus ’ disciple :
BRG	Matthew	27	58	He went to Pilate , and begged the body of Jesus . Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered .
BRG	Matthew	27	59	And when Joseph had taken the body , he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
BRG	Matthew	27	60	And laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out in the rock : and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre , and departed .
BRG	Matthew	27	61	And there was Mary Magdalene , and the other Mary , sitting over against the sepulchre .
BRG	Matthew	27	62	Now the next day , that followed the day of the preparation , the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate ,
BRG	Matthew	27	63	Saying , Sir , we remember that that deceiver said , while he was yet alive , After three days I will rise again .
BRG	Matthew	27	64	Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day , lest his disciples come by night , and steal him away , and say unto the people , He is risen from the dead : so the last error shall be worse than the first .
BRG	Matthew	27	65	Pilate said unto them , Ye have a watch : go your way , make it as sure as ye can .
BRG	Matthew	27	66	So they went , and made the sepulchre sure , sealing the stone , and setting a watch . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Matthew	28	28	In the end of the sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week , came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre .
BRG	Matthew	28	2	And , behold , there was a great earthquake : for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it .
BRG	Matthew	28	3	His countenance was like lightning , and his raiment white as snow :
BRG	Matthew	28	4	And for fear of him the keepers did shake , and became as dead men .
BRG	Matthew	28	5	And the angel answered and said unto the women , Fear not ye : for I know that ye seek Jesus , which was crucified .
BRG	Matthew	28	6	He is not here : for he is risen , as he said . Come , see the place where the Lord lay .
BRG	Matthew	28	7	And go quickly , and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead ; and , behold , he goeth before you into Galilee ; there shall ye see him : lo , I have told you .
BRG	Matthew	28	8	And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy ; and did run to bring his disciples word .
BRG	Matthew	28	9	And as they went to tell his disciples , behold , Jesus met them , saying , All hail . And they came and held him by the feet , and worshipped him .
BRG	Matthew	28	10	Then said Jesus unto them , Be not afraid : go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee , and there shall they see me .
BRG	Matthew	28	11	Now when they were going , behold , some of the watch came into the city , and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done .
BRG	Matthew	28	12	And when they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave large money unto the soldiers ,
BRG	Matthew	28	13	Saying , Say ye , His disciples came by night , and stole him away while we slept .
BRG	Matthew	28	14	And if this come to the governor ’ s ears , we will persuade him , and secure you .
BRG	Matthew	28	15	So they took the money , and did as they were taught : and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day .
BRG	Matthew	28	16	Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee , into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them .
BRG	Matthew	28	17	And when they saw him , they worshipped him : but some doubted .
BRG	Matthew	28	18	And Jesus came and spake unto them , saying , All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth .
BRG	Matthew	28	19	Go ye therefore , and teach all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost :
BRG	Matthew	28	20	Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you : and , lo , I am with you alway , even unto the end of the world . Amen . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Matthew	28	4145648	""
BRG	Mark	1	1	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God ;
BRG	Mark	1	2	As it is written in the prophets , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee . ( A )
BRG	Mark	1	3	The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight . ( B )
BRG	Mark	1	4	John did baptize in the wilderness , and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins .
BRG	Mark	1	5	And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea , and they of Jerusalem , and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan , confessing their sins .
BRG	Mark	1	6	And John was clothed with camel ’ s hair , and with a girdle of a skin about his loins ; and he did eat locusts and wild honey ;
BRG	Mark	1	7	And preached , saying , There cometh one mightier than I after me , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose .
BRG	Mark	1	8	I indeed have baptized you with water : but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost .
BRG	Mark	1	9	And it came to pass in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized of John in Jordan .
BRG	Mark	1	10	And straightway coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens opened , and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him :
BRG	Mark	1	11	And there came a voice from heaven , saying , Thou art my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
BRG	Mark	1	12	And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness .
BRG	Mark	1	13	And he was there in the wilderness forty days , tempted of Satan ; and was with the wild beasts ; and the angels ministered unto him .
BRG	Mark	1	14	Now after that John was put in prison , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God ,
BRG	Mark	1	15	And saying , The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand : repent ye , and believe the gospel .
BRG	Mark	1	16	Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
BRG	Mark	1	17	And Jesus said unto them , Come ye after me , and I will make you to become fishers of men .
BRG	Mark	1	18	And straightway they forsook their nets , and followed him .
BRG	Mark	1	19	And when he had gone a little further thence , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who also were in the ship mending their nets .
BRG	Mark	1	20	And straightway he called them : and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants , and went after him .
BRG	Mark	1	21	And they went into Capernaum ; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue , and taught .
BRG	Mark	1	22	And they were astonished at his doctrine : for he taught them as one that had authority , and not as the scribes .
BRG	Mark	1	23	And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
BRG	Mark	1	24	Saying , Let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the Holy One of God .
BRG	Mark	1	25	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him .
BRG	Mark	1	26	And when the unclean spirit had torn him , and cried with a loud voice , he came out of him .
BRG	Mark	1	27	And they were all amazed , insomuch that they questioned among themselves , saying , What thing is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits , and they do obey him .
BRG	Mark	1	28	And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee .
BRG	Mark	1	29	And forthwith , when they were come out of the synagogue , they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
BRG	Mark	1	30	But Simon ’ s wife ’ s mother lay sick of a fever , and anon they tell him of her .
BRG	Mark	1	31	And he came and took her by the hand , and lifted her up ; and immediately the fever left her , and she ministered unto them .
BRG	Mark	1	32	And at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were diseased , and them that were possessed with devils .
BRG	Mark	1	33	And all the city was gathered together at the door .
BRG	Mark	1	34	And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases , and cast out many devils ; and suffered not the devils to speak , because they knew him .
BRG	Mark	1	35	And in the morning , rising up a great while before day , he went out , and departed into a solitary place , and there prayed .
BRG	Mark	1	36	And Simon and they that were with him followed after him .
BRG	Mark	1	37	And when they had found him , they said unto him , All men seek for thee .
BRG	Mark	1	38	And he said unto them , Let us go into the next towns , that I may preach there also : for therefore came I forth .
BRG	Mark	1	39	And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee , and cast out devils .
BRG	Mark	1	40	And there came a leper to him , beseeching him , and kneeling down to him , and saying unto him , If thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
BRG	Mark	1	41	And Jesus , moved with compassion , put forth his hand , and touched him , and saith unto him , I will ; be thou clean .
BRG	Mark	1	42	And as soon as he had spoken , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was cleansed .
BRG	Mark	1	43	And he straitly charged him , and forthwith sent him away ;
BRG	Mark	1	44	And saith unto him , See thou say nothing to any man : but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
BRG	Mark	1	45	But he went out , and began to publish it much , and to blaze abroad the matter , insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city , but was without in desert places : and they came to him from every quarter . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Mark	2	2	And straightway many were gathered together , insomuch that there was no room to receive them , no , not so much as about the door : and he preached the word unto them .
BRG	Mark	2	3	And they come unto him , bringing one sick of the palsy , which was borne of four .
BRG	Mark	2	4	And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press , they uncovered the roof where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay .
BRG	Mark	2	5	When Jesus saw their faith , he said unto the sick of the palsy , Son , thy sins be forgiven thee .
BRG	Mark	2	6	But there were certain of the scribes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts ,
BRG	Mark	2	7	Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies ? who can forgive sins but God only ?
BRG	Mark	2	8	And immediately when Jesus perceived in his Spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , he said unto them , Why reason ye these things in your hearts ?
BRG	Mark	2	9	Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Arise , and take up thy bed , and walk ?
BRG	Mark	2	10	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( he saith to the sick of the palsy , )
BRG	Mark	2	11	I say unto thee , Arise , and take up thy bed , and go thy way into thine house .
BRG	Mark	2	12	And immediately he arose , took up the bed , and went forth before them all ; insomuch that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , We never saw it on this fashion .
BRG	Mark	2	13	And he went forth again by the sea side ; and all the multitude resorted unto him , and he taught them .
BRG	Mark	2	14	And as he passed by , he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom , and said unto him , Follow me . And he arose and followed him .
BRG	Mark	2	15	And it came to pass , that , as Jesus sat at meat in his house , many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him .
BRG	Mark	2	16	And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners , they said unto his disciples , How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners ?
BRG	Mark	2	17	When Jesus heard it , he saith unto them , They that are whole have no need of the physician , but they that are sick : I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
BRG	Mark	2	18	And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast : and they come and say unto him , Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast , but thy disciples fast not ?
BRG	Mark	2	19	And Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they can not fast .
BRG	Mark	2	20	But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
BRG	Mark	2	21	No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment : else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old , and the rent is made worse .
BRG	Mark	2	22	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles : else the new wine doth burst the bottles , and the wine is spilled , and the bottles will be marred : but new wine must be put into new bottles .
BRG	Mark	2	23	And it came to pass , that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day ; and his disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears of corn .
BRG	Mark	2	24	And the Pharisees said unto him , Behold , why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful ?
BRG	Mark	2	25	And he said unto them , Have ye never read what David did , when he had need , and was an hungred , he , and they that were with him ?
BRG	Mark	2	26	How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest , and did eat the shewbread , which is not lawful to eat but for the priests , and gave also to them which were with him ?

BRG	Mark	3	3	And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand , Stand forth .
BRG	Mark	3	2	And they watched him , whether he would heal him on the sabbath day ; that they might accuse him .
BRG	Mark	3	4	And he saith unto them , Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days , or to do evil ? to save life , or to kill ? But they held their peace .
BRG	Mark	3	5	And when he had looked round about on them with anger , being grieved for the hardness of their hearts , he saith unto the man , Stretch forth thine hand . And he stretched it out : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
BRG	Mark	3	6	And the Pharisees went forth , and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him , how they might destroy him .
BRG	Mark	3	7	But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea : and a great multitude from Galilee followed him , and from Judaea ,
BRG	Mark	3	8	And from Jerusalem , and from Idumaea , and from beyond Jordan ; and they about Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , when they had heard what great things he did , came unto him .
BRG	Mark	3	9	And he spake to his disciples , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude , lest they should throng him .

BRG	Mark	3	21	And when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is beside himself .
BRG	Mark	3	22	And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said , He hath Beelzebub , and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils .

BRG	Mark	4	4	And it came to pass , as he sowed , some fell by the way side , and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up .
BRG	Mark	4	2	And he taught them many things by parables , and said unto them in his doctrine ,
BRG	Mark	4	3	Hearken ; Behold , there went out a sower to sow :
BRG	Mark	4	5	And some fell on stony ground , where it had not much earth ; and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of earth :
BRG	Mark	4	6	But when the sun was up , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
BRG	Mark	4	7	And some fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up , and choked it , and it yielded no fruit .
BRG	Mark	4	8	And other fell on good ground , and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased ; and brought forth , some thirty , and some sixty , and some an hundred .
BRG	Mark	4	9	And he said unto them , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
BRG	Mark	4	10	And when he was alone , they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable .
BRG	Mark	4	11	And he said unto them , Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God : but unto them that are without , all these things are done in parables :
BRG	Mark	4	12	That seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest at any time they should be converted , and their sins should be forgiven them .
BRG	Mark	4	13	And he said unto them , Know ye not this parable ? and how then will ye know all parables ?
BRG	Mark	4	14	The sower soweth the word .
BRG	Mark	4	15	And these are they by the way side , where the word is sown ; but when they have heard , Satan cometh immediately , and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts .
BRG	Mark	4	16	And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground ; who , when they have heard the word , immediately receive it with gladness ;
BRG	Mark	4	17	And have no root in themselves , and so endure but for a time : afterward , when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word ’ s sake , immediately they are offended .
BRG	Mark	4	18	And these are they which are sown among thorns ; such as hear the word ,
BRG	Mark	4	19	And the cares of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts of other things entering in , choke the word , and it becometh unfruitful .
BRG	Mark	4	20	And these are they which are sown on good ground ; such as hear the word , and receive it , and bring forth fruit , some thirtyfold , some sixty , and some an hundred .
BRG	Mark	4	21	And he said unto them , Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel , or under a bed ? and not to be set on a candlestick ?
BRG	Mark	4	22	For there is nothing hid , which shall not be manifested ; neither was any thing kept secret , but that it should come abroad .
BRG	Mark	4	23	If any man have ears to hear , let him hear .
BRG	Mark	4	24	And he said unto them , Take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you : and unto you that hear shall more be given .

BRG	Mark	4	27	And should sleep , and rise night and day , and the seed should spring and grow up , he knoweth not how .
BRG	Mark	4	28	For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself ; first the blade , then the ear , after that the full corn in the ear .
BRG	Mark	4	29	But when the fruit is brought forth , immediately he putteth in the sickle , because the harvest is come .
BRG	Mark	4	30	And he said , Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God ? or with what comparison shall we compare it ?
BRG	Mark	4	31	It is like a grain of mustard seed , which , when it is sown in the earth , is less than all the seeds that be in the earth :
BRG	Mark	4	32	But when it is sown , it groweth up , and becometh greater than all herbs , and shooteth out great branches ; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it .
BRG	Mark	4	33	And with many such parables spake he the word unto them , as they were able to hear it .
BRG	Mark	4	34	But without a parable spake he not unto them : and when they were alone , he expounded all things to his disciples .
BRG	Mark	4	35	And the same day , when the even was come , he saith unto them , Let us pass over unto the other side .
BRG	Mark	4	36	And when they had sent away the multitude , they took him even as he was in the ship . And there were also with him other little ships .
BRG	Mark	4	37	And there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it was now full .
BRG	Mark	4	38	And he was in the hinder part of the ship , asleep on a pillow : and they awake him , and say unto him , Master , carest thou not that we perish ?
BRG	Mark	4	39	And he arose , and rebuked the wind , and said unto the sea , Peace , be still . And the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
BRG	Mark	4	40	And he said unto them , Why are ye so fearful ? how is it that ye have no faith ?
BRG	Mark	4	41	And they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , What manner of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Mark	4	4145648	""
BRG	Mark	5	5	And always , night and day , he was in the mountains , and in the tombs , crying , and cutting himself with stones .
BRG	Mark	5	2	And when he was come out of the ship , immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
BRG	Mark	5	3	Who had his dwelling among the tombs ; and no man could bind him , no , not with chains :
BRG	Mark	5	4	Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been plucked asunder by him , and the fetters broken in pieces : neither could any man tame him .
BRG	Mark	5	6	But when he saw Jesus afar off , he ran and worshipped him ,
BRG	Mark	5	7	And cried with a loud voice , and said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of the most high God ? I adjure thee by God , that thou torment me not .
BRG	Mark	5	8	For he said unto him , Come out of the man , thou unclean spirit .
BRG	Mark	5	9	And he asked him , What is thy name ? And he answered , saying , My name is Legion : for we are many .
BRG	Mark	5	10	And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country .
BRG	Mark	5	11	Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding .
BRG	Mark	5	12	And all the devils besought him , saying , Send us into the swine , that we may enter into them .
BRG	Mark	5	13	And forthwith Jesus gave them leave . And the unclean spirits went out , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea , ( they were about two thousand ; ) and were choked in the sea .
BRG	Mark	5	14	And they that fed the swine fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . And they went out to see what it was that was done .
BRG	Mark	5	15	And they come to Jesus , and see him that was possessed with the devil , and had the legion , sitting , and clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
BRG	Mark	5	16	And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil , and also concerning the swine .
BRG	Mark	5	17	And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts .
BRG	Mark	5	18	And when he was come into the ship , he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him .
BRG	Mark	5	19	Howbeit Jesus suffered him not , but saith unto him , Go home to thy friends , and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee , and hath had compassion on thee .
BRG	Mark	5	20	And he departed , and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him : and all men did marvel .
BRG	Mark	5	21	And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side , much people gathered unto him : and he was nigh unto the sea .
BRG	Mark	5	22	And , behold , there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue , Jairus by name ; and when he saw him , he fell at his feet ,
BRG	Mark	5	23	And besought him greatly , saying , My little daughter lieth at the point of death : I pray thee , come and lay thy hands on her , that she may be healed ; and she shall live .
BRG	Mark	5	24	And Jesus went with him ; and much people followed him , and thronged him .
BRG	Mark	5	25	And a certain woman , which had an issue of blood twelve years ,
BRG	Mark	5	26	And had suffered many things of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bettered , but rather grew worse ,
BRG	Mark	5	27	When she had heard of Jesus , came in the press behind , and touched his garment .
BRG	Mark	5	28	For she said , If I may touch but his clothes , I shall be whole .
BRG	Mark	5	29	And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague .
BRG	Mark	5	30	And Jesus , immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him , turned him about in the press , and said , Who touched my clothes ?
BRG	Mark	5	31	And his disciples said unto him , Thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ?
BRG	Mark	5	32	And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing .
BRG	Mark	5	33	But the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what was done in her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
BRG	Mark	5	34	And he said unto her , Daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace , and be whole of thy plague .
BRG	Mark	5	35	While he yet spake , there came from the ruler of the synagogue ’ s house certain which said , Thy daughter is dead : why troublest thou the Master any further ?
BRG	Mark	5	36	As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken , he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue , Be not afraid , only believe .
BRG	Mark	5	37	And he suffered no man to follow him , save Peter , and James , and John the brother of James .
BRG	Mark	5	38	And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and seeth the tumult , and them that wept and wailed greatly .
BRG	Mark	5	39	And when he was come in , he saith unto them , Why make ye this ado , and weep ? the damsel is not dead , but sleepeth .
BRG	Mark	5	40	And they laughed him to scorn . But when he had put them all out , he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel , and them that were with him , and entereth in where the damsel was lying .
BRG	Mark	5	41	And he took the damsel by the hand , and said unto her , Talitha cumi ; which is , being interpreted , Damsel , I say unto thee , arise .
BRG	Mark	5	42	And straightway the damsel arose , and walked ; for she was of the age of twelve years . And they were astonished with a great astonishment .
BRG	Mark	5	43	And he charged them straitly that no man should know it ; and commanded that something should be given her to eat . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Mark	6	6	And he marvelled because of their unbelief . And he went round about the villages , teaching .
BRG	Mark	6	2	And when the sabbath day was come , he began to teach in the synagogue : and many hearing him were astonished , saying , From whence hath this man these things ? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him , that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands ?
BRG	Mark	6	3	Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary , the brother of James , and Joses , and of Juda , and Simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? And they were offended at him .
BRG	Mark	6	4	But Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honour , but in his own country , and among his own kin , and in his own house .
BRG	Mark	6	5	And he could there do no mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them .
BRG	Mark	6	7	And he called unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and gave them power over unclean spirits ;
BRG	Mark	6	8	And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey , save a staff only ; no scrip , no bread , no money in their purse :
BRG	Mark	6	9	But be shod with sandals ; and not put on two coats .
BRG	Mark	6	10	And he said unto them , In what place soever ye enter into an house , there abide till ye depart from that place .
BRG	Mark	6	11	And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear you , when ye depart thence , shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them . Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
BRG	Mark	6	12	And they went out , and preached that men should repent .
BRG	Mark	6	13	And they cast out many devils , and anointed with oil many that were sick , and healed them .
BRG	Mark	6	14	And king Herod heard of him ; ( for his name was spread abroad : ) and he said , That John the Baptist was risen from the dead , and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
BRG	Mark	6	15	Others said , That it is Elias . And others said , That it is a prophet , or as one of the prophets .
BRG	Mark	6	16	But when Herod heard thereof , he said , It is John , whom I beheaded : he is risen from the dead .
BRG	Mark	6	17	For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John , and bound him in prison for Herodias ’ sake , his brother Philip ’ s wife : for he had married her .
BRG	Mark	6	18	For John had said unto Herod , It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother ’ s wife .
BRG	Mark	6	19	Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him , and would have killed him ; but she could not :
BRG	Mark	6	20	For Herod feared John , knowing that he was a just man and an holy , and observed him ; and when he heard him , he did many things , and heard him gladly .
BRG	Mark	6	21	And when a convenient day was come , that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords , high captains , and chief estates of Galilee ;
BRG	Mark	6	22	And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in , and danced , and pleased Herod and them that sat with him , the king said unto the damsel , Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt , and I will give it thee .
BRG	Mark	6	23	And he sware unto her , Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , I will give it thee , unto the half of my kingdom .
BRG	Mark	6	24	And she went forth , and said unto her mother , What shall I ask ? And she said , The head of John the Baptist .
BRG	Mark	6	25	And she came in straightway with haste unto the king , and asked , saying , I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist .
BRG	Mark	6	26	And the king was exceeding sorry ; yet for his oath ’ s sake , and for their sakes which sat with him , he would not reject her .
BRG	Mark	6	27	And immediately the king sent an executioner , and commanded his head to be brought : and he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
BRG	Mark	6	28	And brought his head in a charger , and gave it to the damsel : and the damsel gave it to her mother .
BRG	Mark	6	29	And when his disciples heard of it , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
BRG	Mark	6	30	And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught .
BRG	Mark	6	31	And he said unto them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while : for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
BRG	Mark	6	32	And they departed into a desert place by ship privately .
BRG	Mark	6	33	And the people saw them departing , and many knew him , and ran afoot thither out of all cities , and outwent them , and came together unto him .
BRG	Mark	6	34	And Jesus , when he came out , saw much people , and was moved with compassion toward them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd : and he began to teach them many things .
BRG	Mark	6	35	And when the day was now far spent , his disciples came unto him , and said , This is a desert place , and now the time is far passed :
BRG	Mark	6	36	Send them away , that they may go into the country round about , and into the villages , and buy themselves bread : for they have nothing to eat .
BRG	Mark	6	37	He answered and said unto them , Give ye them to eat . And they say unto him , Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread , and give them to eat ?
BRG	Mark	6	38	He saith unto them , How many loaves have ye ? go and see . And when they knew , they say , Five , and two fishes .
BRG	Mark	6	39	And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass .
BRG	Mark	6	40	And they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fifties .
BRG	Mark	6	41	And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed , and brake the loaves , and gave them to his disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes divided he among them all .
BRG	Mark	6	42	And they did all eat , and were filled .
BRG	Mark	6	43	And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments , and of the fishes .
BRG	Mark	6	44	And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men .
BRG	Mark	6	45	And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship , and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida , while he sent away the people .
BRG	Mark	6	46	And when he had sent them away , he departed into a mountain to pray .
BRG	Mark	6	47	And when even was come , the ship was in the midst of the sea , and he alone on the land .
BRG	Mark	6	48	And he saw them toiling in rowing ; for the wind was contrary unto them : and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them , walking upon the sea , and would have passed by them .
BRG	Mark	6	49	But when they saw him walking upon the sea , they supposed it had been a spirit , and cried out :
BRG	Mark	6	50	For they all saw him , and were troubled . And immediately he talked with them , and saith unto them , Be of good cheer : it is I ; be not afraid .
BRG	Mark	6	51	And he went up unto them into the ship ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure , and wondered .
BRG	Mark	6	52	For they considered not the miracle of the loaves : for their heart was hardened .
BRG	Mark	6	53	And when they had passed over , they came into the land of Gennesaret , and drew to the shore .
BRG	Mark	6	54	And when they were come out of the ship , straightway they knew him ,
BRG	Mark	6	55	And ran through that whole region round about , and began to carry about in beds those that were sick , where they heard he was .
BRG	Mark	6	56	And whithersoever he entered , into villages , or cities , or country , they laid the sick in the streets , and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment : and as many as touched him were made whole . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Mark	7	7	Howbeit in vain do they worship me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men .
BRG	Mark	7	2	And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled , that is to say , with unwashen , hands , they found fault .
BRG	Mark	7	3	For the Pharisees , and all the Jews , except they wash their hands oft , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders .
BRG	Mark	7	4	And when they come from the market , except they wash , they eat not . And many other things there be , which they have received to hold , as the washing of cups , and pots , brasen vessels , and of tables .
BRG	Mark	7	5	Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him , Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders , but eat bread with unwashen hands ?
BRG	Mark	7	6	He answered and said unto them , Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites , as it is written , This people honoureth me with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
BRG	Mark	7	8	For laying aside the commandment of God , ye hold the tradition of men , as the washing of pots and cups : and many other such like things ye do .
BRG	Mark	7	9	And he said unto them , Full well ye reject the commandment of God , that ye may keep your own tradition .
BRG	Mark	7	10	For Moses said , Honour thy father and thy mother ; and , Whoso curseth father or mother , let him die the death :
BRG	Mark	7	11	But ye say , If a man shall say to his father or mother , It is Corban , that is to say , a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me ; he shall be free .
BRG	Mark	7	12	And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother ;
BRG	Mark	7	13	Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition , which ye have delivered : and many such like things do ye .
BRG	Mark	7	14	And when he had called all the people unto him , he said unto them , Hearken unto me every one of you , and understand :
BRG	Mark	7	15	There is nothing from without a man , that entering into him can defile him : but the things which come out of him , those are they that defile the man .
BRG	Mark	7	16	If any man have ears to hear , let him hear .
BRG	Mark	7	17	And when he was entered into the house from the people , his disciples asked him concerning the parable .
BRG	Mark	7	18	And he saith unto them , Are ye so without understanding also ? Do ye not perceive , that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man , it can not defile him ;
BRG	Mark	7	19	Because it entereth not into his heart , but into the belly , and goeth out into the draught , purging all meats ?
BRG	Mark	7	20	And he said , That which cometh out of the man , that defileth the man .
BRG	Mark	7	21	For from within , out of the heart of men , proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders ,
BRG	Mark	7	22	Thefts , covetousness , wickedness , deceit , lasciviousness , an evil eye , blasphemy , pride , foolishness :
BRG	Mark	7	23	All these evil things come from within , and defile the man .
BRG	Mark	7	24	And from thence he arose , and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and entered into an house , and would have no man know it : but he could not be hid .
BRG	Mark	7	25	For a certain woman , whose young daughter had an unclean spirit , heard of him , and came and fell at his feet :
BRG	Mark	7	26	The woman was a Greek , a Syrophenician by nation ; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter .
BRG	Mark	7	27	But Jesus said unto her , Let the children first be filled : for it is not meet to take the children ’ s bread , and to cast it unto the dogs .
BRG	Mark	7	28	And she answered and said unto him , Yes , Lord : yet the dogs under the table eat of the children ’ s crumbs .
BRG	Mark	7	29	And he said unto her , For this saying go thy way ; the devil is gone out of thy daughter .
BRG	Mark	7	30	And when she was come to her house , she found the devil gone out , and her daughter laid upon the bed .
BRG	Mark	7	31	And again , departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon , he came unto the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis .
BRG	Mark	7	32	And they bring unto him one that was deaf , and had an impediment in his speech ; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him .
BRG	Mark	7	33	And he took him aside from the multitude , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spit , and touched his tongue ;
BRG	Mark	7	34	And looking up to heaven , he sighed , and saith unto him , Ephphatha , that is , Be opened .
BRG	Mark	7	35	And straightway his ears were opened , and the string of his tongue was loosed , and he spake plain .
BRG	Mark	7	36	And he charged them that they should tell no man : but the more he charged them , so much the more a great deal they published it ;
BRG	Mark	7	37	And were beyond measure astonished , saying , He hath done all things well : he maketh both the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Mark	8	8	So they did eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets .
BRG	Mark	8	2	I have compassion on the multitude , because they have now been with me three days , and have nothing to eat :
BRG	Mark	8	3	And if I send them away fasting to their own houses , they will faint by the way : for divers of them came from far .
BRG	Mark	8	4	And his disciples answered him , From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness ?
BRG	Mark	8	5	And he asked them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven .
BRG	Mark	8	6	And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven loaves , and gave thanks , and brake , and gave to his disciples to set before them ; and they did set them before the people .
BRG	Mark	8	7	And they had a few small fishes : and he blessed , and commanded to set them also before them .
BRG	Mark	8	9	And they that had eaten were about four thousand : and he sent them away .
BRG	Mark	8	10	And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples , and came into the parts of Dalmanutha .
BRG	Mark	8	11	And the Pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heaven , tempting him .
BRG	Mark	8	12	And he sighed deeply in his Spirit , and saith , Why doth this generation seek after a sign ? verily I say unto you , There shall no sign be given unto this generation .
BRG	Mark	8	13	And he left them , and entering into the ship again departed to the other side .
BRG	Mark	8	14	Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread , neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf .
BRG	Mark	8	15	And he charged them , saying , Take heed , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , and of the leaven of Herod .
BRG	Mark	8	16	And they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have no bread .
BRG	Mark	8	17	And when Jesus knew it , he saith unto them , Why reason ye , because ye have no bread ? perceive ye not yet , neither understand ? have ye your heart yet hardened ?
BRG	Mark	8	18	Having eyes , see ye not ? and having ears , hear ye not ? and do ye not remember ?
BRG	Mark	8	19	When I brake the five loaves among five thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? They say unto him , Twelve .
BRG	Mark	8	20	And when the seven among four thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? And they said , Seven .
BRG	Mark	8	21	And he said unto them , How is it that ye do not understand ?
BRG	Mark	8	22	And he cometh to Bethsaida ; and they bring a blind man unto him , and besought him to touch him .
BRG	Mark	8	23	And he took the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had spit on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw ought .
BRG	Mark	8	24	And he looked up , and said , I see men as trees , walking .
BRG	Mark	8	25	After that he put his hands again upon his eyes , and made him look up : and he was restored , and saw every man clearly .
BRG	Mark	8	26	And he sent him away to his house , saying , Neither go into the town , nor tell it to any in the town .
BRG	Mark	8	27	And Jesus went out , and his disciples , into the towns of Caesarea Philippi : and by the way he asked his disciples , saying unto them , Whom do men say that I am ?
BRG	Mark	8	28	And they answered , John the Baptist : but some say , Elias ; and others , One of the prophets .
BRG	Mark	8	29	And he saith unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? And Peter answereth and saith unto him , Thou art the Christ .
BRG	Mark	8	30	And he charged them that they should tell no man of him .
BRG	Mark	8	31	And he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders , and of the chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .

BRG	Mark	9	4	And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses : and they were talking with Jesus .
BRG	Mark	9	5	And Peter answered and said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias .
BRG	Mark	9	6	For he wist not what to say ; for they were sore afraid .
BRG	Mark	9	7	And there was a cloud that overshadowed them : and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him .

BRG	Mark	9	18	And wheresoever he taketh him , he teareth him : and he foameth , and gnasheth with his teeth , and pineth away : and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out ; and they could not .
BRG	Mark	9	19	He answereth him , and saith , O faithless generation , how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I suffer you ? bring him unto me .
BRG	Mark	9	20	And they brought him unto him : and when he saw him , straightway the spirit tare him ; and he fell on the ground , and wallowed foaming .
BRG	Mark	9	21	And he asked his father , How long is it ago since this came unto him ? And he said , Of a child .
BRG	Mark	9	22	And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire , and into the waters , to destroy him : but if thou canst do any thing , have compassion on us , and help us .
BRG	Mark	9	23	Jesus said unto him , If thou canst believe , all things are possible to him that believeth .
BRG	Mark	9	24	And straightway the father of the child cried out , and said with tears , Lord , I believe ; help thou mine unbelief .
BRG	Mark	9	25	When Jesus saw that the people came running together , he rebuked the foul spirit , saying unto him , Thou dumb and deaf spirit , I charge thee , come out of him , and enter no more into him .
BRG	Mark	9	26	And the spirit cried , and rent him sore , and came out of him : and he was as one dead ; insomuch that many said , He is dead .
BRG	Mark	9	27	But Jesus took him by the hand , and lifted him up ; and he arose .
BRG	Mark	9	28	And when he was come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , Why could not we cast him out ?
BRG	Mark	9	29	And he said unto them , This kind can come forth by nothing , but by prayer and fasting .
BRG	Mark	9	30	And they departed thence , and passed through Galilee ; and he would not that any man should know it .
BRG	Mark	9	31	For he taught his disciples , and said unto them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
BRG	Mark	9	32	But they understood not that saying , and were afraid to ask him .
BRG	Mark	9	33	And he came to Capernaum : and being in the house he asked them , What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way ?
BRG	Mark	9	34	But they held their peace : for by the way they had disputed among themselves , who should be the greatest .
BRG	Mark	9	35	And he sat down , and called the twelve , and saith unto them , If any man desire to be first , the same shall be last of all , and servant of all .
BRG	Mark	9	36	And he took a child , and set him in the midst of them : and when he had taken him in his arms , he said unto them ,
BRG	Mark	9	37	Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name , receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me , receiveth not me , but him that sent me .
BRG	Mark	9	38	And John answered him , saying , Master , we saw one casting out devils in thy name , and he followeth not us : and we forbad him , because he followeth not us .
BRG	Mark	9	39	But Jesus said , Forbid him not : for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name , that can lightly speak evil of me .
BRG	Mark	9	40	For he that is not against us is on our part .
BRG	Mark	9	41	For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to Christ , verily I say unto you , he shall not lose his reward .
BRG	Mark	9	42	And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me , it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea .
BRG	Mark	9	43	And if thy hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
BRG	Mark	9	44	Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
BRG	Mark	9	45	And if thy foot offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter halt into life , than having two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
BRG	Mark	9	46	Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
BRG	Mark	9	47	And if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire :
BRG	Mark	9	48	Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
BRG	Mark	9	49	For every one shall be salted with fire , and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt .
BRG	Mark	9	50	Salt is good : but if the salt have lost his saltness , wherewith will ye season it ? Have salt in yourselves , and have peace one with another . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Mark	9	4145648	""
BRG	Mark	10	10	And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter .
BRG	Mark	10	2	And the Pharisees came to him , and asked him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? tempting him .
BRG	Mark	10	3	And he answered and said unto them , What did Moses command you ?
BRG	Mark	10	4	And they said , Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement , and to put her away .
BRG	Mark	10	5	And Jesus answered and said unto them , For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept .
BRG	Mark	10	6	But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female .
BRG	Mark	10	7	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and cleave to his wife ;
BRG	Mark	10	8	And they twain shall be one flesh : so then they are no more twain , but one flesh .
BRG	Mark	10	9	What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
BRG	Mark	10	11	And he saith unto them , Whosoever shall put away his wife , and marry another , committeth adultery against her .
BRG	Mark	10	12	And if a woman shall put away her husband , and be married to another , she committeth adultery .
BRG	Mark	10	13	And they brought young children to him , that he should touch them : and his disciples rebuked those that brought them .
BRG	Mark	10	14	But when Jesus saw it , he was much displeased , and said unto them , Suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God .
BRG	Mark	10	15	Verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , he shall not enter therein .
BRG	Mark	10	16	And he took them up in his arms , put his hands upon them , and blessed them .
BRG	Mark	10	17	And when he was gone forth into the way , there came one running , and kneeled to him , and asked him , Good Master , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ?
BRG	Mark	10	18	And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , that is , God .
BRG	Mark	10	19	Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Defraud not , Honour thy father and mother .
BRG	Mark	10	20	And he answered and said unto him , Master , all these have I observed from my youth .
BRG	Mark	10	21	Then Jesus beholding him loved him , and said unto him , One thing thou lackest : go thy way , sell whatsoever thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , take up the cross , and follow me .
BRG	Mark	10	22	And he was sad at that saying , and went away grieved : for he had great possessions .
BRG	Mark	10	23	And Jesus looked round about , and saith unto his disciples , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
BRG	Mark	10	24	And the disciples were astonished at his words . But Jesus answereth again , and saith unto them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God !
BRG	Mark	10	25	It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
BRG	Mark	10	26	And they were astonished out of measure , saying among themselves , Who then can be saved ?
BRG	Mark	10	27	And Jesus looking upon them saith , With men it is impossible , but not with God : for with God all things are possible .
BRG	Mark	10	28	Then Peter began to say unto him , Lo , we have left all , and have followed thee .
BRG	Mark	10	29	And Jesus answered and said , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my sake , and the gospel ’ s ,
BRG	Mark	10	30	But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time , houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions ; and in the world to come eternal life .
BRG	Mark	10	31	But many that are first shall be last ; and the last first .
BRG	Mark	10	32	And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem ; and Jesus went before them : and they were amazed ; and as they followed , they were afraid . And he took again the twelve , and began to tell them what things should happen unto him ,
BRG	Mark	10	33	Saying , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests , and unto the scribes ; and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the Gentiles :
BRG	Mark	10	34	And they shall mock him , and shall scourge him , and shall spit upon him , and shall kill him : and the third day he shall rise again .
BRG	Mark	10	35	And James and John , the sons of Zebedee , come unto him , saying , Master , we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire .
BRG	Mark	10	36	And he said unto them , What would ye that I should do for you ?
BRG	Mark	10	37	They said unto him , Grant unto us that we may sit , one on thy right hand , and the other on thy left hand , in thy glory .
BRG	Mark	10	38	But Jesus said unto them , Ye know not what ye ask : can ye drink of the cup that I drink of ? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ?
BRG	Mark	10	39	And they said unto him , We can . And Jesus said unto them , Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of ; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized :
BRG	Mark	10	40	But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared .
BRG	Mark	10	41	And when the ten heard it , they began to be much displeased with James and John .
BRG	Mark	10	42	But Jesus called them to him , and saith unto them , Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them .
BRG	Mark	10	43	But so shall it not be among you : but whosoever will be great among you , shall be your minister :
BRG	Mark	10	44	And whosoever of you will be the chiefest , shall be servant of all .
BRG	Mark	10	45	For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
BRG	Mark	10	46	And they came to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people , blind Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , sat by the highway side begging .
BRG	Mark	10	47	And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out , and say , Jesus , thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
BRG	Mark	10	48	And many charged him that he should hold his peace : but he cried the more a great deal , Thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
BRG	Mark	10	49	And Jesus stood still , and commanded him to be called . And they call the blind man , saying unto him , Be of good comfort , rise ; he calleth thee .
BRG	Mark	10	50	And he , casting away his garment , rose , and came to Jesus .
BRG	Mark	10	51	And Jesus answered and said unto him , What wilt thou that I should do unto thee ? The blind man said unto him , Lord , that I might receive my sight .
BRG	Mark	10	52	And Jesus said unto him , Go thy way ; thy faith hath made thee whole . And immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Mark	10	4145648	""
BRG	Mark	11	11	And Jesus entered into Jerusalem , and into the temple : and when he had looked round about upon all things , and now the eventide was come , he went out unto Bethany with the twelve .
BRG	Mark	11	2	And saith unto them , Go your way into the village over against you : and as soon as ye be entered into it , ye shall find a colt tied , whereon never man sat ; loose him , and bring him .
BRG	Mark	11	3	And if any man say unto you , Why do ye this ? say ye that the Lord hath need of him ; and straightway he will send him hither .
BRG	Mark	11	4	And they went their way , and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met ; and they loose him .
BRG	Mark	11	5	And certain of them that stood there said unto them , What do ye , loosing the colt ?
BRG	Mark	11	6	And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded : and they let them go .
BRG	Mark	11	7	And they brought the colt to Jesus , and cast their garments on him ; and he sat upon him .
BRG	Mark	11	8	And many spread their garments in the way : and others cut down branches off the trees , and strawed them in the way .
BRG	Mark	11	9	And they that went before , and they that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna ; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord :
BRG	Mark	11	10	Blessed be the kingdom of our father David , that cometh in the name of the Lord : Hosanna in the highest .
BRG	Mark	11	12	And on the morrow , when they were come from Bethany , he was hungry :
BRG	Mark	11	13	And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves , he came , if haply he might find any thing thereon : and when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves ; for the time of figs was not yet .
BRG	Mark	11	14	And Jesus answered and said unto it , No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever . And his disciples heard it .
BRG	Mark	11	15	And they come to Jerusalem : and Jesus went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ;
BRG	Mark	11	16	And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple .
BRG	Mark	11	17	And he taught , saying unto them , Is it not written , My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer ? but ye have made it a den of thieves .
BRG	Mark	11	18	And the scribes and chief priests heard it , and sought how they might destroy him : for they feared him , because all the people was astonished at his doctrine .
BRG	Mark	11	19	And when even was come , he went out of the city .
BRG	Mark	11	20	And in the morning , as they passed by , they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots .
BRG	Mark	11	21	And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him , Master , behold , the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away .
BRG	Mark	11	22	And Jesus answering saith unto them , Have faith in God .
BRG	Mark	11	23	For verily I say unto you , That whosoever shall say unto this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; and shall not doubt in his heart , but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass ; he shall have whatsoever he saith .
BRG	Mark	11	24	Therefore I say unto you , What things soever ye desire , when ye pray , believe that ye receive them , and ye shall have them .
BRG	Mark	11	25	And when ye stand praying , forgive , if ye have ought against any : that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses .
BRG	Mark	11	26	But if ye do not forgive , neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses .
BRG	Mark	11	27	And they come again to Jerusalem : and as he was walking in the temple , there come to him the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders ,
BRG	Mark	11	28	And say unto him , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority to do these things ?
BRG	Mark	11	29	And Jesus answered and said unto them , I will also ask of you one question , and answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
BRG	Mark	11	30	The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or of men ? answer me .
BRG	Mark	11	31	And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then did ye not believe him ?
BRG	Mark	11	32	But if we shall say , Of men ; they feared the people : for all men counted John , that he was a prophet indeed .
BRG	Mark	11	33	And they answered and said unto Jesus , We can not tell . And Jesus answering saith unto them , Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Mark	12	12	And they sought to lay hold on him , but feared the people : for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them : and they left him , and went their way .
BRG	Mark	12	2	And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard .
BRG	Mark	12	3	And they caught him , and beat him , and sent him away empty .
BRG	Mark	12	4	And again he sent unto them another servant ; and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully handled .
BRG	Mark	12	5	And again he sent another ; and him they killed , and many others ; beating some , and killing some .
BRG	Mark	12	6	Having yet therefore one son , his wellbeloved , he sent him also last unto them , saying , They will reverence my son .
BRG	Mark	12	7	But those husbandmen said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be our ’ s .
BRG	Mark	12	8	And they took him , and killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard .
BRG	Mark	12	9	What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others .
BRG	Mark	12	10	And have ye not read this scripture ; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner :
BRG	Mark	12	11	This was the Lord ’ s doing , and it is marvellous in our eyes ?
BRG	Mark	12	13	And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians , to catch him in his words .
BRG	Mark	12	14	And when they were come , they say unto him , Master , we know that thou art true , and carest for no man : for thou regardest not the person of men , but teachest the way of God in truth : Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar , or not ?
BRG	Mark	12	15	Shall we give , or shall we not give ? But he , knowing their hypocrisy , said unto them , Why tempt ye me ? bring me a penny , that I may see it .
BRG	Mark	12	16	And they brought it . And he saith unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ? And they said unto him , Caesar ’ s .
BRG	Mark	12	17	And Jesus answering said unto them , Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’ s , and to God the things that are God ’ s . And they marvelled at him .
BRG	Mark	12	18	Then come unto him the Sadducees , which say there is no resurrection ; and they asked him , saying ,
BRG	Mark	12	19	Master , Moses wrote unto us , If a man ’ s brother die , and leave his wife behind him , and leave no children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
BRG	Mark	12	20	Now there were seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and dying left no seed .
BRG	Mark	12	21	And the second took her , and died , neither left he any seed : and the third likewise .
BRG	Mark	12	22	And the seven had her , and left no seed : last of all the woman died also .
BRG	Mark	12	23	In the resurrection therefore , when they shall rise , whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her to wife .
BRG	Mark	12	24	And Jesus answering said unto them , Do ye not therefore err , because ye know not the scriptures , neither the power of God ?
BRG	Mark	12	25	For when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as the angels which are in heaven .
BRG	Mark	12	26	And as touching the dead , that they rise : have ye not read in the book of Moses , how in the bush God spake unto him , saying , I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ?
BRG	Mark	12	27	He is not the God of the dead , but the God of the living : ye therefore do greatly err .
BRG	Mark	12	28	And one of the scribes came , and having heard them reasoning together , and perceiving that he had answered them well , asked him , Which is the first commandment of all ?
BRG	Mark	12	29	And Jesus answered him , The first of all the commandments is , Hear , O Israel ; The Lord our God is one Lord :
BRG	Mark	12	30	And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength : this is the first commandment .
BRG	Mark	12	31	And the second is like , namely this , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself . There is none other commandment greater than these .
BRG	Mark	12	32	And the scribe said unto him , Well , Master , thou hast said the truth : for there is one God ; and there is none other but he :
BRG	Mark	12	33	And to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbour as himself , is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices .
BRG	Mark	12	34	And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly , he said unto him , Thou art not far from the kingdom of God . And no man after that durst ask him any question .
BRG	Mark	12	35	And Jesus answered and said , while he taught in the temple , How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David ?
BRG	Mark	12	36	For David himself said by the Holy Ghost , The Lord said to my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool .
BRG	Mark	12	37	David therefore himself calleth him Lord ; and whence is he then his son ? And the common people heard him gladly .
BRG	Mark	12	38	And he said unto them in his doctrine , Beware of the scribes , which love to go in long clothing , and love salutations in the marketplaces ,
BRG	Mark	12	39	And the chief seats in the synagogues , and the uppermost rooms at feasts :
BRG	Mark	12	40	Which devour widows ’ houses , and for a pretence make long prayers : these shall receive greater damnation .
BRG	Mark	12	41	And Jesus sat over against the treasury , and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury : and many that were rich cast in much .
BRG	Mark	12	42	And there came a certain poor widow , and she threw in two mites , which make a farthing .
BRG	Mark	12	43	And he called unto him his disciples , and saith unto them , Verily I say unto you , That this poor widow hath cast more in , than all they which have cast into the treasury :
BRG	Mark	12	44	For all they did cast in of their abundance ; but she of her want did cast in all that she had , even all her living . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Mark	13	13	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name ’ s sake : but he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
BRG	Mark	13	2	And Jesus answering said unto him , Seest thou these great buildings ? there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
BRG	Mark	13	3	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple , Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately ,
BRG	Mark	13	4	Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled ?
BRG	Mark	13	5	And Jesus answering them began to say , Take heed lest any man deceive you :
BRG	Mark	13	6	For many shall come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and shall deceive many .
BRG	Mark	13	7	And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , be ye not troubled : for such things must needs be ; but the end shall not be yet .
BRG	Mark	13	8	For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be earthquakes in divers places , and there shall be famines and troubles : these are the beginnings of sorrows .
BRG	Mark	13	9	But take heed to yourselves : for they shall deliver you up to councils ; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten : and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them .
BRG	Mark	13	10	And the gospel must first be published among all nations .
BRG	Mark	13	11	But when they shall lead you , and deliver you up , take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak , neither do ye premeditate : but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ye : for it is not ye that speak , but the Holy Ghost .
BRG	Mark	13	12	Now the brother shall betray the brother to death , and the father the son ; and children shall rise up against their parents , and shall cause them to be put to death .
BRG	Mark	13	14	But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not , ( let him that readeth understand , ) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains :
BRG	Mark	13	15	And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house , neither enter therein , to take any thing out of his house :
BRG	Mark	13	16	And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment .
BRG	Mark	13	17	But woe to them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
BRG	Mark	13	18	And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter .
BRG	Mark	13	19	For in those days shall be affliction , such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time , neither shall be .
BRG	Mark	13	20	And except that the Lord had shortened those days , no flesh should be saved : but for the elect ’ s sake , whom he hath chosen , he hath shortened the days .
BRG	Mark	13	21	And then if any man shall say to you , Lo , here is Christ ; or , lo , he is there ; believe him not :
BRG	Mark	13	22	For false Christs and false prophets shall rise , and shall shew signs and wonders , to seduce , if it were possible , even the elect .
BRG	Mark	13	23	But take ye heed : behold , I have foretold you all things .
BRG	Mark	13	24	But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light ,
BRG	Mark	13	25	And the stars of heaven shall fall , and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken .
BRG	Mark	13	26	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory .
BRG	Mark	13	27	And then shall he send his angels , and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven .
BRG	Mark	13	28	Now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When her branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is near :
BRG	Mark	13	29	So ye in like manner , when ye shall see these things come to pass , know that it is nigh , even at the doors .
BRG	Mark	13	30	Verily I say unto you , that this generation shall not pass , till all these things be done .
BRG	Mark	13	31	Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
BRG	Mark	13	32	But of that day and that hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels which are in heaven , neither the Son , but the Father .
BRG	Mark	13	33	Take ye heed , watch and pray : for ye know not when the time is .
BRG	Mark	13	34	For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey , who left his house , and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and commanded the porter to watch .
BRG	Mark	13	35	Watch ye therefore : for ye know not when the master of the house cometh , at even , or at midnight , or at the cockcrowing , or in the morning :
BRG	Mark	13	36	Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping .
BRG	Mark	13	37	And what I say unto you I say unto all , Watch . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Mark	13	4145648	""
BRG	Mark	14	14	And wheresoever he shall go in , say ye to the goodman of the house , The Master saith , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
BRG	Mark	14	2	But they said , Not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar of the people .
BRG	Mark	14	3	And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at meat , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious ; and she brake the box , and poured it on his head .
BRG	Mark	14	4	And there were some that had indignation within themselves , and said , Why was this waste of the ointment made ?
BRG	Mark	14	5	For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence , and have been given to the poor . And they murmured against her .
BRG	Mark	14	6	And Jesus said , Let her alone ; why trouble ye her ? she hath wrought a good work on me .
BRG	Mark	14	7	For ye have the poor with you always , and whensoever ye will ye may do them good : but me ye have not always .
BRG	Mark	14	8	She hath done what she could : she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying .
BRG	Mark	14	9	Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world , this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her .
BRG	Mark	14	10	And Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , went unto the chief priests , to betray him unto them .
BRG	Mark	14	11	And when they heard it , they were glad , and promised to give him money . And he sought how he might conveniently betray him .
BRG	Mark	14	12	And the first day of unleavened bread , when they killed the passover , his disciples said unto him , Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover ?
BRG	Mark	14	13	And he sendeth forth two of his disciples , and saith unto them , Go ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him .
BRG	Mark	14	15	And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared : there make ready for us .
BRG	Mark	14	16	And his disciples went forth , and came into the city , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
BRG	Mark	14	17	And in the evening he cometh with the twelve .
BRG	Mark	14	18	And as they sat and did eat , Jesus said , Verily I say unto you , One of you which eateth with me shall betray me .
BRG	Mark	14	19	And they began to be sorrowful , and to say unto him one by one , Is it I ? and another said , Is it I ?
BRG	Mark	14	20	And he answered and said unto them , It is one of the twelve , that dippeth with me in the dish .
BRG	Mark	14	21	The Son of man indeed goeth , as it is written of him : but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born .
BRG	Mark	14	22	And as they did eat , Jesus took bread , and blessed , and brake it , and gave to them , and said , Take , eat : this is my body .
BRG	Mark	14	23	And he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them : and they all drank of it .
BRG	Mark	14	24	And he said unto them , This is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many .
BRG	Mark	14	25	Verily I say unto you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God .
BRG	Mark	14	26	And when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of Olives .
BRG	Mark	14	27	And Jesus saith unto them , All ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered .
BRG	Mark	14	28	But after that I am risen , I will go before you into Galilee .
BRG	Mark	14	29	But Peter said unto him , Although all shall be offended , yet will not I .
BRG	Mark	14	30	And Jesus saith unto him , Verily I say unto thee , That this day , even in this night , before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice .
BRG	Mark	14	31	But he spake the more vehemently , If I should die with thee , I will not deny thee in any wise . Likewise also said they all .
BRG	Mark	14	32	And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane : and he saith to his disciples , Sit ye here , while I shall pray .
BRG	Mark	14	33	And he taketh with him Peter and James and John , and began to be sore amazed , and to be very heavy ;
BRG	Mark	14	34	And saith unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death : tarry ye here , and watch .
BRG	Mark	14	35	And he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass from him .
BRG	Mark	14	36	And he said , Abba , Father , all things are possible unto thee ; take away this cup from me : nevertheless not what I will , but what thou wilt .
BRG	Mark	14	37	And he cometh , and findeth them sleeping , and saith unto Peter , Simon , sleepest thou ? couldest not thou watch one hour ?
BRG	Mark	14	38	Watch ye and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . The Spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is weak .
BRG	Mark	14	39	And again he went away , and prayed , and spake the same words .
BRG	Mark	14	40	And when he returned , he found them asleep again , ( for their eyes were heavy , ) neither wist they what to answer him .
BRG	Mark	14	41	And he cometh the third time , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : it is enough , the hour is come ; behold , the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
BRG	Mark	14	42	Rise up , let us go ; lo , he that betrayeth me is at hand .
BRG	Mark	14	43	And immediately , while he yet spake , cometh Judas , one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
BRG	Mark	14	44	And he that betrayed him had given them a token , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he ; take him , and lead him away safely .
BRG	Mark	14	45	And as soon as he was come , he goeth straightway to him , and saith , Master , master ; and kissed him .
BRG	Mark	14	46	And they laid their hands on him , and took him .
BRG	Mark	14	47	And one of them that stood by drew a sword , and smote a servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
BRG	Mark	14	48	And Jesus answered and said unto them , Are ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and with staves to take me ?
BRG	Mark	14	49	I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and ye took me not : but the scriptures must be fulfilled .
BRG	Mark	14	50	And they all forsook him , and fled .
BRG	Mark	14	51	And there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
BRG	Mark	14	52	And he left the linen cloth , and fled from them naked .
BRG	Mark	14	53	And they led Jesus away to the high priest : and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes .
BRG	Mark	14	54	And Peter followed him afar off , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire .
BRG	Mark	14	55	And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death ; and found none .
BRG	Mark	14	56	For many bare false witness against him , but their witness agreed not together .
BRG	Mark	14	57	And there arose certain , and bare false witness against him , saying ,
BRG	Mark	14	58	We heard him say , I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and within three days I will build another made without hands .
BRG	Mark	14	59	But neither so did their witness agree together .
BRG	Mark	14	60	And the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
BRG	Mark	14	61	But he held his peace , and answered nothing . Again the high priest asked him , and said unto him , Art thou the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ?
BRG	Mark	14	62	And Jesus said , I am : and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven .
BRG	Mark	14	63	Then the high priest rent his clothes , and saith , What need we any further witnesses ?
BRG	Mark	14	64	Ye have heard the blasphemy : what think ye ? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death .
BRG	Mark	14	65	And some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say unto him , Prophesy : and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands .
BRG	Mark	14	66	And as Peter was beneath in the palace , there cometh one of the maids of the high priest :
BRG	Mark	14	67	And when she saw Peter warming himself , she looked upon him , and said , And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth .
BRG	Mark	14	68	But he denied , saying , I know not , neither understand I what thou sayest . And he went out into the porch ; and the cock crew .
BRG	Mark	14	69	And a maid saw him again , and began to say to them that stood by , This is one of them .
BRG	Mark	14	70	And he denied it again . And a little after , they that stood by said again to Peter , Surely thou art one of them : for thou art a Galilaean , and thy speech agreeth thereto .
BRG	Mark	14	71	But he began to curse and to swear , saying , I know not this man of whom ye speak .
BRG	Mark	14	72	And the second time the cock crew . And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him , Before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . And when he thought thereon , he wept . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Mark	14	4145648	""
BRG	Mark	15	15	And so Pilate , willing to content the people , released Barabbas unto them , and delivered Jesus , when he had scourged him , to be crucified .
BRG	Mark	15	2	And Pilate asked him , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answering said unto him , Thou sayest it .
BRG	Mark	15	3	And the chief priests accused him of many things : but he answered nothing .
BRG	Mark	15	4	And Pilate asked him again , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? behold how many things they witness against thee .
BRG	Mark	15	5	But Jesus yet answered nothing ; so that Pilate marvelled .
BRG	Mark	15	6	Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner , whomsoever they desired .
BRG	Mark	15	7	And there was one named Barabbas , which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him , who had committed murder in the insurrection .
BRG	Mark	15	8	And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them .
BRG	Mark	15	9	But Pilate answered them , saying , Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
BRG	Mark	15	10	For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy .
BRG	Mark	15	11	But the chief priests moved the people , that he should rather release Barabbas unto them .
BRG	Mark	15	12	And Pilate answered and said again unto them , What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews ?
BRG	Mark	15	13	And they cried out again , Crucify him .
BRG	Mark	15	14	Then Pilate said unto them , Why , what evil hath he done ? And they cried out the more exceedingly , Crucify him .
BRG	Mark	15	16	And the soldiers led him away into the hall , called Praetorium ; and they call together the whole band .
BRG	Mark	15	17	And they clothed him with purple , and platted a crown of thorns , and put it about his head ,
BRG	Mark	15	18	And began to salute him , Hail , King of the Jews !
BRG	Mark	15	19	And they smote him on the head with a reed , and did spit upon him , and bowing their knees worshipped him .
BRG	Mark	15	20	And when they had mocked him , they took off the purple from him , and put his own clothes on him , and led him out to crucify him .
BRG	Mark	15	21	And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian , who passed by , coming out of the country , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to bear his cross .
BRG	Mark	15	22	And they bring him unto the place Golgotha , which is , being interpreted , The place of a skull .
BRG	Mark	15	23	And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh : but he received it not .
BRG	Mark	15	24	And when they had crucified him , they parted his garments , casting lots upon them , what every man should take .
BRG	Mark	15	25	And it was the third hour , and they crucified him .
BRG	Mark	15	26	And the superscription of his accusation was written over , The King of the Jews .
BRG	Mark	15	27	And with him they crucify two thieves ; the one on his right hand , and the other on his left .
BRG	Mark	15	28	And the scripture was fulfilled , which saith , And he was numbered with the transgressors .
BRG	Mark	15	29	And they that passed by railed on him , wagging their heads , and saying , Ah , thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days ,
BRG	Mark	15	30	Save thyself , and come down from the cross .
BRG	Mark	15	31	Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes , He saved others ; himself he can not save .
BRG	Mark	15	32	Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross , that we may see and believe . And they that were crucified with him reviled him .
BRG	Mark	15	33	And when the sixth hour was come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
BRG	Mark	15	34	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? which is , being interpreted , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ?
BRG	Mark	15	35	And some of them that stood by , when they heard it , said , Behold , he calleth Elias .
BRG	Mark	15	36	And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let alone ; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down .
BRG	Mark	15	37	And Jesus cried with a loud voice , and gave up the ghost .
BRG	Mark	15	38	And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom .
BRG	Mark	15	39	And when the centurion , which stood over against him , saw that he so cried out , and gave up the ghost , he said , Truly this man was the Son of God .
BRG	Mark	15	40	There were also women looking on afar off : among whom was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses , and Salome ;
BRG	Mark	15	41	( Who also , when he was in Galilee , followed him , and ministered unto him ; ) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem .
BRG	Mark	15	42	And now when the even was come , because it was the preparation , that is , the day before the sabbath ,
BRG	Mark	15	43	Joseph of Arimathaea , an honourable counsellor , which also waited for the kingdom of God , came , and went in boldly unto Pilate , and craved the body of Jesus .
BRG	Mark	15	44	And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead : and calling unto him the centurion , he asked him whether he had been any while dead .
BRG	Mark	15	45	And when he knew it of the centurion , he gave the body to Joseph .
BRG	Mark	15	46	And he bought fine linen , and took him down , and wrapped him in the linen , and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock , and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre .
BRG	Mark	15	47	And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Mark	16	16	He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved ; but he that believeth not shall be damned .
BRG	Mark	16	2	And very early in the morning the first day of the week , they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun .
BRG	Mark	16	3	And they said among themselves , Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre ?
BRG	Mark	16	4	And when they looked , they saw that the stone was rolled away : for it was very great .
BRG	Mark	16	5	And entering into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clothed in a long white garment ; and they were affrighted .
BRG	Mark	16	6	And he saith unto them , Be not affrighted : Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth , which was crucified : he is risen ; he is not here : behold the place where they laid him .
BRG	Mark	16	7	But go your way , tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee : there shall ye see him , as he said unto you .
BRG	Mark	16	8	And they went out quickly , and fled from the sepulchre ; for they trembled and were amazed : neither said they any thing to any man ; for they were afraid .
BRG	Mark	16	9	Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , out of whom he had cast seven devils .
BRG	Mark	16	10	And she went and told them that had been with him , as they mourned and wept .
BRG	Mark	16	11	And they , when they had heard that he was alive , and had been seen of her , believed not .
BRG	Mark	16	12	After that he appeared in another form unto two of them , as they walked , and went into the country .
BRG	Mark	16	13	And they went and told it unto the residue : neither believed they them .
BRG	Mark	16	14	Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat , and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart , because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen .
BRG	Mark	16	15	And he said unto them , Go ye into all the world , and preach the gospel to every creature .
BRG	Mark	16	17	And these signs shall follow them that believe ; In my name shall they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ;
BRG	Mark	16	18	They shall take up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover .
BRG	Mark	16	19	So then after the Lord had spoken unto them , he was received up into heaven , and sat on the right hand of God .
BRG	Mark	16	20	And they went forth , and preached every where , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word with signs following . Amen . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Mark	16	4145648	""
BRG	Luke	1	1	Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us ,
BRG	Luke	1	2	Even as they delivered them unto us , which from the beginning were eyewitnesses , and ministers of the word ;
BRG	Luke	1	3	It seemed good to me also , having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first , to write unto thee in order , most excellent Theophilus ,
BRG	Luke	1	4	That thou mightest know the certainty of those things , wherein thou hast been instructed .
BRG	Luke	1	5	There was in the days of Herod , the king of Judaea , a certain priest named Zacharias , of the course of Abia : and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elisabeth .
BRG	Luke	1	6	And they were both righteous before God , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless .
BRG	Luke	1	7	And they had no child , because that Elisabeth was barren , and they both were now well stricken in years .
BRG	Luke	1	8	And it came to pass , that while he executed the priest ’ s office before God in the order of his course ,
BRG	Luke	1	9	According to the custom of the priest ’ s office , his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord .
BRG	Luke	1	10	And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense .
BRG	Luke	1	11	And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
BRG	Luke	1	12	And when Zacharias saw him , he was troubled , and fear fell upon him .
BRG	Luke	1	13	But the angel said unto him , Fear not , Zacharias : for thy prayer is heard ; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John .
BRG	Luke	1	14	And thou shalt have joy and gladness ; and many shall rejoice at his birth .
BRG	Luke	1	15	For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord , and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink ; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost , even from his mother ’ s womb .
BRG	Luke	1	16	And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God .
BRG	Luke	1	17	And he shall go before him in the Spirit and power of Elias , to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just ; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord .
BRG	Luke	1	18	And Zacharias said unto the angel , Whereby shall I know this ? for I am an old man , and my wife well stricken in years .
BRG	Luke	1	19	And the angel answering said unto him , I am Gabriel , that stand in the presence of God ; and am sent to speak unto thee , and to shew thee these glad tidings .
BRG	Luke	1	20	And , behold , thou shalt be dumb , and not able to speak , until the day that these things shall be performed , because thou believest not my words , which shall be fulfilled in their season .
BRG	Luke	1	21	And the people waited for Zacharias , and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple .
BRG	Luke	1	22	And when he came out , he could not speak unto them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple : for he beckoned unto them , and remained speechless .
BRG	Luke	1	23	And it came to pass , that , as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished , he departed to his own house .
BRG	Luke	1	24	And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived , and hid herself five months , saying ,
BRG	Luke	1	25	Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me , to take away my reproach among men .
BRG	Luke	1	26	And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee , named Nazareth ,
BRG	Luke	1	27	To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin ’ s name was Mary .
BRG	Luke	1	28	And the angel came in unto her , and said , Hail , thou that art highly favoured , the Lord is with thee : blessed art thou among women .
BRG	Luke	1	29	And when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying , and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be .
BRG	Luke	1	30	And the angel said unto her , Fear not , Mary : for thou hast found favour with God .
BRG	Luke	1	31	And , behold , thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name Jesus .
BRG	Luke	1	32	He shall be great , and shall be called the Son of the Highest : and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David :
BRG	Luke	1	33	And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end .
BRG	Luke	1	34	Then said Mary unto the angel , How shall this be , seeing I know not a man ?
BRG	Luke	1	35	And the angel answered and said unto her , The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee , and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee : therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God .
BRG	Luke	1	36	And , behold , thy cousin Elisabeth , she hath also conceived a son in her old age : and this is the sixth month with her , who was called barren .
BRG	Luke	1	37	For with God nothing shall be impossible .
BRG	Luke	1	38	And Mary said , Behold the handmaid of the Lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . And the angel departed from her .
BRG	Luke	1	39	And Mary arose in those days , and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of Juda ;
BRG	Luke	1	40	And entered into the house of Zacharias , and saluted Elisabeth .
BRG	Luke	1	41	And it came to pass , that , when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary , the babe leaped in her womb ; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost :
BRG	Luke	1	42	And she spake out with a loud voice , and said , Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb .
BRG	Luke	1	43	And whence is this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
BRG	Luke	1	44	For , lo , as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy .
BRG	Luke	1	45	And blessed is she that believed : for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord .
BRG	Luke	1	46	And Mary said , My soul doth magnify the Lord ,
BRG	Luke	1	47	And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour .
BRG	Luke	1	48	For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden : for , behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed .
BRG	Luke	1	49	For he that is mighty hath done to me great things ; and holy is his name .
BRG	Luke	1	50	And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation .
BRG	Luke	1	51	He hath shewed strength with his arm ; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts .
BRG	Luke	1	52	He hath put down the mighty from their seats , and exalted them of low degree .
BRG	Luke	1	53	He hath filled the hungry with good things ; and the rich he hath sent empty away .
BRG	Luke	1	54	He hath holpen his servant Israel , in remembrance of his mercy ;
BRG	Luke	1	55	As he spake to our fathers , to Abraham , and to his seed for ever .
BRG	Luke	1	56	And Mary abode with her about three months , and returned to her own house .
BRG	Luke	1	57	Now Elisabeth ’ s full time came that she should be delivered ; and she brought forth a son .
BRG	Luke	1	58	And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her ; and they rejoiced with her .
BRG	Luke	1	59	And it came to pass , that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child ; and they called him Zacharias , after the name of his father .
BRG	Luke	1	60	And his mother answered and said , Not so ; but he shall be called John .
BRG	Luke	1	61	And they said unto her , There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name .
BRG	Luke	1	62	And they made signs to his father , how he would have him called .
BRG	Luke	1	63	And he asked for a writing table , and wrote , saying , His name is John . And they marvelled all .
BRG	Luke	1	64	And his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue loosed , and he spake , and praised God .
BRG	Luke	1	65	And fear came on all that dwelt round about them : and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea .
BRG	Luke	1	66	And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , What manner of child shall this be ! And the hand of the Lord was with him .
BRG	Luke	1	67	And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost , and prophesied , saying ,
BRG	Luke	1	68	Blessed be the Lord God of Israel ; for he hath visited and redeemed his people ,
BRG	Luke	1	69	And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David ;
BRG	Luke	1	70	As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets , which have been since the world began :
BRG	Luke	1	71	That we should be saved from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ;
BRG	Luke	1	72	To perform the mercy promised to our fathers , and to remember his holy covenant ;
BRG	Luke	1	73	The oath which he sware to our father Abraham ,
BRG	Luke	1	74	That he would grant unto us , that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear ,
BRG	Luke	1	75	In holiness and righteousness before him , all the days of our life .
BRG	Luke	1	76	And thou , child , shalt be called the prophet of the Highest : for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways ;
BRG	Luke	1	77	To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins ,
BRG	Luke	1	78	Through the tender mercy of our God ; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us ,
BRG	Luke	1	79	To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , to guide our feet into the way of peace .

BRG	Luke	2	2	( And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria . )
BRG	Luke	2	3	And all went to be taxed , every one into his own city .
BRG	Luke	2	4	And Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judaea , unto the city of David , which is called Bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and lineage of David : )
BRG	Luke	2	5	To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife , being great with child .
BRG	Luke	2	6	And so it was , that , while they were there , the days were accomplished that she should be delivered .
BRG	Luke	2	7	And she brought forth her firstborn son , and wrapped him in swaddling clothes , and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn .
BRG	Luke	2	8	And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night .
BRG	Luke	2	9	And , lo , the angel of the Lord came upon them , and the glory of the Lord shone round about them : and they were sore afraid .
BRG	Luke	2	10	And the angel said unto them , Fear not : for , behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people .
BRG	Luke	2	11	For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour , which is Christ the Lord .
BRG	Luke	2	12	And this shall be a sign unto you ; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes , lying in a manger .
BRG	Luke	2	13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God , and saying ,
BRG	Luke	2	14	Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace , good will toward men .
BRG	Luke	2	15	And it came to pass , as the angels were gone away from them into heaven , the shepherds said one to another , Let us now go even unto Bethlehem , and see this thing which is come to pass , which the Lord hath made known unto us .
BRG	Luke	2	16	And they came with haste , and found Mary , and Joseph , and the babe lying in a manger .
BRG	Luke	2	17	And when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
BRG	Luke	2	18	And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds .
BRG	Luke	2	19	But Mary kept all these things , and pondered them in her heart .
BRG	Luke	2	20	And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , as it was told unto them .
BRG	Luke	2	21	And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child , his name was called Jesus , which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
BRG	Luke	2	22	And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished , they brought him to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord ;
BRG	Luke	2	23	( As it is written in the law of the Lord , Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ; )
BRG	Luke	2	24	And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord , A pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons .
BRG	Luke	2	25	And , behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy Ghost was upon him .
BRG	Luke	2	26	And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord ’ s Christ .
BRG	Luke	2	27	And he came by the Spirit into the temple : and when the parents brought in the child Jesus , to do for him after the custom of the law ,
BRG	Luke	2	28	Then took he him up in his arms , and blessed God , and said ,
BRG	Luke	2	29	Lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace , according to thy word :
BRG	Luke	2	30	For mine eyes have seen thy salvation ,
BRG	Luke	2	31	Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people ;
BRG	Luke	2	32	A light to lighten the Gentiles , and the glory of thy people Israel .
BRG	Luke	2	33	And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him .
BRG	Luke	2	34	And Simeon blessed them , and said unto Mary his mother , Behold , this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel ; and for a sign which shall be spoken against ;
BRG	Luke	2	35	( Yea , a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also , ) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed .
BRG	Luke	2	36	And there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Aser : she was of a great age , and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity ;
BRG	Luke	2	37	And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years , which departed not from the temple , but served God with fastings and prayers night and day .
BRG	Luke	2	38	And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord , and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem .
BRG	Luke	2	39	And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own city Nazareth .
BRG	Luke	2	40	And the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , filled with wisdom : and the grace of God was upon him .
BRG	Luke	2	41	Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover .
BRG	Luke	2	42	And when he was twelve years old , they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast .
BRG	Luke	2	43	And when they had fulfilled the days , as they returned , the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem ; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it .
BRG	Luke	2	44	But they , supposing him to have been in the company , went a day ’ s journey ; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance .
BRG	Luke	2	45	And when they found him not , they turned back again to Jerusalem , seeking him .
BRG	Luke	2	46	And it came to pass , that after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the doctors , both hearing them , and asking them questions .
BRG	Luke	2	47	And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers .
BRG	Luke	2	48	And when they saw him , they were amazed : and his mother said unto him , Son , why hast thou thus dealt with us ? behold , thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing .
BRG	Luke	2	49	And he said unto them , How is it that ye sought me ? wist ye not that I must be about my Father ’ s business ?
BRG	Luke	2	50	And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them .
BRG	Luke	2	51	And he went down with them , and came to Nazareth , and was subject unto them : but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
BRG	Luke	2	52	And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature , and in favour with God and man . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Luke	3	3	And he came into all the country about Jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins ;
BRG	Luke	3	2	Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests , the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness .
BRG	Luke	3	4	As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet , saying , The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight . ( A )
BRG	Luke	3	5	Every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough ways shall be made smooth ; ( B )
BRG	Luke	3	6	And all flesh shall see the salvation of God . ( C )
BRG	Luke	3	7	Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
BRG	Luke	3	8	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
BRG	Luke	3	9	And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
BRG	Luke	3	10	And the people asked him , saying , What shall we do then ?
BRG	Luke	3	11	He answereth and saith unto them , He that hath two coats , let him impart to him that hath none ; and he that hath meat , let him do likewise .
BRG	Luke	3	12	Then came also publicans to be baptized , and said unto him , Master , what shall we do ?
BRG	Luke	3	13	And he said unto them , Exact no more than that which is appointed you .
BRG	Luke	3	14	And the soldiers likewise demanded of him , saying , And what shall we do ? And he said unto them , Do violence to no man , neither accuse any falsely ; and be content with your wages .
BRG	Luke	3	15	And as the people were in expectation , and all men mused in their hearts of John , whether he were the Christ , or not ;
BRG	Luke	3	16	John answered , saying unto them all , I indeed baptize you with water ; but one mightier than I cometh , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose : he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire :
BRG	Luke	3	17	Whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and will gather the wheat into his garner ; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable .
BRG	Luke	3	18	And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people .
BRG	Luke	3	19	But Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip ’ s wife , and for all the evils which Herod had done ,
BRG	Luke	3	20	Added yet this above all , that he shut up John in prison .
BRG	Luke	3	21	Now when all the people were baptized , it came to pass , that Jesus also being baptized , and praying , the heaven was opened ,
BRG	Luke	3	22	And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him , and a voice came from heaven , which said , Thou art my beloved Son ; in thee I am well pleased .

BRG	Luke	4	4	And Jesus answered him , saying , It is written , That man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God .
BRG	Luke	4	2	Being forty days tempted of the devil . And in those days he did eat nothing : and when they were ended , he afterward hungered .
BRG	Luke	4	3	And the devil said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , command this stone that it be made bread .
BRG	Luke	4	5	And the devil , taking him up into an high mountain , shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
BRG	Luke	4	6	And the devil said unto him , All this power will I give thee , and the glory of them : for that is delivered unto me ; and to whomsoever I will I give it .
BRG	Luke	4	7	If thou therefore wilt worship me , all shall be thine .
BRG	Luke	4	8	And Jesus answered and said unto him , Get thee behind me , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
BRG	Luke	4	9	And he brought him to Jerusalem , and set him on a pinnacle of the temple , and said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , cast thyself down from hence :
BRG	Luke	4	10	For it is written , He shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee :
BRG	Luke	4	11	And in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone .
BRG	Luke	4	12	And Jesus answering said unto him , It is said , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
BRG	Luke	4	13	And when the devil had ended all the temptation , he departed from him for a season .
BRG	Luke	4	14	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about .
BRG	Luke	4	15	And he taught in their synagogues , being glorified of all .
BRG	Luke	4	16	And he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up : and , as his custom was , he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and stood up for to read .
BRG	Luke	4	17	And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias . And when he had opened the book , he found the place where it was written ,
BRG	Luke	4	18	The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor ; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted , to preach deliverance to the captives , and recovering of sight to the blind , to set at liberty them that are bruised ,
BRG	Luke	4	19	To preach the acceptable year of the Lord .
BRG	Luke	4	20	And he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down . And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him .
BRG	Luke	4	21	And he began to say unto them , This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears .
BRG	Luke	4	22	And all bare him witness , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth . And they said , Is not this Joseph ’ s son ?
BRG	Luke	4	23	And he said unto them , Ye will surely say unto me this proverb , Physician , heal thyself : whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum , do also here in thy country .
BRG	Luke	4	24	And he said , Verily I say unto you , No prophet is accepted in his own country .
BRG	Luke	4	25	But I tell you of a truth , many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months , when great famine was throughout all the land ;
BRG	Luke	4	26	But unto none of them was Elias sent , save unto Sarepta , a city of Sidon , unto a woman that was a widow .
BRG	Luke	4	27	And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , saving Naaman the Syrian .
BRG	Luke	4	28	And all they in the synagogue , when they heard these things , were filled with wrath ,
BRG	Luke	4	29	And rose up , and thrust him out of the city , and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built , that they might cast him down headlong .
BRG	Luke	4	30	But he passing through the midst of them went his way ,
BRG	Luke	4	31	And came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and taught them on the sabbath days .
BRG	Luke	4	32	And they were astonished at his doctrine : for his word was with power .
BRG	Luke	4	33	And in the synagogue there was a man , which had a spirit of an unclean devil , and cried out with a loud voice ,
BRG	Luke	4	34	Saying , Let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art ; the Holy One of God .
BRG	Luke	4	35	And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him . And when the devil had thrown him in the midst , he came out of him , and hurt him not .
BRG	Luke	4	36	And they were all amazed , and spake among themselves , saying , What a word is this ! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits , and they come out .
BRG	Luke	4	37	And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about .
BRG	Luke	4	38	And he arose out of the synagogue , and entered into Simon ’ s house . And Simon ’ s wife ’ s mother was taken with a great fever ; and they besought him for her .
BRG	Luke	4	39	And he stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her : and immediately she arose and ministered unto them .
BRG	Luke	4	40	Now when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
BRG	Luke	4	41	And devils also came out of many , crying out , and saying , Thou art Christ the Son of God . And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak : for they knew that he was Christ .
BRG	Luke	4	42	And when it was day , he departed and went into a desert place : and the people sought him , and came unto him , and stayed him , that he should not depart from them .
BRG	Luke	4	43	And he said unto them , I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also : for therefore am I sent .

BRG	Luke	5	5	And Simon answering said unto him , Master , we have toiled all the night , and have taken nothing : nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net .
BRG	Luke	5	2	And saw two ships standing by the lake : but the fishermen were gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
BRG	Luke	5	3	And he entered into one of the ships , which was Simon ’ s , and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land . And he sat down , and taught the people out of the ship .
BRG	Luke	5	4	Now when he had left speaking , he said unto Simon , Launch out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught .
BRG	Luke	5	6	And when they had this done , they inclosed a great multitude of fishes : and their net brake .
BRG	Luke	5	7	And they beckoned unto their partners , which were in the other ship , that they should come and help them . And they came , and filled both the ships , so that they began to sink .
BRG	Luke	5	8	When Simon Peter saw it , he fell down at Jesus ’ knees , saying , Depart from me ; for I am a sinful man , O Lord .
BRG	Luke	5	9	For he was astonished , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken :
BRG	Luke	5	10	And so was also James , and John , the sons of Zebedee , which were partners with Simon . And Jesus said unto Simon , Fear not ; from henceforth thou shalt catch men .
BRG	Luke	5	11	And when they had brought their ships to land , they forsook all , and followed him .

BRG	Luke	5	13	And he put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will : be thou clean . And immediately the leprosy departed from him .
BRG	Luke	5	14	And he charged him to tell no man : but go , and shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing , according as Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
BRG	Luke	5	15	But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him : and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed by him of their infirmities .
BRG	Luke	5	16	And he withdrew himself into the wilderness , and prayed .
BRG	Luke	5	17	And it came to pass on a certain day , as he was teaching , that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , which were come out of every town of Galilee , and Judaea , and Jerusalem : and the power of the Lord was present to heal them .
BRG	Luke	5	18	And , behold , men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy : and they sought means to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
BRG	Luke	5	19	And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude , they went upon the housetop , and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus .
BRG	Luke	5	20	And when he saw their faith , he said unto him , Man , thy sins are forgiven thee .
BRG	Luke	5	21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , Who is this which speaketh blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins , but God alone ?
BRG	Luke	5	22	But when Jesus perceived their thoughts , he answering said unto them , What reason ye in your hearts ?
BRG	Luke	5	23	Whether is easier , to say , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Rise up and walk ?
BRG	Luke	5	24	But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins , ( he said unto the sick of the palsy , ) I say unto thee , Arise , and take up thy couch , and go into thine house .

BRG	Luke	5	29	And Levi made him a great feast in his own house : and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them .
BRG	Luke	5	30	But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples , saying , Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners ?
BRG	Luke	5	31	And Jesus answering said unto them , They that are whole need not a physician ; but they that are sick .
BRG	Luke	5	32	I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
BRG	Luke	5	33	And they said unto him , Why do the disciples of John fast often , and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees ; but thine eat and drink ?
BRG	Luke	5	34	And he said unto them , Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
BRG	Luke	5	35	But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
BRG	Luke	5	36	And he spake also a parable unto them ; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old ; if otherwise , then both the new maketh a rent , and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old .
BRG	Luke	5	37	And no man putteth new wine into old bottles ; else the new wine will burst the bottles , and be spilled , and the bottles shall perish .
BRG	Luke	5	38	But new wine must be put into new bottles ; and both are preserved .

BRG	Luke	6	17	And he came down with them , and stood in the plain , and the company of his disciples , and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem , and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon , which came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases ;
BRG	Luke	6	18	And they that were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed .
BRG	Luke	6	19	And the whole multitude sought to touch him : for there went virtue out of him , and healed them all .
BRG	Luke	6	20	And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said , Blessed be ye poor : for your ’ s is the kingdom of God .
BRG	Luke	6	21	Blessed are ye that hunger now : for ye shall be filled . Blessed are ye that weep now : for ye shall laugh .
BRG	Luke	6	22	Blessed are ye , when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from their company , and shall reproach you , and cast out your name as evil , for the Son of man ’ s sake .
BRG	Luke	6	23	Rejoice ye in that day , and leap for joy : for , behold , your reward is great in heaven : for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets .
BRG	Luke	6	24	But woe unto you that are rich ! for ye have received your consolation .
BRG	Luke	6	25	Woe unto you that are full ! for ye shall hunger . Woe unto you that laugh now ! for ye shall mourn and weep .
BRG	Luke	6	26	Woe unto you , when all men shall speak well of you ! for so did their fathers to the false prophets .
BRG	Luke	6	27	But I say unto you which hear , Love your enemies , do good to them which hate you ,
BRG	Luke	6	28	Bless them that curse you , and pray for them which despitefully use you .
BRG	Luke	6	29	And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other ; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also .
BRG	Luke	6	30	Give to every man that asketh of thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again .
BRG	Luke	6	31	And as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise .
BRG	Luke	6	32	For if ye love them which love you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also love those that love them .
BRG	Luke	6	33	And if ye do good to them which do good to you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also do even the same .
BRG	Luke	6	34	And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive , what thank have ye ? for sinners also lend to sinners , to receive as much again .
BRG	Luke	6	35	But love ye your enemies , and do good , and lend , hoping for nothing again ; and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be the children of the Highest : for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil .
BRG	Luke	6	36	Be ye therefore merciful , as your Father also is merciful .
BRG	Luke	6	37	Judge not , and ye shall not be judged : condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned : forgive , and ye shall be forgiven :
BRG	Luke	6	38	Give , and it shall be given unto you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall men give into your bosom . For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again .
BRG	Luke	6	39	And he spake a parable unto them , Can the blind lead the blind ? shall they not both fall into the ditch ?
BRG	Luke	6	40	The disciple is not above his master : but every one that is perfect shall be as his master .
BRG	Luke	6	41	And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother ’ s eye , but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
BRG	Luke	6	42	Either how canst thou say to thy brother , Brother , let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye , when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? Thou hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine own eye , and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother ’ s eye .
BRG	Luke	6	43	For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit ; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
BRG	Luke	6	44	For every tree is known by his own fruit . For of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes .
BRG	Luke	6	45	A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good ; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil : for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh .
BRG	Luke	6	46	And why call ye me , Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ?
BRG	Luke	6	47	Whosoever cometh to me , and heareth my sayings , and doeth them , I will shew you to whom he is like :
BRG	Luke	6	48	He is like a man which built an house , and digged deep , and laid the foundation on a rock : and when the flood arose , the stream beat vehemently upon that house , and could not shake it : for it was founded upon a rock .
BRG	Luke	6	49	But he that heareth , and doeth not , is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth ; against which the stream did beat vehemently , and immediately it fell ; and the ruin of that house was great . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Luke	6	4145648	""
BRG	Luke	7	7	Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee : but say in a word , and my servant shall be healed .
BRG	Luke	7	2	And a certain centurion ’ s servant , who was dear unto him , was sick , and ready to die .
BRG	Luke	7	3	And when he heard of Jesus , he sent unto him the elders of the Jews , beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant .
BRG	Luke	7	4	And when they came to Jesus , they besought him instantly , saying , That he was worthy for whom he should do this :
BRG	Luke	7	5	For he loveth our nation , and he hath built us a synagogue .
BRG	Luke	7	6	Then Jesus went with them . And when he was now not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to him , saying unto him , Lord , trouble not thyself : for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof :
BRG	Luke	7	8	For I also am a man set under authority , having under me soldiers , and I say unto one , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doeth it .
BRG	Luke	7	9	When Jesus heard these things , he marvelled at him , and turned him about , and said unto the people that followed him , I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
BRG	Luke	7	10	And they that were sent , returning to the house , found the servant whole that had been sick .
BRG	Luke	7	11	And it came to pass the day after , that he went into a city called Nain ; and many of his disciples went with him , and much people .
BRG	Luke	7	12	Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city , behold , there was a dead man carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow : and much people of the city was with her .
BRG	Luke	7	13	And when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said unto her , Weep not .
BRG	Luke	7	14	And he came and touched the bier : and they that bare him stood still . And he said , Young man , I say unto thee , Arise .
BRG	Luke	7	15	And he that was dead sat up , and began to speak . And he delivered him to his mother .
BRG	Luke	7	16	And there came a fear on all : and they glorified God , saying , That a great prophet is risen up among us ; and , That God hath visited his people .
BRG	Luke	7	17	And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea , and throughout all the region round about .
BRG	Luke	7	18	And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things .
BRG	Luke	7	19	And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus , saying , Art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ?
BRG	Luke	7	20	When the men were come unto him , they said , John Baptist hath sent us unto thee , saying , Art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ?
BRG	Luke	7	21	And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues , and of evil spirits ; and unto many that were blind he gave sight .
BRG	Luke	7	22	Then Jesus answering said unto them , Go your way , and tell John what things ye have seen and heard ; how that the blind see , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , to the poor the gospel is preached .
BRG	Luke	7	23	And blessed is he , whosoever shall not be offended in me .
BRG	Luke	7	24	And when the messengers of John were departed , he began to speak unto the people concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness for to see ? A reed shaken with the wind ?
BRG	Luke	7	25	But what went ye out for to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? Behold , they which are gorgeously apparelled , and live delicately , are in kings ’ courts .
BRG	Luke	7	26	But what went ye out for to see ? A prophet ? Yea , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
BRG	Luke	7	27	This is he , of whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
BRG	Luke	7	28	For I say unto you , Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist : but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he .
BRG	Luke	7	29	And all the people that heard him , and the publicans , justified God , being baptized with the baptism of John .
BRG	Luke	7	30	But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves , being not baptized of him .
BRG	Luke	7	31	And the Lord said , Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation ? and to what are they like ?
BRG	Luke	7	32	They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace , and calling one to another , and saying , We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned to you , and ye have not wept .
BRG	Luke	7	33	For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine ; and ye say , He hath a devil .
BRG	Luke	7	34	The Son of man is come eating and drinking ; and ye say , Behold a gluttonous man , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners !
BRG	Luke	7	35	But wisdom is justified of all her children .
BRG	Luke	7	36	And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . And he went into the Pharisee ’ s house , and sat down to meat .
BRG	Luke	7	37	And , behold , a woman in the city , which was a sinner , when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee ’ s house , brought an alabaster box of ointment ,
BRG	Luke	7	38	And stood at his feet behind him weeping , and began to wash his feet with tears , and did wipe them with the hairs of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment .
BRG	Luke	7	39	Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it , he spake within himself , saying , This man , if he were a prophet , would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him : for she is a sinner .
BRG	Luke	7	40	And Jesus answering said unto him , Simon , I have somewhat to say unto thee . And he saith , Master , say on .
BRG	Luke	7	41	There was a certain creditor which had two debtors : the one owed five hundred pence , and the other fifty .
BRG	Luke	7	42	And when they had nothing to pay , he frankly forgave them both . Tell me therefore , which of them will love him most ?
BRG	Luke	7	43	Simon answered and said , I suppose that he , to whom he forgave most . And he said unto him , Thou hast rightly judged .
BRG	Luke	7	44	And he turned to the woman , and said unto Simon , Seest thou this woman ? I entered into thine house , thou gavest me no water for my feet : but she hath washed my feet with tears , and wiped them with the hairs of her head .
BRG	Luke	7	45	Thou gavest me no kiss : but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet .
BRG	Luke	7	46	My head with oil thou didst not anoint : but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment .
BRG	Luke	7	47	Wherefore I say unto thee , Her sins , which are many , are forgiven ; for she loved much : but to whom little is forgiven , the same loveth little .
BRG	Luke	7	48	And he said unto her , Thy sins are forgiven .
BRG	Luke	7	49	And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves , Who is this that forgiveth sins also ?
BRG	Luke	7	50	And he said to the woman , Thy faith hath saved thee ; go in peace . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Luke	8	8	And other fell on good ground , and sprang up , and bare fruit an hundredfold . And when he had said these things , he cried , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
BRG	Luke	8	2	And certain women , which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities , Mary called Magdalene , out of whom went seven devils ,
BRG	Luke	8	3	And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod ’ s steward , and Susanna , and many others , which ministered unto him of their substance .
BRG	Luke	8	4	And when much people were gathered together , and were come to him out of every city , he spake by a parable :
BRG	Luke	8	5	A sower went out to sow his seed : and as he sowed , some fell by the way side ; and it was trodden down , and the fowls of the air devoured it .
BRG	Luke	8	6	And some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moisture .
BRG	Luke	8	7	And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprang up with it , and choked it .
BRG	Luke	8	9	And his disciples asked him , saying , What might this parable be ?
BRG	Luke	8	10	And he said , Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God : but to others in parables ; that seeing they might not see , and hearing they might not understand .
BRG	Luke	8	11	Now the parable is this : The seed is the word of God .
BRG	Luke	8	12	Those by the way side are they that hear ; then cometh the devil , and taketh away the word out of their hearts , lest they should believe and be saved .
BRG	Luke	8	13	They on the rock are they , which , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; and these have no root , which for a while believe , and in time of temptation fall away .
BRG	Luke	8	14	And that which fell among thorns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection .
BRG	Luke	8	15	But that on the good ground are they , which in an honest and good heart , having heard the word , keep it , and bring forth fruit with patience .
BRG	Luke	8	16	No man , when he hath lighted a candle , covereth it with a vessel , or putteth it under a bed ; but setteth it on a candlestick , that they which enter in may see the light .
BRG	Luke	8	17	For nothing is secret , that shall not be made manifest ; neither any thing hid , that shall not be known and come abroad .
BRG	Luke	8	18	Take heed therefore how ye hear : for whosoever hath , to him shall be given ; and whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have .
BRG	Luke	8	19	Then came to him his mother and his brethren , and could not come at him for the press .
BRG	Luke	8	20	And it was told him by certain which said , Thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee .
BRG	Luke	8	21	And he answered and said unto them , My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God , and do it .
BRG	Luke	8	22	Now it came to pass on a certain day , that he went into a ship with his disciples : and he said unto them , Let us go over unto the other side of the lake . And they launched forth .
BRG	Luke	8	23	But as they sailed he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filled with water , and were in jeopardy .
BRG	Luke	8	24	And they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Master , master , we perish . Then he arose , and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water : and they ceased , and there was a calm .
BRG	Luke	8	25	And he said unto them , Where is your faith ? And they being afraid wondered , saying one to another , What manner of man is this ! for he commandeth even the winds and water , and they obey him .
BRG	Luke	8	26	And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes , which is over against Galilee .
BRG	Luke	8	27	And when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , which had devils long time , and ware no clothes , neither abode in any house , but in the tombs .
BRG	Luke	8	28	When he saw Jesus , he cried out , and fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God most high ? I beseech thee , torment me not .
BRG	Luke	8	29	( For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For oftentimes it had caught him : and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters ; and he brake the bands , and was driven of the devil into the wilderness . )
BRG	Luke	8	30	And Jesus asked him , saying , What is thy name ? And he said , Legion : because many devils were entered into him .
BRG	Luke	8	31	And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep .
BRG	Luke	8	32	And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain : and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them . And he suffered them .
BRG	Luke	8	33	Then went the devils out of the man , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake , and were choked .
BRG	Luke	8	34	When they that fed them saw what was done , they fled , and went and told it in the city and in the country .
BRG	Luke	8	35	Then they went out to see what was done ; and came to Jesus , and found the man , out of whom the devils were departed , sitting at the feet of Jesus , clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
BRG	Luke	8	36	They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed .
BRG	Luke	8	37	Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them ; for they were taken with great fear : and he went up into the ship , and returned back again .
BRG	Luke	8	38	Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him : but Jesus sent him away , saying ,
BRG	Luke	8	39	Return to thine own house , and shew how great things God hath done unto thee . And he went his way , and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him .
BRG	Luke	8	40	And it came to pass , that , when Jesus was returned , the people gladly received him : for they were all waiting for him .
BRG	Luke	8	41	And , behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at Jesus ’ feet , and besought him that he would come into his house :
BRG	Luke	8	42	For he had one only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she lay a dying . But as he went the people thronged him .
BRG	Luke	8	43	And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years , which had spent all her living upon physicians , neither could be healed of any ,
BRG	Luke	8	44	Came behind him , and touched the border of his garment : and immediately her issue of blood stanched .
BRG	Luke	8	45	And Jesus said , Who touched me ? When all denied , Peter and they that were with him said , Master , the multitude throng thee and press thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ?
BRG	Luke	8	46	And Jesus said , Somebody hath touched me : for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me .
BRG	Luke	8	47	And when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before him , she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him , and how she was healed immediately .
BRG	Luke	8	48	And he said unto her , Daughter , be of good comfort : thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace .
BRG	Luke	8	49	While he yet spake , there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue ’ s house , saying to him , Thy daughter is dead ; trouble not the Master .
BRG	Luke	8	50	But when Jesus heard it , he answered him , saying , Fear not : believe only , and she shall be made whole .
BRG	Luke	8	51	And when he came into the house , he suffered no man to go in , save Peter , and James , and John , and the father and the mother of the maiden .
BRG	Luke	8	52	And all wept , and bewailed her : but he said , Weep not ; she is not dead , but sleepeth .
BRG	Luke	8	53	And they laughed him to scorn , knowing that she was dead .
BRG	Luke	8	54	And he put them all out , and took her by the hand , and called , saying , Maid , arise .
BRG	Luke	8	55	And her spirit came again , and she arose straightway : and he commanded to give her meat .
BRG	Luke	8	56	And her parents were astonished : but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Luke	9	9	And Herod said , John have I beheaded : but who is this , of whom I hear such things ? And he desired to see him .
BRG	Luke	9	2	And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God , and to heal the sick .
BRG	Luke	9	3	And he said unto them , Take nothing for your journey , neither staves , nor scrip , neither bread , neither money ; neither have two coats apiece .
BRG	Luke	9	4	And whatsoever house ye enter into , there abide , and thence depart .
BRG	Luke	9	5	And whosoever will not receive you , when ye go out of that city , shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them .
BRG	Luke	9	6	And they departed , and went through the towns , preaching the gospel , and healing every where .
BRG	Luke	9	7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him : and he was perplexed , because that it was said of some , that John was risen from the dead ;
BRG	Luke	9	8	And of some , that Elias had appeared ; and of others , that one of the old prophets was risen again .
BRG	Luke	9	10	And the apostles , when they were returned , told him all that they had done . And he took them , and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida .
BRG	Luke	9	11	And the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and spake unto them of the kingdom of God , and healed them that had need of healing .
BRG	Luke	9	12	And when the day began to wear away , then came the twelve , and said unto him , Send the multitude away , that they may go into the towns and country round about , and lodge , and get victuals : for we are here in a desert place .
BRG	Luke	9	13	But he said unto them , Give ye them to eat . And they said , We have no more but five loaves and two fishes ; except we should go and buy meat for all this people .
BRG	Luke	9	14	For they were about five thousand men . And he said to his disciples , Make them sit down by fifties in a company .
BRG	Luke	9	15	And they did so , and made them all sit down .
BRG	Luke	9	16	Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude .
BRG	Luke	9	17	And they did eat , and were all filled : and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets .
BRG	Luke	9	18	And it came to pass , as he was alone praying , his disciples were with him : and he asked them , saying , Whom say the people that I am ?
BRG	Luke	9	19	They answering said , John the Baptist ; but some say , Elias ; and others say , that one of the old prophets is risen again .
BRG	Luke	9	20	He said unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? Peter answering said , The Christ of God .
BRG	Luke	9	21	And he straitly charged them , and commanded them to tell no man that thing ;
BRG	Luke	9	22	Saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be slain , and be raised the third day .
BRG	Luke	9	23	And he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
BRG	Luke	9	24	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it : but whosoever will lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it .
BRG	Luke	9	25	For what is a man advantaged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ?
BRG	Luke	9	26	For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he shall come in his own glory , and in his Father ’ s , and of the holy angels .
BRG	Luke	9	27	But I tell you of a truth , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the kingdom of God .
BRG	Luke	9	28	And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings , he took Peter and John and James , and went up into a mountain to pray .
BRG	Luke	9	29	And as he prayed , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment was white and glistering .
BRG	Luke	9	30	And , behold , there talked with him two men , which were Moses and Elias :
BRG	Luke	9	31	Who appeared in glory , and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem .
BRG	Luke	9	32	But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : and when they were awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him .
BRG	Luke	9	33	And it came to pass , as they departed from him , Peter said unto Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias : not knowing what he said .
BRG	Luke	9	34	While he thus spake , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them : and they feared as they entered into the cloud .
BRG	Luke	9	35	And there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him .
BRG	Luke	9	36	And when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone . And they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
BRG	Luke	9	37	And it came to pass , that on the next day , when they were come down from the hill , much people met him .
BRG	Luke	9	38	And , behold , a man of the company cried out , saying , Master , I beseech thee , look upon my son : for he is mine only child .
BRG	Luke	9	39	And , lo , a spirit taketh him , and he suddenly crieth out ; and it teareth him that he foameth again , and bruising him hardly departeth from him .
BRG	Luke	9	40	And I besought thy disciples to cast him out ; and they could not .
BRG	Luke	9	41	And Jesus answering said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you , and suffer you ? Bring thy son hither .
BRG	Luke	9	42	And as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
BRG	Luke	9	43	And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God . But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did , he said unto his disciples ,
BRG	Luke	9	44	Let these sayings sink down into your ears : for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men .
BRG	Luke	9	45	But they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them , that they perceived it not : and they feared to ask him of that saying .
BRG	Luke	9	46	Then there arose a reasoning among them , which of them should be greatest .
BRG	Luke	9	47	And Jesus , perceiving the thought of their heart , took a child , and set him by him ,
BRG	Luke	9	48	And said unto them , Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me : for he that is least among you all , the same shall be great .
BRG	Luke	9	49	And John answered and said , Master , we saw one casting out devils in thy name ; and we forbad him , because he followeth not with us .
BRG	Luke	9	50	And Jesus said unto him , Forbid him not : for he that is not against us is for us .
BRG	Luke	9	51	And it came to pass , when the time was come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem ,
BRG	Luke	9	52	And sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the Samaritans , to make ready for him .
BRG	Luke	9	53	And they did not receive him , because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem .
BRG	Luke	9	54	And when his disciples James and John saw this , they said , Lord , wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven , and consume them , even as Elias did ?
BRG	Luke	9	55	But he turned , and rebuked them , and said , Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of .
BRG	Luke	9	56	For the Son of man is not come to destroy men ’ s lives , but to save them . And they went to another village .
BRG	Luke	9	57	And it came to pass , that , as they went in the way , a certain man said unto him , Lord , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
BRG	Luke	9	58	And Jesus said unto him , Foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
BRG	Luke	9	59	And he said unto another , Follow me . But he said , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
BRG	Luke	9	60	Jesus said unto him , Let the dead bury their dead : but go thou and preach the kingdom of God .
BRG	Luke	9	61	And another also said , Lord , I will follow thee ; but let me first go bid them farewell , which are at home at my house .
BRG	Luke	9	62	And Jesus said unto him , No man , having put his hand to the plough , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Luke	10	10	But into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you not , go your ways out into the streets of the same , and say ,
BRG	Luke	10	2	Therefore said he unto them , The harvest truly is great , but the labourers are few : pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he would send forth labourers into his harvest .
BRG	Luke	10	3	Go your ways : behold , I send you forth as lambs among wolves .
BRG	Luke	10	4	Carry neither purse , nor scrip , nor shoes : and salute no man by the way .
BRG	Luke	10	5	And into whatsoever house ye enter , first say , Peace be to this house .
BRG	Luke	10	6	And if the son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon it : if not , it shall turn to you again .
BRG	Luke	10	7	And in the same house remain , eating and drinking such things as they give : for the labourer is worthy of his hire . Go not from house to house .
BRG	Luke	10	8	And into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you :
BRG	Luke	10	9	And heal the sick that are therein , and say unto them , The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you .
BRG	Luke	10	11	Even the very dust of your city , which cleaveth on us , we do wipe off against you : notwithstanding be ye sure of this , that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you .
BRG	Luke	10	12	But I say unto you , that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom , than for that city .
BRG	Luke	10	13	Woe unto thee , Chorazin ! woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon , which have been done in you , they had a great while ago repented , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
BRG	Luke	10	14	But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment , than for you .
BRG	Luke	10	15	And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted to heaven , shalt be thrust down to hell .
BRG	Luke	10	16	He that heareth you heareth me ; and he that despiseth you despiseth me ; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me .
BRG	Luke	10	17	And the seventy returned again with joy , saying , Lord , even the devils are subject unto us through thy name .
BRG	Luke	10	18	And he said unto them , I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven .
BRG	Luke	10	19	Behold , I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
BRG	Luke	10	20	Notwithstanding in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subject unto you ; but rather rejoice , because your names are written in heaven .
BRG	Luke	10	21	In that hour Jesus rejoiced in Spirit , and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes : even so , Father ; for so it seemed good in thy sight .
BRG	Luke	10	22	All things are delivered to me of my Father : and no man knoweth who the Son is , but the Father ; and who the Father is , but the Son , and he to whom the Son will reveal him .
BRG	Luke	10	23	And he turned him unto his disciples , and said privately , Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see :
BRG	Luke	10	24	For I tell you , that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
BRG	Luke	10	25	And , behold , a certain lawyer stood up , and tempted him , saying , Master , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ?
BRG	Luke	10	26	He said unto him , What is written in the law ? how readest thou ?
BRG	Luke	10	27	And he answering said , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thy mind ; and thy neighbour as thyself .
BRG	Luke	10	28	And he said unto him , Thou hast answered right : this do , and thou shalt live .
BRG	Luke	10	29	But he , willing to justify himself , said unto Jesus , And who is my neighbour ?
BRG	Luke	10	30	And Jesus answering said , A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell among thieves , which stripped him of his raiment , and wounded him , and departed , leaving him half dead .
BRG	Luke	10	31	And by chance there came down a certain priest that way : and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
BRG	Luke	10	32	And likewise a Levite , when he was at the place , came and looked on him , and passed by on the other side .
BRG	Luke	10	33	But a certain Samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was : and when he saw him , he had compassion on him ,
BRG	Luke	10	34	And went to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine , and set him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
BRG	Luke	10	35	And on the morrow when he departed , he took out two pence , and gave them to the host , and said unto him , Take care of him ; and whatsoever thou spendest more , when I come again , I will repay thee .
BRG	Luke	10	36	Which now of these three , thinkest thou , was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves ?
BRG	Luke	10	37	And he said , He that shewed mercy on him . Then said Jesus unto him , Go , and do thou likewise .
BRG	Luke	10	38	Now it came to pass , as they went , that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house .
BRG	Luke	10	39	And she had a sister called Mary , which also sat at Jesus ’ feet , and heard his word .
BRG	Luke	10	40	But Martha was cumbered about much serving , and came to him , and said , Lord , dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone ? bid her therefore that she help me .
BRG	Luke	10	41	And Jesus answered and said unto her , Martha , Martha , thou art careful and troubled about many things :
BRG	Luke	10	42	But one thing is needful : and Mary hath chosen that good part , which shall not be taken away from her . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Luke	11	11	If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ? or if he ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a serpent ?
BRG	Luke	11	2	And he said unto them , When ye pray , say , Our Father which art in heaven , Hallowed be thy name . Thy kingdom come . Thy will be done , as in heaven , so in earth .
BRG	Luke	11	3	Give us day by day our daily bread .
BRG	Luke	11	4	And forgive us our sins ; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us . And lead us not into temptation ; but deliver us from evil .
BRG	Luke	11	5	And he said unto them , Which of you shall have a friend , and shall go unto him at midnight , and say unto him , Friend , lend me three loaves ;
BRG	Luke	11	6	For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me , and I have nothing to set before him ?
BRG	Luke	11	7	And he from within shall answer and say , Trouble me not : the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed ; I can not rise and give thee .
BRG	Luke	11	8	I say unto you , Though he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend , yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth .
BRG	Luke	11	9	And I say unto you , Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you .
BRG	Luke	11	10	For every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
BRG	Luke	11	12	Or if he shall ask an egg , will he offer him a scorpion ?
BRG	Luke	11	13	If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children : how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him ?
BRG	Luke	11	14	And he was casting out a devil , and it was dumb . And it came to pass , when the devil was gone out , the dumb spake ; and the people wondered .
BRG	Luke	11	15	But some of them said , He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils .
BRG	Luke	11	16	And others , tempting him , sought of him a sign from heaven .
BRG	Luke	11	17	But he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house divided against a house falleth .
BRG	Luke	11	18	If Satan also be divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub .
BRG	Luke	11	19	And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges .
BRG	Luke	11	20	But if I with the finger of God cast out devils , no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you .
BRG	Luke	11	21	When a strong man armed keepeth his palace , his goods are in peace :
BRG	Luke	11	22	But when a stronger than he shall come upon him , and overcome him , he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted , and divideth his spoils .
BRG	Luke	11	23	He that is not with me is against me : and he that gathereth not with me scattereth .
BRG	Luke	11	24	When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he saith , I will return unto my house whence I came out .
BRG	Luke	11	25	And when he cometh , he findeth it swept and garnished .
BRG	Luke	11	26	Then goeth he , and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
BRG	Luke	11	27	And it came to pass , as he spake these things , a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice , and said unto him , Blessed is the womb that bare thee , and the paps which thou hast sucked .
BRG	Luke	11	28	But he said , Yea rather , blessed are they that hear the word of God , and keep it .
BRG	Luke	11	29	And when the people were gathered thick together , he began to say , This is an evil generation : they seek a sign ; and there shall no sign be given it , but the sign of Jonas the prophet .
BRG	Luke	11	30	For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites , so shall also the Son of man be to this generation .
BRG	Luke	11	31	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and condemn them : for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and , behold , a greater than Solomon is here .
BRG	Luke	11	32	The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and , behold , a greater than Jonas is here .
BRG	Luke	11	33	No man , when he hath lighted a candle , putteth it in a secret place , neither under a bushel , but on a candlestick , that they which come in may see the light .
BRG	Luke	11	34	The light of the body is the eye : therefore when thine eye is single , thy whole body also is full of light ; but when thine eye is evil , thy body also is full of darkness .
BRG	Luke	11	35	Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness .
BRG	Luke	11	36	If thy whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light , as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light .
BRG	Luke	11	37	And as he spake , a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat .
BRG	Luke	11	38	And when the Pharisee saw it , he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner .
BRG	Luke	11	39	And the Lord said unto him , Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter ; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness .
BRG	Luke	11	40	Ye fools , did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also ?
BRG	Luke	11	41	But rather give alms of such things as ye have ; and , behold , all things are clean unto you .
BRG	Luke	11	42	But woe unto you , Pharisees ! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs , and pass over judgment and the love of God : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
BRG	Luke	11	43	Woe unto you , Pharisees ! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues , and greetings in the markets .
BRG	Luke	11	44	Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them are not aware of them .
BRG	Luke	11	45	Then answered one of the lawyers , and said unto him , Master , thus saying thou reproachest us also .
BRG	Luke	11	46	And he said , Woe unto you also , ye lawyers ! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers .
BRG	Luke	11	47	Woe unto you ! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
BRG	Luke	11	48	Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers : for they indeed killed them , and ye build their sepulchres .
BRG	Luke	11	49	Therefore also said the wisdom of God , I will send them prophets and apostles , and some of them they shall slay and persecute :
BRG	Luke	11	50	That the blood of all the prophets , which was shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ;
BRG	Luke	11	51	From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias , which perished between the altar and the temple : verily I say unto you , It shall be required of this generation .
BRG	Luke	11	52	Woe unto you , lawyers ! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge : ye entered not in yourselves , and them that were entering in ye hindered .
BRG	Luke	11	53	And as he said these things unto them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently , and to provoke him to speak of many things :

BRG	Luke	12	12	For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say .
BRG	Luke	12	2	For there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; neither hid , that shall not be known .
BRG	Luke	12	3	Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light ; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops .
BRG	Luke	12	4	And I say unto you my friends , Be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
BRG	Luke	12	5	But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear : Fear him , which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell ; yea , I say unto you , Fear him .
BRG	Luke	12	6	Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings , and not one of them is forgotten before God ?
BRG	Luke	12	7	But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many sparrows .
BRG	Luke	12	8	Also I say unto you , Whosoever shall confess me before men , him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God :
BRG	Luke	12	9	But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God .
BRG	Luke	12	10	And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven .
BRG	Luke	12	11	And when they bring you unto the synagogues , and unto magistrates , and powers , take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer , or what ye shall say :
BRG	Luke	12	13	And one of the company said unto him , Master , speak to my brother , that he divide the inheritance with me .
BRG	Luke	12	14	And he said unto him , Man , who made me a judge or a divider over you ?
BRG	Luke	12	15	And he said unto them , Take heed , and beware of covetousness : for a man ’ s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth . ( A )
BRG	Luke	12	16	And he spake a parable unto them , saying , The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully :
BRG	Luke	12	17	And he thought within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have no room where to bestow my fruits ?
BRG	Luke	12	18	And he said , This will I do : I will pull down my barns , and build greater ; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods .
BRG	Luke	12	19	And I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years ; take thine ease , eat , drink , and be merry .
BRG	Luke	12	20	But God said unto him , Thou fool , this night thy soul shall be required of thee : then whose shall those things be , which thou hast provided ?
BRG	Luke	12	21	So is he that layeth up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God .
BRG	Luke	12	22	And he said unto his disciples , Therefore I say unto you , Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat ; neither for the body , what ye shall put on .
BRG	Luke	12	23	The life is more than meat , and the body is more than raiment .
BRG	Luke	12	24	Consider the ravens : for they neither sow nor reap ; which neither have storehouse nor barn ; and God feedeth them : how much more are ye better than the fowls ?
BRG	Luke	12	25	And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit ?
BRG	Luke	12	26	If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least , why take ye thought for the rest ?
BRG	Luke	12	27	Consider the lilies how they grow : they toil not , they spin not ; and yet I say unto you , that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
BRG	Luke	12	28	If then God so clothe the grass , which is to day in the field , and to morrow is cast into the oven ; how much more will he clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
BRG	Luke	12	29	And seek not ye what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doubtful mind .
BRG	Luke	12	30	For all these things do the nations of the world seek after : and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things .
BRG	Luke	12	31	But rather seek ye the kingdom of God ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
BRG	Luke	12	32	Fear not , little flock ; for it is your Father ’ s good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
BRG	Luke	12	33	Sell that ye have , and give alms ; provide yourselves bags which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief approacheth , neither moth corrupteth .
BRG	Luke	12	34	For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
BRG	Luke	12	35	Let your loins be girded about , and your lights burning ;
BRG	Luke	12	36	And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; that when he cometh and knocketh , they may open unto him immediately .
BRG	Luke	12	37	Blessed are those servants , whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching : verily I say unto you , that he shall gird himself , and make them to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them .
BRG	Luke	12	38	And if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those servants .
BRG	Luke	12	39	And this know , that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through .
BRG	Luke	12	40	Be ye therefore ready also : for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not . ( B )
BRG	Luke	12	41	Then Peter said unto him , Lord , speakest thou this parable unto us , or even to all ?
BRG	Luke	12	42	And the Lord said , Who then is that faithful and wise steward , whom his lord shall make ruler over his household , to give them their portion of meat in due season ?
BRG	Luke	12	43	Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
BRG	Luke	12	44	Of a truth I say unto you , that he will make him ruler over all that he hath .
BRG	Luke	12	45	But and if that servant say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ;
BRG	Luke	12	46	The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him , and at an hour when he is not aware , and will cut him in sunder , and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers .
BRG	Luke	12	47	And that servant , which knew his lord ’ s will , and prepared not himself , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes .
BRG	Luke	12	48	But he that knew not , and did commit things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few stripes . For unto whomsoever much is given , of him shall be much required : and to whom men have committed much , of him they will ask the more .
BRG	Luke	12	49	I am come to send fire on the earth ; and what will I , if it be already kindled ?
BRG	Luke	12	50	But I have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished !
BRG	Luke	12	51	Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth ? I tell you , Nay ; but rather division :
BRG	Luke	12	52	For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three .
BRG	Luke	12	53	The father shall be divided against the son , and the son against the father ; the mother against the daughter , and the daughter against the mother ; the mother in law against her daughter in law , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
BRG	Luke	12	54	And he said also to the people , When ye see a cloud rise out of the west , straightway ye say , There cometh a shower ; and so it is .
BRG	Luke	12	55	And when ye see the south wind blow , ye say , There will be heat ; and it cometh to pass .
BRG	Luke	12	56	Ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth ; but how is it that ye do not discern this time ?
BRG	Luke	12	57	Yea , and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ?
BRG	Luke	12	58	When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate , as thou art in the way , give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him ; lest he hale thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and the officer cast thee into prison .

BRG	Luke	13	3	I tell you , Nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish .

BRG	Luke	13	7	Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard , Behold , these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree , and find none : cut it down ; why cumbereth it the ground ?
BRG	Luke	13	8	And he answering said unto him , Lord , let it alone this year also , till I shall dig about it , and dung it :
BRG	Luke	13	9	And if it bear fruit , well : and if not , then after that thou shalt cut it down .
BRG	Luke	13	10	And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath .
BRG	Luke	13	11	And , behold , there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and was bowed together , and could in no wise lift up herself .
BRG	Luke	13	12	And when Jesus saw her , he called her to him , and said unto her , Woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity .
BRG	Luke	13	14	And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation , because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day , and said unto the people , There are six days in which men ought to work : in them therefore come and be healed , and not on the sabbath day .
BRG	Luke	13	15	The Lord then answered him , and said , Thou hypocrite , doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall , and lead him away to watering ?
BRG	Luke	13	16	And ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan hath bound , lo , these eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day ?
BRG	Luke	13	17	And when he had said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
BRG	Luke	13	18	Then said he , Unto what is the kingdom of God like ? and whereunto shall I resemble it ?
BRG	Luke	13	19	It is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and cast into his garden ; and it grew , and waxed a great tree ; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it .
BRG	Luke	13	20	And again he said , Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God ?
BRG	Luke	13	21	It is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
BRG	Luke	13	22	And he went through the cities and villages , teaching , and journeying toward Jerusalem .

BRG	Luke	13	31	The same day there came certain of the Pharisees , saying unto him , Get thee out , and depart hence : for Herod will kill thee .
BRG	Luke	13	32	And he said unto them , Go ye , and tell that fox , Behold , I cast out devils , and I do cures to day and to morrow , and the third day I shall be perfected .
BRG	Luke	13	33	Nevertheless I must walk to day , and to morrow , and the day following : for it can not be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem .
BRG	Luke	13	34	O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , which killest the prophets , and stonest them that are sent unto thee ; how often would I have gathered thy children together , as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings , and ye would not !

BRG	Luke	14	14	And thou shalt be blessed ; for they can not recompense thee : for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just .
BRG	Luke	14	2	And , behold , there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy .
BRG	Luke	14	3	And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ?
BRG	Luke	14	4	And they held their peace . And he took him , and healed him , and let him go ;
BRG	Luke	14	5	And answered them , saying , Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day ?
BRG	Luke	14	6	And they could not answer him again to these things .
BRG	Luke	14	7	And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden , when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms ; saying unto them ,
BRG	Luke	14	8	When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding , sit not down in the highest room ; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him ;
BRG	Luke	14	9	And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee , Give this man place ; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room .
BRG	Luke	14	10	But when thou art bidden , go and sit down in the lowest room ; that when he that bade thee cometh , he may say unto thee , Friend , go up higher : then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee .
BRG	Luke	14	11	For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
BRG	Luke	14	12	Then said he also to him that bade him , When thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends , nor thy brethren , neither thy kinsmen , nor thy rich neighbours ; lest they also bid thee again , and a recompence be made thee .
BRG	Luke	14	13	But when thou makest a feast , call the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind :
BRG	Luke	14	15	And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things , he said unto him , Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God .
BRG	Luke	14	16	Then said he unto him , A certain man made a great supper , and bade many :
BRG	Luke	14	17	And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden , Come ; for all things are now ready .
BRG	Luke	14	18	And they all with one consent began to make excuse . The first said unto him , I have bought a piece of ground , and I must needs go and see it : I pray thee have me excused .
BRG	Luke	14	19	And another said , I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to prove them : I pray thee have me excused .
BRG	Luke	14	20	And another said , I have married a wife , and therefore I can not come .
BRG	Luke	14	21	So that servant came , and shewed his lord these things . Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant , Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in hither the poor , and the maimed , and the halt , and the blind .
BRG	Luke	14	22	And the servant said , Lord , it is done as thou hast commanded , and yet there is room .
BRG	Luke	14	23	And the lord said unto the servant , Go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled .
BRG	Luke	14	24	For I say unto you , That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper .
BRG	Luke	14	25	And there went great multitudes with him : and he turned , and said unto them ,
BRG	Luke	14	26	If any man come to me , and hate not his father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brethren , and sisters , yea , and his own life also , he can not be my disciple .
BRG	Luke	14	27	And whosoever doth not bear his cross , and come after me , can not be my disciple .
BRG	Luke	14	28	For which of you , intending to build a tower , sitteth not down first , and counteth the cost , whether he have sufficient to finish it ?
BRG	Luke	14	29	Lest haply , after he hath laid the foundation , and is not able to finish it , all that behold it begin to mock him ,
BRG	Luke	14	30	Saying , This man began to build , and was not able to finish .
BRG	Luke	14	31	Or what king , going to make war against another king , sitteth not down first , and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand ?
BRG	Luke	14	32	Or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and desireth conditions of peace .
BRG	Luke	14	33	So likewise , whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath , he can not be my disciple .
BRG	Luke	14	34	Salt is good : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be seasoned ?
BRG	Luke	14	35	It is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the dunghill ; but men cast it out . He that hath ears to hear , let him hear . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Luke	15	15	And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country ; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine .
BRG	Luke	15	2	And the Pharisees and scribes murmured , saying , This man receiveth sinners , and eateth with them .
BRG	Luke	15	3	And he spake this parable unto them , saying ,
BRG	Luke	15	4	What man of you , having an hundred sheep , if he lose one of them , doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness , and go after that which is lost , until he find it ?
BRG	Luke	15	5	And when he hath found it , he layeth it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
BRG	Luke	15	6	And when he cometh home , he calleth together his friends and neighbours , saying unto them , Rejoice with me ; for I have found my sheep which was lost .
BRG	Luke	15	7	I say unto you , that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth , more than over ninety and nine just persons , which need no repentance .
BRG	Luke	15	8	Either what woman having ten pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , doth not light a candle , and sweep the house , and seek diligently till she find it ?
BRG	Luke	15	9	And when she hath found it , she calleth her friends and her neighbours together , saying , Rejoice with me ; for I have found the piece which I had lost .
BRG	Luke	15	10	Likewise , I say unto you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth .
BRG	Luke	15	11	And he said , A certain man had two sons :
BRG	Luke	15	12	And the younger of them said to his father , Father , give me the portion of goods that falleth to me . And he divided unto them his living .
BRG	Luke	15	13	And not many days after the younger son gathered all together , and took his journey into a far country , and there wasted his substance with riotous living .
BRG	Luke	15	14	And when he had spent all , there arose a mighty famine in that land ; and he began to be in want .
BRG	Luke	15	16	And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him .
BRG	Luke	15	17	And when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father ’ s have bread enough and to spare , and I perish with hunger !
BRG	Luke	15	18	I will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and before thee ,
BRG	Luke	15	19	And am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
BRG	Luke	15	20	And he arose , and came to his father . But when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him .
BRG	Luke	15	21	And the son said unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight , and am no more worthy to be called thy son .
BRG	Luke	15	22	But the father said to his servants , Bring forth the best robe , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet :
BRG	Luke	15	23	And bring hither the fatted calf , and kill it ; and let us eat , and be merry :
BRG	Luke	15	24	For this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . And they began to be merry .
BRG	Luke	15	25	Now his elder son was in the field : and as he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard musick and dancing .
BRG	Luke	15	26	And he called one of the servants , and asked what these things meant .
BRG	Luke	15	27	And he said unto him , Thy brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe and sound .
BRG	Luke	15	28	And he was angry , and would not go in : therefore came his father out , and intreated him .
BRG	Luke	15	29	And he answering said to his father , Lo , these many years do I serve thee , neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment : and yet thou never gavest me a kid , that I might make merry with my friends :

BRG	Luke	16	16	The law and the prophets were until John : since that time the kingdom of God is preached , and every man presseth into it .
BRG	Luke	16	2	And he called him , and said unto him , How is it that I hear this of thee ? give an account of thy stewardship ; for thou mayest be no longer steward .
BRG	Luke	16	3	Then the steward said within himself , What shall I do ? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship : I can not dig ; to beg I am ashamed .
BRG	Luke	16	4	I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
BRG	Luke	16	5	So he called every one of his lord ’ s debtors unto him , and said unto the first , How much owest thou unto my lord ?
BRG	Luke	16	6	And he said , An hundred measures of oil . And he said unto him , Take thy bill , and sit down quickly , and write fifty .
BRG	Luke	16	7	Then said he to another , And how much owest thou ? And he said , An hundred measures of wheat . And he said unto him , Take thy bill , and write fourscore .
BRG	Luke	16	8	And the lord commended the unjust steward , because he had done wisely : for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light .
BRG	Luke	16	9	And I say unto you , Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness ; that , when ye fail , they may receive you into everlasting habitations .
BRG	Luke	16	10	He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much : and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much .
BRG	Luke	16	11	If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
BRG	Luke	16	12	And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man ’ s , who shall give you that which is your own ?
BRG	Luke	16	13	No servant can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . Ye can not serve God and mammon .
BRG	Luke	16	14	And the Pharisees also , who were covetous , heard all these things : and they derided him .
BRG	Luke	16	15	And he said unto them , Ye are they which justify yourselves before men ; but God knoweth your hearts : for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God .
BRG	Luke	16	17	And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass , than one tittle of the law to fail .
BRG	Luke	16	18	Whosoever putteth away his wife , and marrieth another , committeth adultery : and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery .
BRG	Luke	16	19	There was a certain rich man , which was clothed in purple and fine linen , and fared sumptuously every day :
BRG	Luke	16	20	And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus , which was laid at his gate , full of sores ,
BRG	Luke	16	21	And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man ’ s table : moreover the dogs came and licked his sores .
BRG	Luke	16	22	And it came to pass , that the beggar died , and was carried by the angels into Abraham ’ s bosom : the rich man also died , and was buried ;
BRG	Luke	16	23	And in hell he lift up his eyes , being in torments , and seeth Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom .
BRG	Luke	16	24	And he cried and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ; for I am tormented in this flame .
BRG	Luke	16	25	But Abraham said , Son , remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things , and likewise Lazarus evil things : but now he is comforted , and thou art tormented .
BRG	Luke	16	26	And beside all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed : so that they which would pass from hence to you can not ; neither can they pass to us , that would come from thence .
BRG	Luke	16	27	Then he said , I pray thee therefore , father , that thou wouldest send him to my father ’ s house :
BRG	Luke	16	28	For I have five brethren ; that he may testify unto them , lest they also come into this place of torment .
BRG	Luke	16	29	Abraham saith unto him , They have Moses and the prophets ; let them hear them .
BRG	Luke	16	30	And he said , Nay , father Abraham : but if one went unto them from the dead , they will repent .
BRG	Luke	16	31	And he said unto him , If they hear not Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded , though one rose from the dead . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Luke	17	17	And Jesus answering said , Were there not ten cleansed ? but where are the nine ?
BRG	Luke	17	2	It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he cast into the sea , than that he should offend one of these little ones .
BRG	Luke	17	3	Take heed to yourselves : If thy brother trespass against thee , rebuke him ; and if he repent , forgive him .
BRG	Luke	17	4	And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to thee , saying , I repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
BRG	Luke	17	5	And the apostles said unto the Lord , Increase our faith .
BRG	Luke	17	6	And the Lord said , If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye might say unto this sycamine tree , Be thou plucked up by the root , and be thou planted in the sea ; and it should obey you .
BRG	Luke	17	7	But which of you , having a servant plowing or feeding cattle , will say unto him by and by , when he is come from the field , Go and sit down to meat ?
BRG	Luke	17	8	And will not rather say unto him , Make ready wherewith I may sup , and gird thyself , and serve me , till I have eaten and drunken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ?

BRG	Luke	17	10	So likewise ye , when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you , say , We are unprofitable servants : we have done that which was our duty to do .
BRG	Luke	17	11	And it came to pass , as he went to Jerusalem , that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee .
BRG	Luke	17	12	And as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , which stood afar off :
BRG	Luke	17	13	And they lifted up their voices , and said , Jesus , Master , have mercy on us .
BRG	Luke	17	14	And when he saw them , he said unto them , Go shew yourselves unto the priests . And it came to pass , that , as they went , they were cleansed .
BRG	Luke	17	15	And one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , and with a loud voice glorified God ,
BRG	Luke	17	16	And fell down on his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a Samaritan .
BRG	Luke	17	18	There are not found that returned to give glory to God , save this stranger .
BRG	Luke	17	19	And he said unto him , Arise , go thy way : thy faith hath made thee whole .
BRG	Luke	17	20	And when he was demanded of the Pharisees , when the kingdom of God should come , he answered them and said , The kingdom of God cometh not with observation :
BRG	Luke	17	21	Neither shall they say , Lo here ! or , lo there ! for , behold , the kingdom of God is within you .
BRG	Luke	17	22	And he said unto the disciples , The days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , and ye shall not see it .
BRG	Luke	17	23	And they shall say to you , See here ; or , see there : go not after them , nor follow them .
BRG	Luke	17	24	For as the lightning , that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day .
BRG	Luke	17	25	But first must he suffer many things , and be rejected of this generation .
BRG	Luke	17	26	And as it was in the days of Noe , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man .

BRG	Luke	18	3	And there was a widow in that city ; and she came unto him , saying , Avenge me of mine adversary .
BRG	Luke	18	4	And he would not for a while : but afterward he said within himself , Though I fear not God , nor regard man ;
BRG	Luke	18	5	Yet because this widow troubleth me , I will avenge her , lest by her continual coming she weary me .
BRG	Luke	18	6	And the Lord said , Hear what the unjust judge saith .

BRG	Luke	18	8	I tell you that he will avenge them speedily . Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ?
BRG	Luke	18	9	And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and despised others :
BRG	Luke	18	10	Two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a Pharisee , and the other a publican .
BRG	Luke	18	11	The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , God , I thank thee , that I am not as other men are , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this publican .
BRG	Luke	18	12	I fast twice in the week , I give tithes of all that I possess .
BRG	Luke	18	13	And the publican , standing afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , God be merciful to me a sinner .
BRG	Luke	18	14	I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
BRG	Luke	18	15	And they brought unto him also infants , that he would touch them : but when his disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
BRG	Luke	18	16	But Jesus called them unto him , and said , Suffer little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God .
BRG	Luke	18	17	Verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein .
BRG	Luke	18	19	And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? none is good , save one , that is , God .
BRG	Luke	18	20	Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honour thy father and thy mother .
BRG	Luke	18	21	And he said , All these have I kept from my youth up .
BRG	Luke	18	22	Now when Jesus heard these things , he said unto him , Yet lackest thou one thing : sell all that thou hast , and distribute unto the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me .
BRG	Luke	18	23	And when he heard this , he was very sorrowful : for he was very rich .
BRG	Luke	18	24	And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful , he said , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
BRG	Luke	18	25	For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle ’ s eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
BRG	Luke	18	26	And they that heard it said , Who then can be saved ?

BRG	Luke	18	30	Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time , and in the world to come life everlasting .
BRG	Luke	18	31	Then he took unto him the twelve , and said unto them , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished .
BRG	Luke	18	32	For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles , and shall be mocked , and spitefully entreated , and spitted on :
BRG	Luke	18	33	And they shall scourge him , and put him to death : and the third day he shall rise again .

BRG	Luke	18	35	And it came to pass , that as he was come nigh unto Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the way side begging :

BRG	Luke	19	11	And as they heard these things , he added and spake a parable , because he was nigh to Jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear .
BRG	Luke	19	12	He said therefore , A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
BRG	Luke	19	13	And he called his ten servants , and delivered them ten pounds , and said unto them , Occupy till I come .
BRG	Luke	19	14	But his citizens hated him , and sent a message after him , saying , We will not have this man to reign over us .
BRG	Luke	19	15	And it came to pass , that when he was returned , having received the kingdom , then he commanded these servants to be called unto him , to whom he had given the money , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading .
BRG	Luke	19	16	Then came the first , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained ten pounds .
BRG	Luke	19	17	And he said unto him , Well , thou good servant : because thou hast been faithful in a very little , have thou authority over ten cities .
BRG	Luke	19	18	And the second came , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained five pounds .
BRG	Luke	19	20	And another came , saying , Lord , behold , here is thy pound , which I have kept laid up in a napkin :
BRG	Luke	19	21	For I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up that thou layedst not down , and reapest that thou didst not sow .
BRG	Luke	19	22	And he saith unto him , Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee , thou wicked servant . Thou knewest that I was an austere man , taking up that I laid not down , and reaping that I did not sow :
BRG	Luke	19	23	Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank , that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury ?
BRG	Luke	19	24	And he said unto them that stood by , Take from him the pound , and give it to him that hath ten pounds .
BRG	Luke	19	25	( And they said unto him , Lord , he hath ten pounds . )
BRG	Luke	19	26	For I say unto you , That unto every one which hath shall be given ; and from him that hath not , even that he hath shall be taken away from him .
BRG	Luke	19	27	But those mine enemies , which would not that I should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me .
BRG	Luke	19	28	And when he had thus spoken , he went before , ascending up to Jerusalem .
BRG	Luke	19	29	And it came to pass , when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount called the mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples ,
BRG	Luke	19	30	Saying , Go ye into the village over against you ; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied , whereon yet never man sat : loose him , and bring him hither .
BRG	Luke	19	31	And if any man ask you , Why do ye loose him ? thus shall ye say unto him , Because the Lord hath need of him .
BRG	Luke	19	32	And they that were sent went their way , and found even as he had said unto them .
BRG	Luke	19	33	And as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said unto them , Why loose ye the colt ?
BRG	Luke	19	34	And they said , The Lord hath need of him .
BRG	Luke	19	35	And they brought him to Jesus : and they cast their garments upon the colt , and they set Jesus thereon .
BRG	Luke	19	36	And as he went , they spread their clothes in the way .
BRG	Luke	19	37	And when he was come nigh , even now at the descent of the mount of Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen ;
BRG	Luke	19	38	Saying , Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest .
BRG	Luke	19	39	And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him , Master , rebuke thy disciples .
BRG	Luke	19	40	And he answered and said unto them , I tell you that , if these should hold their peace , the stones would immediately cry out .
BRG	Luke	19	41	And when he was come near , he beheld the city , and wept over it ,
BRG	Luke	19	42	Saying , If thou hadst known , even thou , at least in this thy day , the things which belong unto thy peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes .
BRG	Luke	19	43	For the days shall come upon thee , that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and compass thee round , and keep thee in on every side ,
BRG	Luke	19	44	And shall lay thee even with the ground , and thy children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation .
BRG	Luke	19	45	And he went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold therein , and them that bought ;
BRG	Luke	19	46	Saying unto them , It is written , My house is the house of prayer : but ye have made it a den of thieves .
BRG	Luke	19	47	And he taught daily in the temple . But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him ,
BRG	Luke	19	48	And could not find what they might do : for all the people were very attentive to hear him . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Luke	20	20	And they watched him , and sent forth spies , which should feign themselves just men , that they might take hold of his words , that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor .
BRG	Luke	20	2	And spake unto him , saying , Tell us , by what authority doest thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ?
BRG	Luke	20	3	And he answered and said unto them , I will also ask you one thing ; and answer me :
BRG	Luke	20	4	The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or of men ?
BRG	Luke	20	5	And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then believed ye him not ?
BRG	Luke	20	6	But and if we say , Of men ; all the people will stone us : for they be persuaded that John was a prophet .
BRG	Luke	20	7	And they answered , that they could not tell whence it was .
BRG	Luke	20	8	And Jesus said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things .
BRG	Luke	20	9	Then began he to speak to the people this parable ; A certain man planted a vineyard , and let it forth to husbandmen , and went into a far country for a long time .
BRG	Luke	20	10	And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the husbandmen beat him , and sent him away empty .
BRG	Luke	20	11	And again he sent another servant : and they beat him also , and entreated him shamefully , and sent him away empty .
BRG	Luke	20	12	And again he sent a third : and they wounded him also , and cast him out .
BRG	Luke	20	13	Then said the lord of the vineyard , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son : it may be they will reverence him when they see him .
BRG	Luke	20	14	But when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir : come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be our ’ s .
BRG	Luke	20	15	So they cast him out of the vineyard , and killed him . What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
BRG	Luke	20	16	He shall come and destroy these husbandmen , and shall give the vineyard to others . And when they heard it , they said , God forbid .
BRG	Luke	20	17	And he beheld them , and said , What is this then that is written , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner ?
BRG	Luke	20	18	Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken ; but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder .
BRG	Luke	20	19	And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them .
BRG	Luke	20	21	And they asked him , saying , Master , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , neither acceptest thou the person of any , but teachest the way of God truly :
BRG	Luke	20	22	Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar , or no ?
BRG	Luke	20	23	But he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them , Why tempt ye me ?
BRG	Luke	20	24	Shew me a penny . Whose image and superscription hath it ? They answered and said , Caesar ’ s .
BRG	Luke	20	25	And he said unto them , Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar ’ s , and unto God the things which be God ’ s .
BRG	Luke	20	26	And they could not take hold of his words before the people : and they marvelled at his answer , and held their peace .
BRG	Luke	20	27	Then came to him certain of the Sadducees , which deny that there is any resurrection ; and they asked him ,
BRG	Luke	20	28	Saying , Master , Moses wrote unto us , If any man ’ s brother die , having a wife , and he die without children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
BRG	Luke	20	29	There were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died without children .
BRG	Luke	20	30	And the second took her to wife , and he died childless .
BRG	Luke	20	31	And the third took her ; and in like manner the seven also : and they left no children , and died .
BRG	Luke	20	32	Last of all the woman died also .
BRG	Luke	20	33	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she ? for seven had her to wife .
BRG	Luke	20	34	And Jesus answering said unto them , The children of this world marry , and are given in marriage :
BRG	Luke	20	35	But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage :
BRG	Luke	20	36	Neither can they die any more : for they are equal unto the angels ; and are the children of God , being the children of the resurrection .
BRG	Luke	20	37	Now that the dead are raised , even Moses shewed at the bush , when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob .
BRG	Luke	20	38	For he is not a God of the dead , but of the living : for all live unto him .
BRG	Luke	20	39	Then certain of the scribes answering said , Master , thou hast well said .
BRG	Luke	20	40	And after that they durst not ask him any question at all .
BRG	Luke	20	41	And he said unto them , How say they that Christ is David ’ s son ?
BRG	Luke	20	42	And David himself saith in the book of Psalms , The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand ,
BRG	Luke	20	43	Till I make thine enemies thy footstool .
BRG	Luke	20	44	David therefore calleth him Lord , how is he then his son ?
BRG	Luke	20	45	Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples ,
BRG	Luke	20	46	Beware of the scribes , which desire to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the markets , and the highest seats in the synagogues , and the chief rooms at feasts ;
BRG	Luke	20	47	Which devour widows ’ houses , and for a shew make long prayers : the same shall receive greater damnation . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Luke	21	21	Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto .
BRG	Luke	21	2	And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites .
BRG	Luke	21	3	And he said , Of a truth I say unto you , that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all :
BRG	Luke	21	4	For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God : but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had .
BRG	Luke	21	5	And as some spake of the temple , how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts , he said ,
BRG	Luke	21	6	As for these things which ye behold , the days will come , in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
BRG	Luke	21	7	And they asked him , saying , Master , but when shall these things be ? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass ?
BRG	Luke	21	8	And he said , Take heed that ye be not deceived : for many shall come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and the time draweth near : go ye not therefore after them .
BRG	Luke	21	9	But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by .
BRG	Luke	21	10	Then said he unto them , Nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom :
BRG	Luke	21	11	And great earthquakes shall be in divers places , and famines , and pestilences ; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven .
BRG	Luke	21	12	But before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues , and into prisons , being brought before kings and rulers for my name ’ s sake .
BRG	Luke	21	13	And it shall turn to you for a testimony .
BRG	Luke	21	14	Settle it therefore in your hearts , not to meditate before what ye shall answer :
BRG	Luke	21	15	For I will give you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist .
BRG	Luke	21	16	And ye shall be betrayed both by parents , and brethren , and kinsfolks , and friends ; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death .
BRG	Luke	21	17	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name ’ s sake .
BRG	Luke	21	18	But there shall not an hair of your head perish .
BRG	Luke	21	19	In your patience possess ye your souls .
BRG	Luke	21	20	And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies , then know that the desolation thereof is nigh .

BRG	Luke	21	23	But woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck , in those days ! for there shall be great distress in the land , and wrath upon this people .
BRG	Luke	21	24	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led away captive into all nations : and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled .
BRG	Luke	21	25	And there shall be signs in the sun , and in the moon , and in the stars ; and upon the earth distress of nations , with perplexity ; the sea and the waves roaring ;
BRG	Luke	21	26	Men ’ s hearts failing them for fear , and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth : for the powers of heaven shall be shaken .

BRG	Luke	22	22	And truly the Son of man goeth , as it was determined : but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed !
BRG	Luke	22	2	And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him ; for they feared the people .
BRG	Luke	22	3	Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot , being of the number of the twelve .
BRG	Luke	22	4	And he went his way , and communed with the chief priests and captains , how he might betray him unto them .
BRG	Luke	22	5	And they were glad , and covenanted to give him money .
BRG	Luke	22	6	And he promised , and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude .
BRG	Luke	22	7	Then came the day of unleavened bread , when the passover must be killed .
BRG	Luke	22	8	And he sent Peter and John , saying , Go and prepare us the passover , that we may eat .
BRG	Luke	22	9	And they said unto him , Where wilt thou that we prepare ?
BRG	Luke	22	10	And he said unto them , Behold , when ye are entered into the city , there shall a man meet you , bearing a pitcher of water ; follow him into the house where he entereth in .
BRG	Luke	22	11	And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house , The Master saith unto thee , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
BRG	Luke	22	12	And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished : there make ready .
BRG	Luke	22	13	And they went , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
BRG	Luke	22	14	And when the hour was come , he sat down , and the twelve apostles with him .
BRG	Luke	22	15	And he said unto them , With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer :
BRG	Luke	22	16	For I say unto you , I will not any more eat thereof , until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God .
BRG	Luke	22	17	And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , Take this , and divide it among yourselves :
BRG	Luke	22	18	For I say unto you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God shall come .
BRG	Luke	22	19	And he took bread , and gave thanks , and brake it , and gave unto them , saying , This is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me .
BRG	Luke	22	20	Likewise also the cup after supper , saying , This cup is the new testament in my blood , which is shed for you .
BRG	Luke	22	21	But , behold , the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table .
BRG	Luke	22	23	And they began to enquire among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing .
BRG	Luke	22	24	And there was also a strife among them , which of them should be accounted the greatest .
BRG	Luke	22	25	And he said unto them , The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors .
BRG	Luke	22	26	But ye shall not be so : but he that is greatest among you , let him be as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that doth serve .
BRG	Luke	22	27	For whether is greater , he that sitteth at meat , or he that serveth ? is not he that sitteth at meat ? but I am among you as he that serveth .
BRG	Luke	22	28	Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations .
BRG	Luke	22	29	And I appoint unto you a kingdom , as my Father hath appointed unto me ;
BRG	Luke	22	30	That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
BRG	Luke	22	31	And the Lord said , Simon , Simon , behold , Satan hath desired to have you , that he may sift you as wheat :
BRG	Luke	22	32	But I have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not : and when thou art converted , strengthen thy brethren .
BRG	Luke	22	33	And he said unto him , Lord , I am ready to go with thee , both into prison , and to death .
BRG	Luke	22	34	And he said , I tell thee , Peter , the cock shall not crow this day , before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me .
BRG	Luke	22	35	And he said unto them , When I sent you without purse , and scrip , and shoes , lacked ye any thing ? And they said , Nothing .
BRG	Luke	22	36	Then said he unto them , But now , he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise his scrip : and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one .
BRG	Luke	22	37	For I say unto you , that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me , And he was reckoned among the transgressors : for the things concerning me have an end .
BRG	Luke	22	38	And they said , Lord , behold , here are two swords . And he said unto them , It is enough .
BRG	Luke	22	39	And he came out , and went , as he was wont , to the mount of Olives ; and his disciples also followed him .
BRG	Luke	22	40	And when he was at the place , he said unto them , Pray that ye enter not into temptation .
BRG	Luke	22	41	And he was withdrawn from them about a stone ’ s cast , and kneeled down , and prayed ,
BRG	Luke	22	42	Saying , Father , if thou be willing , remove this cup from me : nevertheless not my will , but thine , be done .
BRG	Luke	22	43	And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven , strengthening him .
BRG	Luke	22	44	And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly : and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground .
BRG	Luke	22	45	And when he rose up from prayer , and was come to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow ,
BRG	Luke	22	46	And said unto them , Why sleep ye ? rise and pray , lest ye enter into temptation .
BRG	Luke	22	47	And while he yet spake , behold a multitude , and he that was called Judas , one of the twelve , went before them , and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him .
BRG	Luke	22	48	But Jesus said unto him , Judas , betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss ?
BRG	Luke	22	49	When they which were about him saw what would follow , they said unto him , Lord , shall we smite with the sword ?
BRG	Luke	22	50	And one of them smote the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
BRG	Luke	22	51	And Jesus answered and said , Suffer ye thus far . And he touched his ear , and healed him .
BRG	Luke	22	52	Then Jesus said unto the chief priests , and captains of the temple , and the elders , which were come to him , Be ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and staves ?
BRG	Luke	22	53	When I was daily with you in the temple , ye stretched forth no hands against me : but this is your hour , and the power of darkness .
BRG	Luke	22	54	Then took they him , and led him , and brought him into the high priest ’ s house . And Peter followed afar off .
BRG	Luke	22	55	And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall , and were set down together , Peter sat down among them .
BRG	Luke	22	56	But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire , and earnestly looked upon him , and said , This man was also with him .
BRG	Luke	22	57	And he denied him , saying , Woman , I know him not .
BRG	Luke	22	58	And after a little while another saw him , and said , Thou art also of them . And Peter said , Man , I am not .
BRG	Luke	22	59	And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed , saying , Of a truth this fellow also was with him : for he is a Galilaean .
BRG	Luke	22	60	And Peter said , Man , I know not what thou sayest . And immediately , while he yet spake , the cock crew .
BRG	Luke	22	61	And the Lord turned , and looked upon Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he had said unto him , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
BRG	Luke	22	62	And Peter went out , and wept bitterly .
BRG	Luke	22	63	And the men that held Jesus mocked him , and smote him .
BRG	Luke	22	64	And when they had blindfolded him , they struck him on the face , and asked him , saying , Prophesy , who is it that smote thee ?
BRG	Luke	22	65	And many other things blasphemously spake they against him .
BRG	Luke	22	66	And as soon as it was day , the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together , and led him into their council , saying ,
BRG	Luke	22	67	Art thou the Christ ? tell us . And he said unto them , If I tell you , ye will not believe :
BRG	Luke	22	68	And if I also ask you , ye will not answer me , nor let me go .
BRG	Luke	22	69	Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God .
BRG	Luke	22	70	Then said they all , Art thou then the Son of God ? And he said unto them , Ye say that I am .

BRG	Luke	23	18	And they cried out all at once , saying , Away with this man , and release unto us Barabbas :
BRG	Luke	23	19	( Who for a certain sedition made in the city , and for murder , was cast into prison . )
BRG	Luke	23	20	Pilate therefore , willing to release Jesus , spake again to them .
BRG	Luke	23	21	But they cried , saying , Crucify him , crucify him .
BRG	Luke	23	22	And he said unto them the third time , Why , what evil hath he done ? I have found no cause of death in him : I will therefore chastise him , and let him go .
BRG	Luke	23	24	And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required .
BRG	Luke	23	25	And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison , whom they had desired ; but he delivered Jesus to their will .
BRG	Luke	23	26	And as they led him away , they laid hold upon one Simon , a Cyrenian , coming out of the country , and on him they laid the cross , that he might bear it after Jesus .
BRG	Luke	23	27	And there followed him a great company of people , and of women , which also bewailed and lamented him .
BRG	Luke	23	28	But Jesus turning unto them said , Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not for me , but weep for yourselves , and for your children .
BRG	Luke	23	29	For , behold , the days are coming , in the which they shall say , Blessed are the barren , and the wombs that never bare , and the paps which never gave suck .
BRG	Luke	23	30	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains , Fall on us ; and to the hills , Cover us .
BRG	Luke	23	31	For if they do these things in a green tree , what shall be done in the dry ?
BRG	Luke	23	32	And there were also two other , malefactors , led with him to be put to death .
BRG	Luke	23	33	And when they were come to the place , which is called Calvary , there they crucified him , and the malefactors , one on the right hand , and the other on the left .
BRG	Luke	23	34	Then said Jesus , Father , forgive them ; for they know not what they do . And they parted his raiment , and cast lots .
BRG	Luke	23	35	And the people stood beholding . And the rulers also with them derided him , saying , He saved others ; let him save himself , if he be Christ , the chosen of God .
BRG	Luke	23	36	And the soldiers also mocked him , coming to him , and offering him vinegar ,
BRG	Luke	23	37	And saying , If thou be the king of the Jews , save thyself .
BRG	Luke	23	38	And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and Hebrew , This Is the King of the Jews .
BRG	Luke	23	39	And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him , saying , If thou be Christ , save thyself and us .
BRG	Luke	23	40	But the other answering rebuked him , saying , Dost not thou fear God , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ?
BRG	Luke	23	41	And we indeed justly ; for we receive the due reward of our deeds : but this man hath done nothing amiss .
BRG	Luke	23	42	And he said unto Jesus , Lord , remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom .
BRG	Luke	23	43	And Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , To day shalt thou be with me in paradise .
BRG	Luke	23	44	And it was about the sixth hour , and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour .
BRG	Luke	23	45	And the sun was darkened , and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst .
BRG	Luke	23	46	And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice , he said , Father , into thy hands I commend my Spirit : and having said thus , he gave up the ghost .
BRG	Luke	23	47	Now when the centurion saw what was done , he glorified God , saying , Certainly this was a righteous man .
BRG	Luke	23	48	And all the people that came together to that sight , beholding the things which were done , smote their breasts , and returned .
BRG	Luke	23	49	And all his acquaintance , and the women that followed him from Galilee , stood afar off , beholding these things .
BRG	Luke	23	50	And , behold , there was a man named Joseph , a counsellor ; and he was a good man , and a just :
BRG	Luke	23	51	( The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them ; ) he was of Arimathaea , a city of the Jews : who also himself waited for the kingdom of God .
BRG	Luke	23	52	This man went unto Pilate , and begged the body of Jesus .
BRG	Luke	23	53	And he took it down , and wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone , wherein never man before was laid .
BRG	Luke	23	54	And that day was the preparation , and the sabbath drew on .
BRG	Luke	23	55	And the women also , which came with him from Galilee , followed after , and beheld the sepulchre , and how his body was laid .
BRG	Luke	23	56	And they returned , and prepared spices and ointments ; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Luke	24	24	And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not .
BRG	Luke	24	2	And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre .
BRG	Luke	24	3	And they entered in , and found not the body of the Lord Jesus .
BRG	Luke	24	4	And it came to pass , as they were much perplexed thereabout , behold , two men stood by them in shining garments :
BRG	Luke	24	5	And as they were afraid , and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , Why seek ye the living among the dead ?
BRG	Luke	24	6	He is not here , but is risen : remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee ,
BRG	Luke	24	7	Saying , The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again .
BRG	Luke	24	8	And they remembered his words ,
BRG	Luke	24	9	And returned from the sepulchre , and told all these things unto the eleven , and to all the rest .
BRG	Luke	24	10	It was Mary Magdalene , and Joanna , and Mary the mother of James , and other women that were with them , which told these things unto the apostles .
BRG	Luke	24	11	And their words seemed to them as idle tales , and they believed them not .
BRG	Luke	24	12	Then arose Peter , and ran unto the sepulchre ; and stooping down , he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves , and departed , wondering in himself at that which was come to pass .
BRG	Luke	24	13	And , behold , two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus , which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs .
BRG	Luke	24	14	And they talked together of all these things which had happened .
BRG	Luke	24	15	And it came to pass , that , while they communed together and reasoned , Jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
BRG	Luke	24	16	But their eyes were holden that they should not know him .
BRG	Luke	24	17	And he said unto them , What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another , as ye walk , and are sad ?
BRG	Luke	24	18	And the one of them , whose name was Cleopas , answering said unto him , Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem , and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days ?
BRG	Luke	24	19	And he said unto them , What things ? And they said unto him , Concerning Jesus of Nazareth , which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people :
BRG	Luke	24	20	And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death , and have crucified him .
BRG	Luke	24	21	But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel : and beside all this , to day is the third day since these things were done .
BRG	Luke	24	22	Yea , and certain women also of our company made us astonished , which were early at the sepulchre ;
BRG	Luke	24	23	And when they found not his body , they came , saying , that they had also seen a vision of angels , which said that he was alive .
BRG	Luke	24	25	Then he said unto them , O fools , and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken :
BRG	Luke	24	26	Ought not Christ to have suffered these things , and to enter into his glory ?
BRG	Luke	24	27	And beginning at Moses and all the prophets , he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself .
BRG	Luke	24	28	And they drew nigh unto the village , whither they went : and he made as though he would have gone further .
BRG	Luke	24	29	But they constrained him , saying , Abide with us : for it is toward evening , and the day is far spent . And he went in to tarry with them .
BRG	Luke	24	30	And it came to pass , as he sat at meat with them , he took bread , and blessed it , and brake , and gave to them .
BRG	Luke	24	31	And their eyes were opened , and they knew him ; and he vanished out of their sight .
BRG	Luke	24	32	And they said one to another , Did not our heart burn within us , while he talked with us by the way , and while he opened to us the scriptures ?
BRG	Luke	24	33	And they rose up the same hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
BRG	Luke	24	34	Saying , The Lord is risen indeed , and hath appeared to Simon .
BRG	Luke	24	35	And they told what things were done in the way , and how he was known of them in breaking of bread .
BRG	Luke	24	36	And as they thus spake , Jesus himself stood in the midst of them , and saith unto them , Peace be unto you .
BRG	Luke	24	37	But they were terrified and affrighted , and supposed that they had seen a spirit .
BRG	Luke	24	38	And he said unto them , Why are ye troubled ? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts ?
BRG	Luke	24	39	Behold my hands and my feet , that it is I myself : handle me , and see ; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones , as ye see me have .
BRG	Luke	24	40	And when he had thus spoken , he shewed them his hands and his feet .
BRG	Luke	24	41	And while they yet believed not for joy , and wondered , he said unto them , Have ye here any meat ?
BRG	Luke	24	42	And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish , and of an honeycomb .
BRG	Luke	24	43	And he took it , and did eat before them .
BRG	Luke	24	44	And he said unto them , These are the words which I spake unto you , while I was yet with you , that all things must be fulfilled , which were written in the law of Moses , and in the prophets , and in the psalms , concerning me .
BRG	Luke	24	45	Then opened he their understanding , that they might understand the scriptures ,
BRG	Luke	24	46	And said unto them , Thus it is written , and thus it behoved Christ to suffer , and to rise from the dead the third day :
BRG	Luke	24	47	And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations , beginning at Jerusalem .
BRG	Luke	24	48	And ye are witnesses of these things .
BRG	Luke	24	49	And , behold , I send the promise of my Father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem , until ye be endued with power from on high .
BRG	Luke	24	50	And he led them out as far as to Bethany , and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them .
BRG	Luke	24	51	And it came to pass , while he blessed them , he was parted from them , and carried up into heaven .

BRG	Luke	24	4145648	""
BRG	John	1	1	In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
BRG	John	1	2	The same was in the beginning with God .
BRG	John	1	3	All things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made that was made .
BRG	John	1	4	In him was life ; and the life was the light of men .
BRG	John	1	5	And the light shineth in darkness ; and the darkness comprehended it not .
BRG	John	1	6	There was a man sent from God , whose name was John .
BRG	John	1	7	The same came for a witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all men through him might believe .
BRG	John	1	8	He was not that Light , but was sent to bear witness of that Light .
BRG	John	1	9	That was the true Light , which lighteth every man that cometh into the world .
BRG	John	1	10	He was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not .
BRG	John	1	11	He came unto his own , and his own received him not .
BRG	John	1	12	But as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of God , even to them that believe on his name :
BRG	John	1	13	Which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
BRG	John	1	14	And the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , ( and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the Father , ) full of grace and truth .
BRG	John	1	15	John bare witness of him , and cried , saying , This was he of whom I spake , He that cometh after me is preferred before me : for he was before me .
BRG	John	1	16	And of his fulness have all we received , and grace for grace .
BRG	John	1	17	For the law was given by Moses , but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ .
BRG	John	1	18	No man hath seen God at any time ; the only begotten Son , which is in the bosom of the Father , he hath declared him .
BRG	John	1	19	And this is the record of John , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , Who art thou ?
BRG	John	1	20	And he confessed , and denied not ; but confessed , I am not the Christ .
BRG	John	1	21	And they asked him , What then ? Art thou Elias ? And he saith , I am not . Art thou that prophet ? And he answered , No .
BRG	John	1	22	Then said they unto him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . What sayest thou of thyself ?
BRG	John	1	23	He said , I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make straight the way of the Lord , as said the prophet Esaias .
BRG	John	1	24	And they which were sent were of the Pharisees .
BRG	John	1	25	And they asked him , and said unto him , Why baptizest thou then , if thou be not that Christ , nor Elias , neither that prophet ?
BRG	John	1	26	John answered them , saying , I baptize with water : but there standeth one among you , whom ye know not ;
BRG	John	1	27	He it is , who coming after me is preferred before me , whose shoe ’ s latchet I am not worthy to unloose .
BRG	John	1	28	These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan , where John was baptizing .
BRG	John	1	29	The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him , and saith , Behold the Lamb of God , which taketh away the sin of the world .
BRG	John	1	30	This is he of whom I said , After me cometh a man which is preferred before me : for he was before me .
BRG	John	1	31	And I knew him not : but that he should be made manifest to Israel , therefore am I come baptizing with water .
BRG	John	1	32	And John bare record , saying , I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove , and it abode upon him .
BRG	John	1	33	And I knew him not : but he that sent me to baptize with water , the same said unto me , Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending , and remaining on him , the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost .
BRG	John	1	34	And I saw , and bare record that this is the Son of God .
BRG	John	1	35	Again the next day after John stood , and two of his disciples ;
BRG	John	1	36	And looking upon Jesus as he walked , he saith , Behold the Lamb of God !
BRG	John	1	37	And the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed Jesus .
BRG	John	1	38	Then Jesus turned , and saw them following , and saith unto them , What seek ye ? They said unto him , Rabbi , ( which is to say , being interpreted , Master , ) where dwellest thou ?
BRG	John	1	39	He saith unto them , Come and see . They came and saw where he dwelt , and abode with him that day : for it was about the tenth hour .
BRG	John	1	40	One of the two which heard John speak , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother .
BRG	John	1	41	He first findeth his own brother Simon , and saith unto him , We have found the Messias , which is , being interpreted , the Christ .
BRG	John	1	42	And he brought him to Jesus . And when Jesus beheld him , he said , Thou art Simon the son of Jona : thou shalt be called Cephas , which is by interpretation , A stone .
BRG	John	1	43	The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee , and findeth Philip , and saith unto him , Follow me .
BRG	John	1	44	Now Philip was of Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
BRG	John	1	45	Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith unto him , We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , did write , Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph .
BRG	John	1	46	And Nathanael said unto him , Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth ? Philip saith unto him , Come and see .
BRG	John	1	47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , and saith of him , Behold an Israelite indeed , in whom is no guile !
BRG	John	1	48	Nathanael saith unto him , Whence knowest thou me ? Jesus answered and said unto him , Before that Philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig tree , I saw thee .
BRG	John	1	49	Nathanael answered and saith unto him , Rabbi , thou art the Son of God ; thou art the King of Israel .
BRG	John	1	50	Jesus answered and said unto him , Because I said unto thee , I saw thee under the fig tree , believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these .
BRG	John	1	51	And he saith unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	John	2	2	And both Jesus was called , and his disciples , to the marriage .
BRG	John	2	3	And when they wanted wine , the mother of Jesus saith unto him , They have no wine .
BRG	John	2	4	Jesus saith unto her , Woman , what have I to do with thee ? mine hour is not yet come .
BRG	John	2	5	His mother saith unto the servants , Whatsoever he saith unto you , do it .
BRG	John	2	6	And there were set there six waterpots of stone , after the manner of the purifying of the Jews , containing two or three firkins apiece .
BRG	John	2	7	Jesus saith unto them , Fill the waterpots with water . And they filled them up to the brim .
BRG	John	2	8	And he saith unto them , Draw out now , and bear unto the governor of the feast . And they bare it .
BRG	John	2	9	When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , and knew not whence it was : ( but the servants which drew the water knew ; ) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom ,
BRG	John	2	10	And saith unto him , Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine ; and when men have well drunk , then that which is worse : but thou hast kept the good wine until now .
BRG	John	2	11	This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee , and manifested forth his glory ; and his disciples believed on him .
BRG	John	2	12	After this he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples : and they continued there not many days .
BRG	John	2	13	And the Jews ’ passover was at hand , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem ,
BRG	John	2	14	And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves , and the changers of money sitting :
BRG	John	2	15	And when he had made a scourge of small cords , he drove them all out of the temple , and the sheep , and the oxen ; and poured out the changers ’ money , and overthrew the tables ;
BRG	John	2	16	And said unto them that sold doves , Take these things hence ; make not my Father ’ s house an house of merchandise .
BRG	John	2	17	And his disciples remembered that it was written , The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up .
BRG	John	2	18	Then answered the Jews and said unto him , What sign shewest thou unto us , seeing that thou doest these things ?
BRG	John	2	19	Jesus answered and said unto them , Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up .
BRG	John	2	20	Then said the Jews , Forty and six years was this temple in building , and wilt thou rear it up in three days ?
BRG	John	2	21	But he spake of the temple of his body .
BRG	John	2	22	When therefore he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them ; and they believed the scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
BRG	John	2	23	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the miracles which he did .
BRG	John	2	24	But Jesus did not commit himself unto them , because he knew all men ,
BRG	John	2	25	And needed not that any should testify of man : for he knew what was in man . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	John	3	3	Jesus answered and said unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except a man be born again , he can not see the kingdom of God .
BRG	John	3	2	The same came to Jesus by night , and said unto him , Rabbi , we know that thou art a teacher come from God : for no man can do these miracles that thou doest , except God be with him .
BRG	John	3	4	Nicodemus saith unto him , How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter the second time into his mother ’ s womb , and be born ?
BRG	John	3	5	Jesus answered , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit , he can not enter into the kingdom of God .
BRG	John	3	6	That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
BRG	John	3	7	Marvel not that I said unto thee , Ye must be born again .
BRG	John	3	8	The wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the Spirit .
BRG	John	3	9	Nicodemus answered and said unto him , How can these things be ?
BRG	John	3	10	Jesus answered and said unto him , Art thou a master of Israel , and knowest not these things ?
BRG	John	3	11	Verily , verily , I say unto thee , We speak that we do know , and testify that we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness .
BRG	John	3	12	If I have told you earthly things , and ye believe not , how shall ye believe , if I tell you of heavenly things ?
BRG	John	3	13	And no man hath ascended up to heaven , but he that came down from heaven , even the Son of man which is in heaven .
BRG	John	3	14	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of man be lifted up :
BRG	John	3	15	That whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have eternal life .
BRG	John	3	16	For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life .
BRG	John	3	17	For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world ; but that the world through him might be saved .
BRG	John	3	18	He that believeth on him is not condemned : but he that believeth not is condemned already , because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God .
BRG	John	3	19	And this is the condemnation , that light is come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds were evil .
BRG	John	3	20	For every one that doeth evil hateth the light , neither cometh to the light , lest his deeds should be reproved .
BRG	John	3	21	But he that doeth truth cometh to the light , that his deeds may be made manifest , that they are wrought in God .
BRG	John	3	22	After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea ; and there he tarried with them , and baptized .
BRG	John	3	23	And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim , because there was much water there : and they came , and were baptized .
BRG	John	3	24	For John was not yet cast into prison .
BRG	John	3	25	Then there arose a question between some of John ’ s disciples and the Jews about purifying .
BRG	John	3	26	And they came unto John , and said unto him , Rabbi , he that was with thee beyond Jordan , to whom thou barest witness , behold , the same baptizeth , and all men come to him .
BRG	John	3	27	John answered and said , A man can receive nothing , except it be given him from heaven .
BRG	John	3	28	Ye yourselves bear me witness , that I said , I am not the Christ , but that I am sent before him .
BRG	John	3	29	He that hath the bride is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , which standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom ’ s voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
BRG	John	3	30	He must increase , but I must decrease .
BRG	John	3	31	He that cometh from above is above all : he that is of the earth is earthly , and speaketh of the earth : he that cometh from heaven is above all .
BRG	John	3	32	And what he hath seen and heard , that he testifieth ; and no man receiveth his testimony .
BRG	John	3	33	He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true .
BRG	John	3	34	For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God : for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him .

BRG	John	4	13	Jesus answered and said unto her , Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again :
BRG	John	4	14	But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst ; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life .
BRG	John	4	15	The woman saith unto him , Sir , give me this water , that I thirst not , neither come hither to draw .
BRG	John	4	16	Jesus saith unto her , Go , call thy husband , and come hither .
BRG	John	4	17	The woman answered and said , I have no husband . Jesus said unto her , Thou hast well said , I have no husband :
BRG	John	4	18	For thou hast had five husbands ; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband : in that saidst thou truly .
BRG	John	4	19	The woman saith unto him , Sir , I perceive that thou art a prophet .
BRG	John	4	20	Our fathers worshipped in this mountain ; and ye say , that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship .
BRG	John	4	21	Jesus saith unto her , Woman , believe me , the hour cometh , when ye shall neither in this mountain , nor yet at Jerusalem , worship the Father .
BRG	John	4	22	Ye worship ye know not what : we know what we worship : for salvation is of the Jews .
BRG	John	4	23	But the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in Spirit and in truth : for the Father seeketh such to worship him .
BRG	John	4	24	God is a Spirit : and they that worship him must worship him in Spirit and in truth .
BRG	John	4	25	The woman saith unto him , I know that Messias cometh , which is called Christ : when he is come , he will tell us all things .
BRG	John	4	26	Jesus saith unto her , I that speak unto thee am he .
BRG	John	4	27	And upon this came his disciples , and marvelled that he talked with the woman : yet no man said , What seekest thou ? or , Why talkest thou with her ?
BRG	John	4	28	The woman then left her waterpot , and went her way into the city , and saith to the men ,
BRG	John	4	29	Come , see a man , which told me all things that ever I did : is not this the Christ ?
BRG	John	4	30	Then they went out of the city , and came unto him .
BRG	John	4	31	In the mean while his disciples prayed him , saying , Master , eat .
BRG	John	4	32	But he said unto them , I have meat to eat that ye know not of .
BRG	John	4	33	Therefore said the disciples one to another , Hath any man brought him ought to eat ?
BRG	John	4	34	Jesus saith unto them , My meat is to do the will of him that sent me , and to finish his work .
BRG	John	4	35	Say not ye , There are yet four months , and then cometh harvest ? behold , I say unto you , Lift up your eyes , and look on the fields ; for they are white already to harvest .
BRG	John	4	36	And he that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life eternal : that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together .
BRG	John	4	37	And herein is that saying true , One soweth , and another reapeth .
BRG	John	4	38	I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour : other men laboured , and ye are entered into their labours .
BRG	John	4	39	And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman , which testified , He told me all that ever I did .
BRG	John	4	40	So when the Samaritans were come unto him , they besought him that he would tarry with them : and he abode there two days .
BRG	John	4	41	And many more believed because of his own word ;
BRG	John	4	42	And said unto the woman , Now we believe , not because of thy saying : for we have heard him ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Saviour of the world .
BRG	John	4	43	Now after two days he departed thence , and went into Galilee .
BRG	John	4	44	For Jesus himself testified , that a prophet hath no honour in his own country .
BRG	John	4	45	Then when he was come into Galilee , the Galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast .
BRG	John	4	46	So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . And there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at Capernaum .
BRG	John	4	47	When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee , he went unto him , and besought him that he would come down , and heal his son : for he was at the point of death .
BRG	John	4	48	Then said Jesus unto him , Except ye see signs and wonders , ye will not believe .
BRG	John	4	49	The nobleman saith unto him , Sir , come down ere my child die .
BRG	John	4	50	Jesus saith unto him , Go thy way ; thy son liveth . And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way .
BRG	John	4	51	And as he was now going down , his servants met him , and told him , saying , Thy son liveth .
BRG	John	4	52	Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend . And they said unto him , Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him .
BRG	John	4	53	So the father knew that it was at the same hour , in the which Jesus said unto him , Thy son liveth : and himself believed , and his whole house .

BRG	John	4	4145648	""
BRG	John	5	5	And a certain man was there , which had an infirmity thirty and eight years .
BRG	John	5	2	Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool , which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda , having five porches .
BRG	John	5	3	In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk , of blind , halt , withered , waiting for the moving of the water .
BRG	John	5	4	For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool , and troubled the water : whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had .
BRG	John	5	6	When Jesus saw him lie , and knew that he had been now a long time in that case , he saith unto him , Wilt thou be made whole ?
BRG	John	5	7	The impotent man answered him , Sir , I have no man , when the water is troubled , to put me into the pool : but while I am coming , another steppeth down before me .
BRG	John	5	8	Jesus saith unto him , Rise , take up thy bed , and walk .
BRG	John	5	9	And immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sabbath .
BRG	John	5	10	The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured , It is the sabbath day : it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed .
BRG	John	5	11	He answered them , He that made me whole , the same said unto me , Take up thy bed , and walk .
BRG	John	5	12	Then asked they him , What man is that which said unto thee , Take up thy bed , and walk ?
BRG	John	5	13	And he that was healed wist not who it was : for Jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in that place .
BRG	John	5	14	Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple , and said unto him , Behold , thou art made whole : sin no more , lest a worse thing come unto thee .
BRG	John	5	15	The man departed , and told the Jews that it was Jesus , which had made him whole .
BRG	John	5	16	And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus , and sought to slay him , because he had done these things on the sabbath day .
BRG	John	5	17	But Jesus answered them , My Father worketh hitherto , and I work .
BRG	John	5	18	Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him , because he not only had broken the sabbath , but said also that God was his Father , making himself equal with God .
BRG	John	5	19	Then answered Jesus and said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he seeth the Father do : for what things soever he doeth , these also doeth the Son likewise .
BRG	John	5	20	For the Father loveth the Son , and sheweth him all things that himself doeth : and he will shew him greater works than these , that ye may marvel .
BRG	John	5	21	For as the Father raiseth up the dead , and quickeneth them ; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will .
BRG	John	5	22	For the Father judgeth no man , but hath committed all judgment unto the Son :
BRG	John	5	23	That all men should honour the Son , even as they honour the Father . He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him .
BRG	John	5	24	Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that heareth my word , and believeth on him that sent me , hath everlasting life , and shall not come into condemnation ; but is passed from death unto life .
BRG	John	5	25	Verily , verily , I say unto you , The hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear shall live .
BRG	John	5	26	For as the Father hath life in himself ; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself ;
BRG	John	5	27	And hath given him authority to execute judgment also , because he is the Son of man .
BRG	John	5	28	Marvel not at this : for the hour is coming , in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice ,
BRG	John	5	29	And shall come forth ; they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of damnation .
BRG	John	5	30	I can of mine own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of the Father which hath sent me .
BRG	John	5	31	If I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true .
BRG	John	5	32	There is another that beareth witness of me ; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true .
BRG	John	5	33	Ye sent unto John , and he bare witness unto the truth .
BRG	John	5	34	But I receive not testimony from man : but these things I say , that ye might be saved .
BRG	John	5	35	He was a burning and a shining light : and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light .
BRG	John	5	36	But I have greater witness than that of John : for the works which the Father hath given me to finish , the same works that I do , bear witness of me , that the Father hath sent me .
BRG	John	5	37	And the Father himself , which hath sent me , hath borne witness of me . Ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape .
BRG	John	5	38	And ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he hath sent , him ye believe not .
BRG	John	5	39	Search the scriptures ; for in them ye think ye have eternal life : and they are they which testify of me .
BRG	John	5	40	And ye will not come to me , that ye might have life .
BRG	John	5	41	I receive not honour from men .
BRG	John	5	42	But I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you .
BRG	John	5	43	I am come in my Father ’ s name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .
BRG	John	5	44	How can ye believe , which receive honour one of another , and seek not the honour that cometh from God only ?
BRG	John	5	45	Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father : there is one that accuseth you , even Moses , in whom ye trust .
BRG	John	5	46	For had ye believed Moses , ye would have believed me : for he wrote of me .
BRG	John	5	47	But if ye believe not his writings , how shall ye believe my words ? Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	John	6	6	And this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do .
BRG	John	6	2	And a great multitude followed him , because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased .
BRG	John	6	3	And Jesus went up into a mountain , and there he sat with his disciples .
BRG	John	6	4	And the passover , a feast of the Jews , was nigh .
BRG	John	6	5	When Jesus then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come unto him , he saith unto Philip , Whence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ?
BRG	John	6	7	Philip answered him , Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one of them may take a little .
BRG	John	6	8	One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter ’ s brother , saith unto him ,
BRG	John	6	9	There is a lad here , which hath five barley loaves , and two small fishes : but what are they among so many ?
BRG	John	6	10	And Jesus said , Make the men sit down . Now there was much grass in the place . So the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
BRG	John	6	11	And Jesus took the loaves ; and when he had given thanks , he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to them that were set down ; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would .
BRG	John	6	12	When they were filled , he said unto his disciples , Gather up the fragments that remain , that nothing be lost .
BRG	John	6	13	Therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which remained over and above unto them that had eaten .
BRG	John	6	14	Then those men , when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did , said , This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world .
BRG	John	6	15	When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
BRG	John	6	16	And when even was now come , his disciples went down unto the sea ,
BRG	John	6	17	And entered into a ship , and went over the sea toward Capernaum . And it was now dark , and Jesus was not come to them .
BRG	John	6	18	And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew .
BRG	John	6	19	So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the ship : and they were afraid .
BRG	John	6	20	But he saith unto them , It is I ; be not afraid .
BRG	John	6	21	Then they willingly received him into the ship : and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went .
BRG	John	6	22	The day following , when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there , save that one whereinto his disciples were entered , and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat , but that his disciples were gone away alone ;
BRG	John	6	23	( Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread , after that the Lord had given thanks : )
BRG	John	6	24	When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they also took shipping , and came to Capernaum , seeking for Jesus .
BRG	John	6	25	And when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , Rabbi , when camest thou hither ?
BRG	John	6	26	Jesus answered them and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Ye seek me , not because ye saw the miracles , but because ye did eat of the loaves , and were filled .
BRG	John	6	27	Labour not for the meat which perisheth , but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life , which the Son of man shall give unto you : for him hath God the Father sealed .
BRG	John	6	28	Then said they unto him , What shall we do , that we might work the works of God ?
BRG	John	6	29	Jesus answered and said unto them , This is the work of God , that ye believe on him whom he hath sent .
BRG	John	6	30	They said therefore unto him , What sign shewest thou then , that we may see , and believe thee ? what dost thou work ?
BRG	John	6	31	Our fathers did eat manna in the desert ; as it is written , He gave them bread from heaven to eat .
BRG	John	6	32	Then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Moses gave you not that bread from heaven ; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven .
BRG	John	6	33	For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven , and giveth life unto the world .
BRG	John	6	34	Then said they unto him , Lord , evermore give us this bread .
BRG	John	6	35	And Jesus said unto them , I am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall never hunger ; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst .
BRG	John	6	36	But I said unto you , That ye also have seen me , and believe not .
BRG	John	6	37	All that the Father giveth me shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out .
BRG	John	6	38	For I came down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me .
BRG	John	6	39	And this is the Father ’ s will which hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
BRG	John	6	40	And this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which seeth the Son , and believeth on him , may have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day .
BRG	John	6	41	The Jews then murmured at him , because he said , I am the bread which came down from heaven .
BRG	John	6	42	And they said , Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how is it then that he saith , I came down from heaven ?
BRG	John	6	43	Jesus therefore answered and said unto them , Murmur not among yourselves .
BRG	John	6	44	No man can come to me , except the Father which hath sent me draw him : and I will raise him up at the last day .
BRG	John	6	45	It is written in the prophets , And they shall be all taught of God . Every man therefore that hath heard , and hath learned of the Father , cometh unto me .
BRG	John	6	46	Not that any man hath seen the Father , save he which is of God , he hath seen the Father .
BRG	John	6	47	Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me hath everlasting life .
BRG	John	6	48	I am that bread of life .
BRG	John	6	49	Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness , and are dead .
BRG	John	6	50	This is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
BRG	John	6	51	I am the living bread which came down from heaven : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : and the bread that I will give is my flesh , which I will give for the life of the world .
BRG	John	6	52	The Jews therefore strove among themselves , saying , How can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
BRG	John	6	53	Then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
BRG	John	6	54	Whoso eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day .
BRG	John	6	55	For my flesh is meat indeed , and my blood is drink indeed .
BRG	John	6	56	He that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , dwelleth in me , and I in him .
BRG	John	6	57	As the living Father hath sent me , and I live by the Father : so he that eateth me , even he shall live by me .
BRG	John	6	58	This is that bread which came down from heaven : not as your fathers did eat manna , and are dead : he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever .
BRG	John	6	59	These things said he in the synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum .
BRG	John	6	60	Many therefore of his disciples , when they had heard this , said , This is an hard saying ; who can hear it ?
BRG	John	6	61	When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it , he said unto them , Doth this offend you ?
BRG	John	6	62	What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before ?
BRG	John	6	63	It is the Spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that I speak unto you , they are Spirit , and they are life .
BRG	John	6	64	But there are some of you that believe not . For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not , and who should betray him .
BRG	John	6	65	And he said , Therefore said I unto you , that no man can come unto me , except it were given unto him of my Father .
BRG	John	6	66	From that time many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him .
BRG	John	6	67	Then said Jesus unto the twelve , Will ye also go away ?
BRG	John	6	68	Then Simon Peter answered him , Lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life .
BRG	John	6	69	And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ , the Son of the living God .
BRG	John	6	70	Jesus answered them , Have not I chosen you twelve , and one of you is a devil ?
BRG	John	6	71	He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon : for he it was that should betray him , being one of the twelve . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	John	7	7	The world can not hate you ; but me it hateth , because I testify of it , that the works thereof are evil .
BRG	John	7	2	Now the Jews ’ feast of tabernacles was at hand .
BRG	John	7	3	His brethren therefore said unto him , Depart hence , and go into Judaea , that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest .
BRG	John	7	4	For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret , and he himself seeketh to be known openly . If thou do these things , shew thyself to the world .
BRG	John	7	5	For neither did his brethren believe in him .
BRG	John	7	6	Then Jesus said unto them , My time is not yet come : but your time is alway ready .
BRG	John	7	8	Go ye up unto this feast : I go not up yet unto this feast ; for my time is not yet full come .
BRG	John	7	9	When he had said these words unto them , he abode still in Galilee .
BRG	John	7	10	But when his brethren were gone up , then went he also up unto the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
BRG	John	7	11	Then the Jews sought him at the feast , and said , Where is he ?
BRG	John	7	12	And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him : for some said , He is a good man : others said , Nay ; but he deceiveth the people .
BRG	John	7	13	Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews .
BRG	John	7	14	Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple , and taught .
BRG	John	7	15	And the Jews marvelled , saying , How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ?
BRG	John	7	16	Jesus answered them , and said , My doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me .
BRG	John	7	17	If any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself .
BRG	John	7	18	He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
BRG	John	7	19	Did not Moses give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law ? Why go ye about to kill me ?
BRG	John	7	20	The people answered and said , Thou hast a devil : who goeth about to kill thee ?
BRG	John	7	21	Jesus answered and said unto them , I have done one work , and ye all marvel .
BRG	John	7	22	Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision ; ( not because it is of Moses , but of the fathers ; ) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man .
BRG	John	7	23	If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ?
BRG	John	7	24	Judge not according to the appearance , but judge righteous judgment .
BRG	John	7	25	Then said some of them of Jerusalem , Is not this he , whom they seek to kill ?
BRG	John	7	26	But , lo , he speaketh boldly , and they say nothing unto him . Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ ?
BRG	John	7	27	Howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when Christ cometh , no man knoweth whence he is .
BRG	John	7	28	Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , Ye both know me , and ye know whence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not .
BRG	John	7	29	But I know him : for I am from him , and he hath sent me .
BRG	John	7	30	Then they sought to take him : but no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come .
BRG	John	7	31	And many of the people believed on him , and said , When Christ cometh , will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done ?
BRG	John	7	32	The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him ; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him .
BRG	John	7	33	Then said Jesus unto them , Yet a little while am I with you , and then I go unto him that sent me .
BRG	John	7	34	Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither ye can not come .
BRG	John	7	35	Then said the Jews among themselves , Whither will he go , that we shall not find him ? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles , and teach the Gentiles ?
BRG	John	7	36	What manner of saying is this that he said , Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither ye can not come ?
BRG	John	7	37	In the last day , that great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried , saying , If any man thirst , let him come unto me , and drink .
BRG	John	7	38	He that believeth on me , as the scripture hath said , out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water .
BRG	John	7	39	( But this spake he of the Spirit , which they that believe on him should receive : for the Holy Ghost was not yet given ; because that Jesus was not yet glorified . )
BRG	John	7	40	Many of the people therefore , when they heard this saying , said , Of a truth this is the Prophet .
BRG	John	7	41	Others said , This is the Christ . But some said , Shall Christ come out of Galilee ?
BRG	John	7	42	Hath not the scripture said , That Christ cometh of the seed of David , and out of the town of Bethlehem , where David was ?
BRG	John	7	43	So there was a division among the people because of him .
BRG	John	7	44	And some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him .
BRG	John	7	45	Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees ; and they said unto them , Why have ye not brought him ?
BRG	John	7	46	The officers answered , Never man spake like this man .
BRG	John	7	47	Then answered them the Pharisees , Are ye also deceived ?
BRG	John	7	48	Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him ?
BRG	John	7	49	But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed .
BRG	John	7	50	Nicodemus saith unto them , ( he that came to Jesus by night , being one of them , )
BRG	John	7	51	Doth our law judge any man , before it hear him , and know what he doeth ?
BRG	John	7	52	They answered and said unto him , Art thou also of Galilee ? Search , and look : for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet .

BRG	John	8	4	They say unto him , Master , this woman was taken in adultery , in the very act .
BRG	John	8	5	Now Moses in the law commanded us , that such should be stoned : but what sayest thou ?
BRG	John	8	6	This they said , tempting him , that they might have to accuse him . But Jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground , as though he heard them not .
BRG	John	8	7	So when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said unto them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her .
BRG	John	8	9	And they which heard it , being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one , beginning at the eldest , even unto the last : and Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
BRG	John	8	10	When Jesus had lifted up himself , and saw none but the woman , he said unto her , Woman , where are those thine accusers ? hath no man condemned thee ?
BRG	John	8	11	She said , No man , Lord . And Jesus said unto her , Neither do I condemn thee : go , and sin no more .
BRG	John	8	12	Then spake Jesus again unto them , saying , I am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life .
BRG	John	8	13	The Pharisees therefore said unto him , Thou bearest record of thyself ; thy record is not true .
BRG	John	8	14	Jesus answered and said unto them , Though I bear record of myself , yet my record is true : for I know whence I came , and whither I go ; but ye can not tell whence I come , and whither I go .
BRG	John	8	15	Ye judge after the flesh ; I judge no man .
BRG	John	8	16	And yet if I judge , my judgment is true : for I am not alone , but I and the Father that sent me .
BRG	John	8	17	It is also written in your law , that the testimony of two men is true .
BRG	John	8	18	I am one that bear witness of myself , and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me .
BRG	John	8	19	Then said they unto him , Where is thy Father ? Jesus answered , Ye neither know me , nor my Father : if ye had known me , ye should have known my Father also .
BRG	John	8	20	These words spake Jesus in the treasury , as he taught in the temple : and no man laid hands on him ; for his hour was not yet come .
BRG	John	8	21	Then said Jesus again unto them , I go my way , and ye shall seek me , and shall die in your sins : whither I go , ye can not come .
BRG	John	8	22	Then said the Jews , Will he kill himself ? because he saith , Whither I go , ye can not come .
BRG	John	8	23	And he said unto them , Ye are from beneath ; I am from above : ye are of this world ; I am not of this world .
BRG	John	8	24	I said therefore unto you , that ye shall die in your sins : for if ye believe not that I am he , ye shall die in your sins .
BRG	John	8	25	Then said they unto him , Who art thou ? And Jesus saith unto them , Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning .
BRG	John	8	26	I have many things to say and to judge of you : but he that sent me is true ; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him .
BRG	John	8	27	They understood not that he spake to them of the Father .
BRG	John	8	28	Then said Jesus unto them , When ye have lifted up the Son of man , then shall ye know that I am he , and that I do nothing of myself ; but as my Father hath taught me , I speak these things .
BRG	John	8	29	And he that sent me is with me : the Father hath not left me alone ; for I do always those things that please him .
BRG	John	8	30	As he spake these words , many believed on him .
BRG	John	8	31	Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him , If ye continue in my word , then are ye my disciples indeed ;
BRG	John	8	32	And ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free .
BRG	John	8	33	They answered him , We be Abraham ’ s seed , and were never in bondage to any man : how sayest thou , Ye shall be made free ?
BRG	John	8	34	Jesus answered them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin .
BRG	John	8	35	And the servant abideth not in the house for ever : but the Son abideth ever .
BRG	John	8	36	If the Son therefore shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed .
BRG	John	8	37	I know that ye are Abraham ’ s seed ; but ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you .
BRG	John	8	38	I speak that which I have seen with my Father : and ye do that which ye have seen with your father .
BRG	John	8	39	They answered and said unto him , Abraham is our father . Jesus saith unto them , If ye were Abraham ’ s children , ye would do the works of Abraham .
BRG	John	8	40	But now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which I have heard of God : this did not Abraham .
BRG	John	8	41	Ye do the deeds of your father . Then said they to him , We be not born of fornication ; we have one Father , even God .
BRG	John	8	42	Jesus said unto them , If God were your Father , ye would love me : for I proceeded forth and came from God ; neither came I of myself , but he sent me .
BRG	John	8	43	Why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye can not hear my word .
BRG	John	8	44	Ye are of your father the devil , and the lusts of your father ye will do . He was a murderer from the beginning , and abode not in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar , and the father of it .
BRG	John	8	45	And because I tell you the truth , ye believe me not .
BRG	John	8	46	Which of you convinceth me of sin ? And if I say the truth , why do ye not believe me ?
BRG	John	8	47	He that is of God heareth God ’ s words : ye therefore hear them not , because ye are not of God .
BRG	John	8	48	Then answered the Jews , and said unto him , Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan , and hast a devil ?
BRG	John	8	49	Jesus answered , I have not a devil ; but I honour my Father , and ye do dishonour me .
BRG	John	8	50	And I seek not mine own glory : there is one that seeketh and judgeth .
BRG	John	8	51	Verily , verily , I say unto you , If a man keep my saying , he shall never see death .
BRG	John	8	52	Then said the Jews unto him , Now we know that thou hast a devil . Abraham is dead , and the prophets ; and thou sayest , If a man keep my saying , he shall never taste of death .
BRG	John	8	53	Art thou greater than our father Abraham , which is dead ? and the prophets are dead : whom makest thou thyself ?
BRG	John	8	54	Jesus answered , If I honour myself , my honour is nothing : it is my Father that honoureth me ; of whom ye say , that he is your God :
BRG	John	8	55	Yet ye have not known him ; but I know him : and if I should say , I know him not , I shall be a liar like unto you : but I know him , and keep his saying .
BRG	John	8	56	Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day : and he saw it , and was glad .
BRG	John	8	57	Then said the Jews unto him , Thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen Abraham ?
BRG	John	8	58	Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Before Abraham was , I am .
BRG	John	8	59	Then took they up stones to cast at him : but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	John	9	9	Some said , This is he : others said , He is like him : but he said , I am he .
BRG	John	9	2	And his disciples asked him , saying , Master , who did sin , this man , or his parents , that he was born blind ?
BRG	John	9	3	Jesus answered , Neither hath this man sinned , nor his parents : but that the works of God should be made manifest in him .
BRG	John	9	4	I must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work .
BRG	John	9	5	As long as I am in the world , I am the light of the world .
BRG	John	9	6	When he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay ,
BRG	John	9	7	And said unto him , Go , wash in the pool of Siloam , ( which is by interpretation , Sent . ) He went his way therefore , and washed , and came seeing .
BRG	John	9	8	The neighbours therefore , and they which before had seen him that he was blind , said , Is not this he that sat and begged ?
BRG	John	9	10	Therefore said they unto him , How were thine eyes opened ?
BRG	John	9	11	He answered and said , A man that is called Jesus made clay , and anointed mine eyes , and said unto me , Go to the pool of Siloam , and wash : and I went and washed , and I received sight .
BRG	John	9	12	Then said they unto him , Where is he ? He said , I know not .
BRG	John	9	13	They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind .
BRG	John	9	14	And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes .
BRG	John	9	15	Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight . He said unto them , He put clay upon mine eyes , and I washed , and do see .
BRG	John	9	16	Therefore said some of the Pharisees , This man is not of God , because he keepeth not the sabbath day . Others said , How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles ? And there was a division among them .
BRG	John	9	17	They say unto the blind man again , What sayest thou of him , that he hath opened thine eyes ? He said , He is a prophet .
BRG	John	9	18	But the Jews did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight .
BRG	John	9	19	And they asked them , saying , Is this your son , who ye say was born blind ? how then doth he now see ?
BRG	John	9	20	His parents answered them and said , We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind :
BRG	John	9	21	But by what means he now seeth , we know not ; or who hath opened his eyes , we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself .
BRG	John	9	22	These words spake his parents , because they feared the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man did confess that he was Christ , he should be put out of the synagogue .
BRG	John	9	23	Therefore said his parents , He is of age ; ask him .
BRG	John	9	24	Then again called they the man that was blind , and said unto him , Give God the praise : we know that this man is a sinner .
BRG	John	9	25	He answered and said , Whether he be a sinner or no , I know not : one thing I know , that , whereas I was blind , now I see .
BRG	John	9	26	Then said they to him again , What did he to thee ? how opened he thine eyes ?
BRG	John	9	27	He answered them , I have told you already , and ye did not hear : wherefore would ye hear it again ? will ye also be his disciples ?
BRG	John	9	28	Then they reviled him , and said , Thou art his disciple ; but we are Moses ’ disciples .
BRG	John	9	29	We know that God spake unto Moses : as for this fellow , we know not from whence he is .
BRG	John	9	30	The man answered and said unto them , Why herein is a marvellous thing , that ye know not from whence he is , and yet he hath opened mine eyes .
BRG	John	9	31	Now we know that God heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of God , and doeth his will , him he heareth .
BRG	John	9	32	Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind .
BRG	John	9	33	If this man were not of God , he could do nothing .
BRG	John	9	34	They answered and said unto him , Thou wast altogether born in sins , and dost thou teach us ? And they cast him out .
BRG	John	9	35	Jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and when he had found him , he said unto him , Dost thou believe on the Son of God ?
BRG	John	9	36	He answered and said , Who is he , Lord , that I might believe on him ?
BRG	John	9	37	And Jesus said unto him , Thou hast both seen him , and it is he that talketh with thee .
BRG	John	9	38	And he said , Lord , I believe . And he worshipped him .
BRG	John	9	39	And Jesus said , For judgment I am come into this world , that they which see not might see ; and that they which see might be made blind .
BRG	John	9	40	And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words , and said unto him , Are we blind also ?
BRG	John	9	41	Jesus said unto them , If ye were blind , ye should have no sin : but now ye say , We see ; therefore your sin remaineth . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	John	10	10	The thief cometh not , but for to steal , and to kill , and to destroy : I am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more abundantly .
BRG	John	10	2	But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
BRG	John	10	3	To him the porter openeth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out .
BRG	John	10	4	And when he putteth forth his own sheep , he goeth before them , and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice .
BRG	John	10	5	And a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers .
BRG	John	10	6	This parable spake Jesus unto them : but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them .
BRG	John	10	7	Then said Jesus unto them again , Verily , verily , I say unto you , I am the door of the sheep .
BRG	John	10	8	All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them .
BRG	John	10	9	I am the door : by me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall go in and out , and find pasture .
BRG	John	10	11	I am the good shepherd : the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep .
BRG	John	10	12	But he that is an hireling , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth : and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep .
BRG	John	10	13	The hireling fleeth , because he is an hireling , and careth not for the sheep .
BRG	John	10	14	I am the good shepherd , and know my sheep , and am known of mine .
BRG	John	10	15	As the Father knoweth me , even so know I the Father : and I lay down my life for the sheep .
BRG	John	10	16	And other sheep I have , which are not of this fold : them also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one fold , and one shepherd .
BRG	John	10	17	Therefore doth my Father love me , because I lay down my life , that I might take it again .
BRG	John	10	18	No man taketh it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . This commandment have I received of my Father .
BRG	John	10	19	There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings .
BRG	John	10	20	And many of them said , He hath a devil , and is mad ; why hear ye him ?
BRG	John	10	21	Others said , These are not the words of him that hath a devil . Can a devil open the eyes of the blind ?
BRG	John	10	22	And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication , and it was winter .
BRG	John	10	23	And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon ’ s porch .
BRG	John	10	24	Then came the Jews round about him , and said unto him , How long dost thou make us to doubt ? If thou be the Christ , tell us plainly .
BRG	John	10	25	Jesus answered them , I told you , and ye believed not : the works that I do in my Father ’ s name , they bear witness of me .
BRG	John	10	26	But ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep , as I said unto you .
BRG	John	10	27	My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me :
BRG	John	10	28	And I give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand .
BRG	John	10	29	My Father , which gave them me , is greater than all ; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father ’ s hand .
BRG	John	10	30	I and my Father are one .
BRG	John	10	31	Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him .
BRG	John	10	32	Jesus answered them , Many good works have I shewed you from my Father ; for which of those works do ye stone me ?
BRG	John	10	33	The Jews answered him , saying , For a good work we stone thee not ; but for blasphemy ; and because that thou , being a man , makest thyself God .
BRG	John	10	34	Jesus answered them , Is it not written in your law , I said , Ye are gods ?
BRG	John	10	35	If he called them gods , unto whom the word of God came , and the scripture can not be broken ;
BRG	John	10	36	Say ye of him , whom the Father hath sanctified , and sent into the world , Thou blasphemest ; because I said , I am the Son of God ?
BRG	John	10	37	If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not .
BRG	John	10	38	But if I do , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know , and believe , that the Father is in me , and I in him .
BRG	John	10	39	Therefore they sought again to take him : but he escaped out of their hand ,
BRG	John	10	40	And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized ; and there he abode .

BRG	John	11	11	These things said he : and after that he saith unto them , Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ; but I go , that I may awake him out of sleep .
BRG	John	11	2	( It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick . )
BRG	John	11	3	Therefore his sisters sent unto him , saying , Lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick .
BRG	John	11	4	When Jesus heard that , he said , This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God might be glorified thereby .
BRG	John	11	5	Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus .
BRG	John	11	6	When he had heard therefore that he was sick , he abode two days still in the same place where he was .
BRG	John	11	7	Then after that saith he to his disciples , Let us go into Judaea again .
BRG	John	11	8	His disciples say unto him , Master , the Jews of late sought to stone thee ; and goest thou thither again ?
BRG	John	11	9	Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If any man walk in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world .
BRG	John	11	10	But if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because there is no light in him .
BRG	John	11	12	Then said his disciples , Lord , if he sleep , he shall do well .
BRG	John	11	13	Howbeit Jesus spake of his death : but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep .
BRG	John	11	14	Then said Jesus unto them plainly , Lazarus is dead .
BRG	John	11	15	And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him .
BRG	John	11	16	Then said Thomas , which is called Didymus , unto his fellowdisciples , Let us also go , that we may die with him .
BRG	John	11	17	Then when Jesus came , he found that he had lain in the grave four days already .
BRG	John	11	18	Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off :
BRG	John	11	19	And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary , to comfort them concerning their brother .
BRG	John	11	20	Then Martha , as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met him : but Mary sat still in the house .
BRG	John	11	21	Then said Martha unto Jesus , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
BRG	John	11	22	But I know , that even now , whatsoever thou wilt ask of God , God will give it thee .
BRG	John	11	23	Jesus saith unto her , Thy brother shall rise again .
BRG	John	11	24	Martha saith unto him , I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day .
BRG	John	11	25	Jesus said unto her , I am the resurrection , and the life : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live :
BRG	John	11	26	And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die . Believest thou this ?
BRG	John	11	27	She saith unto him , Yea , Lord : I believe that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , which should come into the world .
BRG	John	11	28	And when she had so said , she went her way , and called Mary her sister secretly , saying , The Master is come , and calleth for thee .
BRG	John	11	29	As soon as she heard that , she arose quickly , and came unto him .
BRG	John	11	30	Now Jesus was not yet come into the town , but was in that place where Martha met him .
BRG	John	11	31	The Jews then which were with her in the house , and comforted her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up hastily and went out , followed her , saying , She goeth unto the grave to weep there .
BRG	John	11	32	Then when Mary was come where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying unto him , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
BRG	John	11	33	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews also weeping which came with her , he groaned in the Spirit , and was troubled ,
BRG	John	11	34	And said , Where have ye laid him ? They said unto him , Lord , come and see .
BRG	John	11	35	Jesus wept .
BRG	John	11	36	Then said the Jews , Behold how he loved him !
BRG	John	11	37	And some of them said , Could not this man , which opened the eyes of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ?
BRG	John	11	38	Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave . It was a cave , and a stone lay upon it .
BRG	John	11	39	Jesus said , Take ye away the stone . Martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith unto him , Lord , by this time he stinketh : for he hath been dead four days .
BRG	John	11	40	Jesus saith unto her , Said I not unto thee , that , if thou wouldest believe , thou shouldest see the glory of God ?
BRG	John	11	41	Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . And Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , Father , I thank thee that thou hast heard me .
BRG	John	11	42	And I knew that thou hearest me always : but because of the people which stand by I said it , that they may believe that thou hast sent me .
BRG	John	11	43	And when he thus had spoken , he cried with a loud voice , Lazarus , come forth .
BRG	John	11	44	And he that was dead came forth , bound hand and foot with graveclothes : and his face was bound about with a napkin . Jesus saith unto them , Loose him , and let him go .
BRG	John	11	45	Then many of the Jews which came to Mary , and had seen the things which Jesus did , believed on him .
BRG	John	11	46	But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees , and told them what things Jesus had done .
BRG	John	11	47	Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council , and said , What do we ? for this man doeth many miracles .
BRG	John	11	48	If we let him thus alone , all men will believe on him : and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation .
BRG	John	11	49	And one of them , named Caiaphas , being the high priest that same year , said unto them , Ye know nothing at all ,
BRG	John	11	50	Nor consider that it is expedient for us , that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not .
BRG	John	11	51	And this spake he not of himself : but being high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation ;
BRG	John	11	52	And not for that nation only , but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad .
BRG	John	11	53	Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death .
BRG	John	11	54	Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews ; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness , into a city called Ephraim , and there continued with his disciples .
BRG	John	11	55	And the Jews ’ passover was nigh at hand : and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover , to purify themselves .
BRG	John	11	56	Then sought they for Jesus , and spake among themselves , as they stood in the temple , What think ye , that he will not come to the feast ?
BRG	John	11	57	Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should shew it , that they might take him . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	John	12	12	On the next day much people that were come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
BRG	John	12	2	There they made him a supper ; and Martha served : but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him .
BRG	John	12	3	Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
BRG	John	12	4	Then saith one of his disciples , Judas Iscariot , Simon ’ s son , which should betray him ,
BRG	John	12	5	Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence , and given to the poor ?
BRG	John	12	6	This he said , not that he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and bare what was put therein .
BRG	John	12	7	Then said Jesus , Let her alone : against the day of my burying hath she kept this .
BRG	John	12	8	For the poor always ye have with you ; but me ye have not always .
BRG	John	12	9	Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came not for Jesus ’ sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
BRG	John	12	10	But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death ;
BRG	John	12	11	Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away , and believed on Jesus .
BRG	John	12	13	Took branches of palm trees , and went forth to meet him , and cried , Hosanna : Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord .
BRG	John	12	14	And Jesus , when he had found a young ass , sat thereon ; as it is written ,
BRG	John	12	15	Fear not , daughter of Sion : behold , thy King cometh , sitting on an ass ’ s colt .
BRG	John	12	16	These things understood not his disciples at the first : but when Jesus was glorified , then remembered they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him .
BRG	John	12	17	The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , bare record .
BRG	John	12	18	For this cause the people also met him , for that they heard that he had done this miracle .
BRG	John	12	19	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves , Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ? behold , the world is gone after him .
BRG	John	12	20	And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast :
BRG	John	12	21	The same came therefore to Philip , which was of Bethsaida of Galilee , and desired him , saying , Sir , we would see Jesus .
BRG	John	12	22	Philip cometh and telleth Andrew : and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus .
BRG	John	12	23	And Jesus answered them , saying , The hour is come , that the Son of man should be glorified .
BRG	John	12	24	Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
BRG	John	12	25	He that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal .
BRG	John	12	26	If any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will my Father honour .
BRG	John	12	27	Now is my soul troubled ; and what shall I say ? Father , save me from this hour : but for this cause came I unto this hour .
BRG	John	12	28	Father , glorify thy name . Then came there a voice from heaven , saying , I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again .
BRG	John	12	29	The people therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it thundered : others said , An angel spake to him .
BRG	John	12	30	Jesus answered and said , This voice came not because of me , but for your sakes .
BRG	John	12	31	Now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
BRG	John	12	32	And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto me .
BRG	John	12	33	This he said , signifying what death he should die .
BRG	John	12	34	The people answered him , We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever : and how sayest thou , The Son of man must be lifted up ? who is this Son of man ?
BRG	John	12	35	Then Jesus said unto them , Yet a little while is the light with you . Walk while ye have the light , lest darkness come upon you : for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth .
BRG	John	12	36	While ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . These things spake Jesus , and departed , and did hide himself from them .
BRG	John	12	37	But though he had done so many miracles before them , yet they believed not on him :
BRG	John	12	38	That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spake , Lord , who hath believed our report ? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed ?
BRG	John	12	39	Therefore they could not believe , because that Esaias said again ,
BRG	John	12	40	He hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart ; that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and be converted , and I should heal them .
BRG	John	12	41	These things said Esaias , when he saw his glory , and spake of him .
BRG	John	12	42	Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue :
BRG	John	12	43	For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God .
BRG	John	12	44	Jesus cried and said , He that believeth on me , believeth not on me , but on him that sent me .
BRG	John	12	45	And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me .
BRG	John	12	46	I am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness .
BRG	John	12	47	And if any man hear my words , and believe not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
BRG	John	12	48	He that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
BRG	John	12	49	For I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
BRG	John	12	50	And I know that his commandment is life everlasting : whatsoever I speak therefore , even as the Father said unto me , so I speak . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	John	13	13	Ye call me Master and Lord : and ye say well ; for so I am .
BRG	John	13	2	And supper being ended , the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon ’ s son , to betray him ;
BRG	John	13	3	Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he was come from God , and went to God ;
BRG	John	13	4	He riseth from supper , and laid aside his garments ; and took a towel , and girded himself .
BRG	John	13	5	After that he poureth water into a bason , and began to wash the disciples ’ feet , and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded .
BRG	John	13	6	Then cometh he to Simon Peter : and Peter saith unto him , Lord , dost thou wash my feet ?
BRG	John	13	7	Jesus answered and said unto him , What I do thou knowest not now ; but thou shalt know hereafter .
BRG	John	13	8	Peter saith unto him , Thou shalt never wash my feet . Jesus answered him , If I wash thee not , thou hast no part with me .
BRG	John	13	9	Simon Peter saith unto him , Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head .
BRG	John	13	10	Jesus saith to him , He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet , but is clean every whit : and ye are clean , but not all .
BRG	John	13	11	For he knew who should betray him ; therefore said he , Ye are not all clean .
BRG	John	13	12	So after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was set down again , he said unto them , Know ye what I have done to you ?
BRG	John	13	14	If I then , your Lord and Master , have washed your feet ; ye also ought to wash one another ’ s feet .
BRG	John	13	15	For I have given you an example , that ye should do as I have done to you .
BRG	John	13	16	Verily , verily , I say unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him .
BRG	John	13	17	If ye know these things , happy are ye if ye do them .
BRG	John	13	18	I speak not of you all : I know whom I have chosen : but that the scripture may be fulfilled , He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me .
BRG	John	13	19	Now I tell you before it come , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that I am he .
BRG	John	13	20	Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
BRG	John	13	21	When Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in Spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
BRG	John	13	22	Then the disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake .
BRG	John	13	23	Now there was leaning on Jesus ’ bosom one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved .
BRG	John	13	24	Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake .
BRG	John	13	25	He then lying on Jesus ’ breast saith unto him , Lord , who is it ?
BRG	John	13	26	Jesus answered , He it is , to whom I shall give a sop , when I have dipped it . And when he had dipped the sop , he gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon .
BRG	John	13	27	And after the sop Satan entered into him . Then said Jesus unto him , That thou doest , do quickly .
BRG	John	13	28	Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him .
BRG	John	13	29	For some of them thought , because Judas had the bag , that Jesus had said unto him , Buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor .
BRG	John	13	30	He then having received the sop went immediately out : and it was night .
BRG	John	13	31	Therefore , when he was gone out , Jesus said , Now is the Son of man glorified , and God is glorified in him .
BRG	John	13	32	If God be glorified in him , God shall also glorify him in himself , and shall straightway glorify him .
BRG	John	13	33	Little children , yet a little while I am with you . Ye shall seek me : and as I said unto the Jews , Whither I go , ye can not come ; so now I say to you .
BRG	John	13	34	A new commandment I give unto you , That ye love one another ; as I have loved you , that ye also love one another .
BRG	John	13	35	By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another .
BRG	John	13	36	Simon Peter said unto him , Lord , whither goest thou ? Jesus answered him , Whither I go , thou canst not follow me now ; but thou shalt follow me afterwards .
BRG	John	13	37	Peter said unto him , Lord , why can not I follow thee now ? I will lay down my life for thy sake .
BRG	John	13	38	Jesus answered him , Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ? Verily , verily , I say unto thee , The cock shall not crow , till thou hast denied me thrice . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	John	14	21	He that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him .
BRG	John	14	22	Judas saith unto him , not Iscariot , Lord , how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us , and not unto the world ?
BRG	John	14	23	Jesus answered and said unto him , If a man love me , he will keep my words : and my Father will love him , and we will come unto him , and make our abode with him .

BRG	John	18	5	They answered him , Jesus of Nazareth . Jesus saith unto them , I am he . And Judas also , which betrayed him , stood with them .
BRG	John	18	6	As soon then as he had said unto them , I am he , they went backward , and fell to the ground .
BRG	John	18	7	Then asked he them again , Whom seek ye ? And they said , Jesus of Nazareth .
BRG	John	18	8	Jesus answered , I have told you that I am he : if therefore ye seek me , let these go their way :
BRG	John	18	9	That the saying might be fulfilled , which he spake , Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none .
BRG	John	18	10	Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it , and smote the high priest ’ s servant , and cut off his right ear . The servant ’ s name was Malchus .
BRG	John	18	11	Then said Jesus unto Peter , Put up thy sword into the sheath : the cup which my Father hath given me , shall I not drink it ?
BRG	John	18	12	Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus , and bound him ,
BRG	John	18	13	And led him away to Annas first ; for he was father in law to Caiaphas , which was the high priest that same year .
BRG	John	18	14	Now Caiaphas was he , which gave counsel to the Jews , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
BRG	John	18	15	And Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple : that disciple was known unto the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest .
BRG	John	18	16	But Peter stood at the door without . Then went out that other disciple , which was known unto the high priest , and spake unto her that kept the door , and brought in Peter .
BRG	John	18	17	Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter , Art not thou also one of this man ’ s disciples ? He saith , I am not .
BRG	John	18	19	The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples , and of his doctrine .
BRG	John	18	20	Jesus answered him , I spake openly to the world ; I ever taught in the synagogue , and in the temple , whither the Jews always resort ; and in secret have I said nothing .
BRG	John	18	21	Why askest thou me ? ask them which heard me , what I have said unto them : behold , they know what I said .
BRG	John	18	22	And when he had thus spoken , one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand , saying , Answerest thou the high priest so ?
BRG	John	18	23	Jesus answered him , If I have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil : but if well , why smitest thou me ?
BRG	John	18	24	Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest .
BRG	John	18	25	And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself . They said therefore unto him , Art not thou also one of his disciples ? He denied it , and said , I am not .
BRG	John	18	26	One of the servants of the high priest , being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off , saith , Did not I see thee in the garden with him ?
BRG	John	18	27	Peter then denied again : and immediately the cock crew .
BRG	John	18	28	Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover .
BRG	John	18	29	Pilate then went out unto them , and said , What accusation bring ye against this man ?
BRG	John	18	30	They answered and said unto him , If he were not a malefactor , we would not have delivered him up unto thee .
BRG	John	18	31	Then said Pilate unto them , Take ye him , and judge him according to your law . The Jews therefore said unto him , It is not lawful for us to put any man to death :
BRG	John	18	32	That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spake , signifying what death he should die .
BRG	John	18	33	Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again , and called Jesus , and said unto him , Art thou the King of the Jews ?
BRG	John	18	34	Jesus answered him , Sayest thou this thing of thyself , or did others tell it thee of me ?
BRG	John	18	35	Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me : what hast thou done ?
BRG	John	18	36	Jesus answered , My kingdom is not of this world : if my kingdom were of this world , then would my servants fight , that I should not be delivered to the Jews : but now is my kingdom not from hence .
BRG	John	18	37	Pilate therefore said unto him , Art thou a king then ? Jesus answered , Thou sayest that I am a king . To this end was I born , and for this cause came I into the world , that I should bear witness unto the truth . Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice .
BRG	John	18	38	Pilate saith unto him , What is truth ? And when he had said this , he went out again unto the Jews , and saith unto them , I find in him no fault at all .
BRG	John	18	39	But ye have a custom , that I should release unto you one at the passover : will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
BRG	John	18	40	Then cried they all again , saying , Not this man , but Barabbas . Now Barabbas was a robber . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	John	18	4145648	""
BRG	John	19	19	And Pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . And the writing was , Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews .
BRG	John	19	2	And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple robe ,
BRG	John	19	3	And said , Hail , King of the Jews ! and they smote him with their hands .
BRG	John	19	4	Pilate therefore went forth again , and saith unto them , Behold , I bring him forth to you , that ye may know that I find no fault in him .
BRG	John	19	5	Then came Jesus forth , wearing the crown of thorns , and the purple robe . And Pilate saith unto them , Behold the man !
BRG	John	19	6	When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him , they cried out , saying , Crucify him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Take ye him , and crucify him : for I find no fault in him .
BRG	John	19	7	The Jews answered him , We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God .
BRG	John	19	8	When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he was the more afraid ;
BRG	John	19	9	And went again into the judgment hall , and saith unto Jesus , Whence art thou ? But Jesus gave him no answer .
BRG	John	19	10	Then saith Pilate unto him , Speakest thou not unto me ? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee , and have power to release thee ?
BRG	John	19	11	Jesus answered , Thou couldest have no power at all against me , except it were given thee from above : therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin .
BRG	John	19	12	And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him : but the Jews cried out , saying , If thou let this man go , thou art not Caesar ’ s friend : whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar .
BRG	John	19	13	When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement , but in the Hebrew , Gabbatha .
BRG	John	19	14	And it was the preparation of the passover , and about the sixth hour : and he saith unto the Jews , Behold your King !
BRG	John	19	15	But they cried out , Away with him , away with him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Shall I crucify your King ? The chief priests answered , We have no king but Caesar .
BRG	John	19	16	Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified . And they took Jesus , and led him away .
BRG	John	19	17	And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha :
BRG	John	19	18	Where they crucified him , and two other with him , on either side one , and Jesus in the midst .
BRG	John	19	20	This title then read many of the Jews : for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in Hebrew , and Greek , and Latin .
BRG	John	19	21	Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate , Write not , The King of the Jews ; but that he said , I am King of the Jews .
BRG	John	19	22	Pilate answered , What I have written I have written .
BRG	John	19	23	Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took his garments , and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also his coat : now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout .
BRG	John	19	24	They said therefore among themselves , Let us not rend it , but cast lots for it , whose it shall be : that the scripture might be fulfilled , which saith , They parted my raiment among them , and for my vesture they did cast lots . These things therefore the soldiers did .
BRG	John	19	25	Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother ’ s sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene .
BRG	John	19	26	When Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son !
BRG	John	19	27	Then saith he to the disciple , Behold thy mother ! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home .
BRG	John	19	28	After this , Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished , that the scripture might be fulfilled , saith , I thirst .
BRG	John	19	29	Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a spunge with vinegar , and put it upon hyssop , and put it to his mouth .
BRG	John	19	30	When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , It is finished : and he bowed his head , and gave up the ghost .
BRG	John	19	31	The Jews therefore , because it was the preparation , that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day , ( for that sabbath day was an high day , ) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away .
BRG	John	19	32	Then came the soldiers , and brake the legs of the first , and of the other which was crucified with him .
BRG	John	19	33	But when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they brake not his legs :
BRG	John	19	34	But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side , and forthwith came there out blood and water .
BRG	John	19	35	And he that saw it bare record , and his record is true : and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye might believe .
BRG	John	19	36	For these things were done , that the scripture should be fulfilled , A bone of him shall not be broken .
BRG	John	19	37	And again another scripture saith , They shall look on him whom they pierced .
BRG	John	19	38	And after this Joseph of Arimathaea , being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus : and Pilate gave him leave . He came therefore , and took the body of Jesus .
BRG	John	19	39	And there came also Nicodemus , which at the first came to Jesus by night , and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight .
BRG	John	19	40	Then took they the body of Jesus , and wound it in linen clothes with the spices , as the manner of the Jews is to bury .
BRG	John	19	41	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the garden a new sepulchre , wherein was never man yet laid .
BRG	John	19	42	There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews ’ preparation day ; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	John	20	20	And when he had so said , he shewed unto them his hands and his side . Then were the disciples glad , when they saw the Lord .
BRG	John	20	2	Then she runneth , and cometh to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple , whom Jesus loved , and saith unto them , They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre , and we know not where they have laid him .
BRG	John	20	3	Peter therefore went forth , and that other disciple , and came to the sepulchre .
BRG	John	20	4	So they ran both together : and the other disciple did outrun Peter , and came first to the sepulchre .
BRG	John	20	5	And he stooping down , and looking in , saw the linen clothes lying ; yet went he not in .
BRG	John	20	6	Then cometh Simon Peter following him , and went into the sepulchre , and seeth the linen clothes lie ,
BRG	John	20	7	And the napkin , that was about his head , not lying with the linen clothes , but wrapped together in a place by itself .
BRG	John	20	8	Then went in also that other disciple , which came first to the sepulchre , and he saw , and believed .
BRG	John	20	9	For as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead .
BRG	John	20	10	Then the disciples went away again unto their own home .
BRG	John	20	11	But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping : and as she wept , she stooped down , and looked into the sepulchre ,
BRG	John	20	12	And seeth two angels in white sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
BRG	John	20	13	And they say unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? She saith unto them , Because they have taken away my Lord , and I know not where they have laid him .
BRG	John	20	14	And when she had thus said , she turned herself back , and saw Jesus standing , and knew not that it was Jesus .
BRG	John	20	15	Jesus saith unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? whom seekest thou ? She , supposing him to be the gardener , saith unto him , Sir , if thou have borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away .
BRG	John	20	16	Jesus saith unto her , Mary . She turned herself , and saith unto him , Rabboni ; which is to say , Master .
BRG	John	20	17	Jesus saith unto her , Touch me not ; for I am not yet ascended to my Father : but go to my brethren , and say unto them , I ascend unto my Father , and your Father ; and to my God , and your God .
BRG	John	20	18	Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord , and that he had spoken these things unto her .
BRG	John	20	19	Then the same day at evening , being the first day of the week , when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews , came Jesus and stood in the midst , and saith unto them , Peace be unto you .
BRG	John	20	21	Then said Jesus to them again , Peace be unto you : as my Father hath sent me , even so send I you .
BRG	John	20	22	And when he had said this , he breathed on them , and saith unto them , Receive ye the Holy Ghost :
BRG	John	20	23	Whose soever sins ye remit , they are remitted unto them ; and whose soever sins ye retain , they are retained .
BRG	John	20	24	But Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came .
BRG	John	20	25	The other disciples therefore said unto him , We have seen the Lord . But he said unto them , Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails , and put my finger into the print of the nails , and thrust my hand into his side , I will not believe .
BRG	John	20	26	And after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them : then came Jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be unto you .
BRG	John	20	27	Then saith he to Thomas , Reach hither thy finger , and behold my hands ; and reach hither thy hand , and thrust it into my side : and be not faithless , but believing .

BRG	John	21	21	Peter seeing him saith to Jesus , Lord , and what shall this man do ?
BRG	John	21	2	There were together Simon Peter , and Thomas called Didymus , and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee , and the sons of Zebedee , and two other of his disciples .
BRG	John	21	3	Simon Peter saith unto them , I go a fishing . They say unto him , We also go with thee . They went forth , and entered into a ship immediately ; and that night they caught nothing .
BRG	John	21	4	But when the morning was now come , Jesus stood on the shore : but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus .
BRG	John	21	5	Then Jesus saith unto them , Children , have ye any meat ? They answered him , No .
BRG	John	21	6	And he said unto them , Cast the net on the right side of the ship , and ye shall find . They cast therefore , and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes .
BRG	John	21	7	Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter , It is the Lord . Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord , he girt his fisher ’ s coat unto him , ( for he was naked , ) and did cast himself into the sea .
BRG	John	21	8	And the other disciples came in a little ship ; ( for they were not far from land , but as it were two hundred cubits , ) dragging the net with fishes .
BRG	John	21	9	As soon then as they were come to land , they saw a fire of coals there , and fish laid thereon , and bread .
BRG	John	21	10	Jesus saith unto them , Bring of the fish which ye have now caught .
BRG	John	21	11	Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great fishes , an hundred and fifty and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
BRG	John	21	12	Jesus saith unto them , Come and dine . And none of the disciples durst ask him , Who art thou ? knowing that it was the Lord .
BRG	John	21	13	Jesus then cometh , and taketh bread , and giveth them , and fish likewise .
BRG	John	21	14	This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples , after that he was risen from the dead .
BRG	John	21	15	So when they had dined , Jesus saith to Simon Peter , Simon , son of Jonas , lovest thou me more than these ? He saith unto him , Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I love thee . He saith unto him , Feed my lambs .
BRG	John	21	16	He saith to him again the second time , Simon , son of Jonas , lovest thou me ? He saith unto him , Yea , Lord ; thou knowest that I love thee . He saith unto him , Feed my sheep .
BRG	John	21	17	He saith unto him the third time , Simon , son of Jonas , lovest thou me ? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time , Lovest thou me ? And he said unto him , Lord , thou knowest all things ; thou knowest that I love thee . Jesus saith unto him , Feed my sheep .
BRG	John	21	18	Verily , verily , I say unto thee , When thou wast young , thou girdedst thyself , and walkedst whither thou wouldest : but when thou shalt be old , thou shalt stretch forth thy hands , and another shall gird thee , and carry thee whither thou wouldest not .

BRG	John	21	20	Then Peter , turning about , seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following ; which also leaned on his breast at supper , and said , Lord , which is he that betrayeth thee ?

BRG	John	21	23	Then went this saying abroad among the brethren , that that disciple should not die : yet Jesus said not unto him , He shall not die ; but , If I will that he tarry till I come , what is that to thee ?
BRG	John	21	24	This is the disciple which testifieth of these things , and wrote these things : and we know that his testimony is true .

BRG	Romans	1	2	( Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures , )
BRG	Romans	1	3	Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord , which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh ;
BRG	Romans	1	4	And declared to be the Son of God with power , according to the Spirit of holiness , by the resurrection from the dead :
BRG	Romans	1	5	By whom we have received grace and apostleship , for obedience to the faith among all nations , for his name :
BRG	Romans	1	6	Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ :
BRG	Romans	1	7	To all that be in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : Grace to you and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
BRG	Romans	1	8	First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all , that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world .
BRG	Romans	1	9	For God is my witness , whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son , that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers ;
BRG	Romans	1	10	Making request , if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you .
BRG	Romans	1	11	For I long to see you , that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift , to the end ye may be established ;
BRG	Romans	1	12	That is , that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me .
BRG	Romans	1	13	Now I would not have you ignorant , brethren , that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you , ( but was let hitherto , ) that I might have some fruit among you also , even as among other Gentiles .
BRG	Romans	1	14	I am debtor both to the Greeks , and to the Barbarians ; both to the wise , and to the unwise .
BRG	Romans	1	15	So , as much as in me is , I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also .
BRG	Romans	1	16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
BRG	Romans	1	17	For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith : as it is written , The just shall live by faith . ( A )
BRG	Romans	1	18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who hold the truth in unrighteousness ;
BRG	Romans	1	19	Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them ; for God hath shewed it unto them .
BRG	Romans	1	20	For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead ; so that they are without excuse :
BRG	Romans	1	21	Because that , when they knew God , they glorified him not as God , neither were thankful ; but became vain in their imaginations , and their foolish heart was darkened .
BRG	Romans	1	22	Professing themselves to be wise , they became fools ,
BRG	Romans	1	23	And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man , and to birds , and fourfooted beasts , and creeping things .
BRG	Romans	1	24	Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts , to dishonour their own bodies between themselves :
BRG	Romans	1	25	Who changed the truth of God into a lie , and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator , who is blessed for ever . Amen .
BRG	Romans	1	26	For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections : for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature :
BRG	Romans	1	27	And likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is unseemly , and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet .
BRG	Romans	1	28	And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them over to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not convenient ;
BRG	Romans	1	29	Being filled with all unrighteousness , fornication , wickedness , covetousness , maliciousness ; full of envy , murder , debate , deceit , malignity ; whisperers ,
BRG	Romans	1	30	Backbiters , haters of God , despiteful , proud , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
BRG	Romans	1	31	Without understanding , covenantbreakers , without natural affection , implacable , unmerciful :

BRG	Romans	2	2	But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things .
BRG	Romans	2	3	And thinkest thou this , O man , that judgest them which do such things , and doest the same , that thou shalt escape the judgment of God ?
BRG	Romans	2	4	Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering ; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance ?
BRG	Romans	2	5	But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God ;
BRG	Romans	2	6	Who will render to every man according to his deeds :
BRG	Romans	2	7	To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality , eternal life :

BRG	Romans	2	9	Tribulation and anguish , upon every soul of man that doeth evil , of the Jew first , and also of the Gentile ;
BRG	Romans	2	10	But glory , honour , and peace , to every man that worketh good , to the Jew first , and also to the Gentile :
BRG	Romans	2	11	For there is no respect of persons with God .
BRG	Romans	2	12	For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law : and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law ;
BRG	Romans	2	13	( For not the hearers of the law are just before God , but the doers of the law shall be justified .
BRG	Romans	2	14	For when the Gentiles , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , these , having not the law , are a law unto themselves :
BRG	Romans	2	15	Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience also bearing witness , and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another ; )
BRG	Romans	2	16	In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel .
BRG	Romans	2	17	Behold , thou art called a Jew , and restest in the law , and makest thy boast of God ,
BRG	Romans	2	18	And knowest his will , and approvest the things that are more excellent , being instructed out of the law ;
BRG	Romans	2	19	And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind , a light of them which are in darkness ,
BRG	Romans	2	20	An instructor of the foolish , a teacher of babes , which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law .
BRG	Romans	2	21	Thou therefore which teachest another , teachest thou not thyself ? thou that preachest a man should not steal , dost thou steal ?
BRG	Romans	2	22	Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery , dost thou commit adultery ? thou that abhorrest idols , dost thou commit sacrilege ?
BRG	Romans	2	23	Thou that makest thy boast of the law , through breaking the law dishonourest thou God ?

BRG	Romans	2	25	For circumcision verily profiteth , if thou keep the law : but if thou be a breaker of the law , thy circumcision is made uncircumcision .
BRG	Romans	2	26	Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law , shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision ?
BRG	Romans	2	27	And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature , if it fulfil the law , judge thee , who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law ?

BRG	Romans	3	3	For what if some did not believe ? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect ?
BRG	Romans	3	2	Much every way : chiefly , because that unto them were committed the oracles of God .
BRG	Romans	3	4	God forbid : yea , let God be true , but every man a liar ; as it is written , That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings , and mightest overcome when thou art judged .
BRG	Romans	3	5	But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God , what shall we say ? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance ? ( I speak as a man )
BRG	Romans	3	6	God forbid : for then how shall God judge the world ?
BRG	Romans	3	7	For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory ; why yet am I also judged as a sinner ?
BRG	Romans	3	8	And not rather , ( as we be slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say , ) Let us do evil , that good may come ? whose damnation is just .
BRG	Romans	3	9	What then ? are we better than they ? No , in no wise : for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles , that they are all under sin ;
BRG	Romans	3	10	As it is written , There is none righteous , no , not one :
BRG	Romans	3	11	There is none that understandeth , there is none that seeketh after God .
BRG	Romans	3	12	They are all gone out of the way , they are together become unprofitable ; there is none that doeth good , no , not one .
BRG	Romans	3	13	Their throat is an open sepulchre ; with their tongues they have used deceit ; the poison of asps is under their lips :
BRG	Romans	3	14	Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness :
BRG	Romans	3	15	Their feet are swift to shed blood :
BRG	Romans	3	16	Destruction and misery are in their ways :
BRG	Romans	3	17	And the way of peace have they not known :
BRG	Romans	3	18	There is no fear of God before their eyes .
BRG	Romans	3	19	Now we know that what things soever the law saith , it saith to them who are under the law : that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God .
BRG	Romans	3	20	Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight : for by the law is the knowledge of sin .
BRG	Romans	3	21	But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested , being witnessed by the law and the prophets ;
BRG	Romans	3	22	Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe : for there is no difference :
BRG	Romans	3	23	For all have sinned , and come short of the glory of God ;
BRG	Romans	3	24	Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus :
BRG	Romans	3	25	Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood , to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past , through the forbearance of God ;
BRG	Romans	3	26	To declare , I say , at this time his righteousness : that he might be just , and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus .
BRG	Romans	3	27	Where is boasting then ? It is excluded . By what law ? of works ? Nay : but by the law of faith .
BRG	Romans	3	28	Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law .
BRG	Romans	3	29	Is he the God of the Jews only ? is he not also of the Gentiles ? Yes , of the Gentiles also :
BRG	Romans	3	30	Seeing it is one God , which shall justify the circumcision by faith , and uncircumcision through faith .
BRG	Romans	3	31	Do we then make void the law through faith ? God forbid : yea , we establish the law . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Romans	4	4	Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace , but of debt .
BRG	Romans	4	2	For if Abraham were justified by works , he hath whereof to glory ; but not before God .
BRG	Romans	4	3	For what saith the scripture ? Abraham believed God , and it was counted unto him for righteousness .
BRG	Romans	4	5	But to him that worketh not , but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly , his faith is counted for righteousness .
BRG	Romans	4	6	Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man , unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works ,
BRG	Romans	4	7	Saying , Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven , and whose sins are covered .
BRG	Romans	4	8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin .
BRG	Romans	4	9	Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only , or upon the uncircumcision also ? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness .
BRG	Romans	4	10	How was it then reckoned ? when he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ? Not in circumcision , but in uncircumcision .
BRG	Romans	4	11	And he received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised : that he might be the father of all them that believe , though they be not circumcised ; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also :
BRG	Romans	4	12	And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had being yet uncircumcised .
BRG	Romans	4	13	For the promise , that he should be the heir of the world , was not to Abraham , or to his seed , through the law , but through the righteousness of faith .
BRG	Romans	4	14	For if they which are of the law be heirs , faith is made void , and the promise made of none effect :
BRG	Romans	4	15	Because the law worketh wrath : for where no law is , there is no transgression .
BRG	Romans	4	16	Therefore it is of faith , that it might be by grace ; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed ; not to that only which is of the law , but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham ; who is the father of us all ,
BRG	Romans	4	17	( As it is written , I have made thee a father of many nations , ) before him whom he believed , even God , who quickeneth the dead , and calleth those things which be not as though they were . ( A )
BRG	Romans	4	18	Who against hope believed in hope , that he might become the father of many nations , according to that which was spoken , So shall thy seed be . ( B )
BRG	Romans	4	19	And being not weak in faith , he considered not his own body now dead , when he was about an hundred years old , neither yet the deadness of Sara ’ s womb :
BRG	Romans	4	20	He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief ; but was strong in faith , giving glory to God ;
BRG	Romans	4	21	And being fully persuaded that , what he had promised , he was able also to perform .
BRG	Romans	4	22	And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness .
BRG	Romans	4	23	Now it was not written for his sake alone , that it was imputed to him ;
BRG	Romans	4	24	But for us also , to whom it shall be imputed , if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead ;
BRG	Romans	4	25	Who was delivered for our offences , and was raised again for our justification . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Romans	5	5	And hope maketh not ashamed ; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us .
BRG	Romans	5	2	By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand , and rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
BRG	Romans	5	3	And not only so , but we glory in tribulations also : knowing that tribulation worketh patience ;
BRG	Romans	5	4	And patience , experience ; and experience , hope :
BRG	Romans	5	6	For when we were yet without strength , in due time Christ died for the ungodly .
BRG	Romans	5	7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die : yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die .
BRG	Romans	5	8	But God commendeth his love toward us , in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us .
BRG	Romans	5	9	Much more then , being now justified by his blood , we shall be saved from wrath through him .
BRG	Romans	5	10	For if , when we were enemies , we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we shall be saved by his life .
BRG	Romans	5	11	And not only so , but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom we have now received the atonement .
BRG	Romans	5	12	Wherefore , as by one man sin entered into the world , and death by sin ; and so death passed upon all men , for that all have sinned :
BRG	Romans	5	13	( For until the law sin was in the world : but sin is not imputed when there is no law .
BRG	Romans	5	14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses , even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam ’ s transgression , who is the figure of him that was to come .
BRG	Romans	5	15	But not as the offence , so also is the free gift . For if through the offence of one many be dead , much more the grace of God , and the gift by grace , which is by one man , Jesus Christ , hath abounded unto many .
BRG	Romans	5	16	And not as it was by one that sinned , so is the gift : for the judgment was by one to condemnation , but the free gift is of many offences unto justification .
BRG	Romans	5	17	For if by one man ’ s offence death reigned by one ; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one , Jesus Christ . )
BRG	Romans	5	18	Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation ; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life .
BRG	Romans	5	19	For as by one man ’ s disobedience many were made sinners , so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous .
BRG	Romans	5	20	Moreover the law entered , that the offence might abound . But where sin abounded , grace did much more abound :
BRG	Romans	5	21	That as sin hath reigned unto death , even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Romans	6	3	Know ye not , that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death ?
BRG	Romans	6	4	Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death : that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father , even so we also should walk in newness of life .
BRG	Romans	6	5	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death , we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection :

BRG	Romans	7	7	What shall we say then ? Is the law sin ? God forbid . Nay , I had not known sin , but by the law : for I had not known lust , except the law had said , Thou shalt not covet . ( A )

BRG	Romans	7	3	So then if , while her husband liveth , she be married to another man , she shall be called an adulteress : but if her husband be dead , she is free from that law ; so that she is no adulteress , though she be married to another man .
BRG	Romans	7	4	Wherefore , my brethren , ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ ; that ye should be married to another , even to him who is raised from the dead , that we should bring forth fruit unto God .
BRG	Romans	7	5	For when we were in the flesh , the motions of sins , which were by the law , did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death .
BRG	Romans	7	6	But now we are delivered from the law , that being dead wherein we were held ; that we should serve in newness of Spirit , and not in the oldness of the letter .
BRG	Romans	7	8	But sin , taking occasion by the commandment , wrought in me all manner of concupiscence . For without the law sin was dead .
BRG	Romans	7	9	For I was alive without the law once : but when the commandment came , sin revived , and I died .
BRG	Romans	7	10	And the commandment , which was ordained to life , I found to be unto death .
BRG	Romans	7	11	For sin , taking occasion by the commandment , deceived me , and by it slew me .
BRG	Romans	7	12	Wherefore the law is holy , and the commandment holy , and just , and good .
BRG	Romans	7	13	Was then that which is good made death unto me ? God forbid . But sin , that it might appear sin , working death in me by that which is good ; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful .

BRG	Romans	8	8	So then they that are in the flesh can not please God .
BRG	Romans	8	2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death .
BRG	Romans	8	3	For what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh :
BRG	Romans	8	4	That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
BRG	Romans	8	5	For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh ; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit .
BRG	Romans	8	6	For to be carnally minded is death ; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace .
BRG	Romans	8	7	Because the carnal mind is enmity against God : for it is not subject to the law of God , neither indeed can be .
BRG	Romans	8	9	But ye are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you . Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his .
BRG	Romans	8	10	And if Christ be in you , the body is dead because of sin ; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness .
BRG	Romans	8	11	But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you , he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you .
BRG	Romans	8	12	Therefore , brethren , we are debtors , not to the flesh , to live after the flesh .

BRG	Romans	8	14	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God , they are the sons of God .
BRG	Romans	8	15	For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear ; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption , whereby we cry , Abba , Father .
BRG	Romans	8	16	The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit , that we are the children of God :
BRG	Romans	8	17	And if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint-heirs with Christ ; if so be that we suffer with him , that we may be also glorified together .
BRG	Romans	8	18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us .
BRG	Romans	8	19	For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God .
BRG	Romans	8	20	For the creature was made subject to vanity , not willingly , but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope ,
BRG	Romans	8	21	Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God .
BRG	Romans	8	22	For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now .
BRG	Romans	8	23	And not only they , but ourselves also , which have the firstfruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to wit , the redemption of our body .
BRG	Romans	8	24	For we are saved by hope : but hope that is seen is not hope : for what a man seeth , why doth he yet hope for ?
BRG	Romans	8	25	But if we hope for that we see not , then do we with patience wait for it .
BRG	Romans	8	26	Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities : for we know not what we should pray for as we ought : but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which can not be uttered .
BRG	Romans	8	27	And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit , because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God .
BRG	Romans	8	28	And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God , to them who are the called according to his purpose .
BRG	Romans	8	29	For whom he did foreknow , he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son , that he might be the firstborn among many brethren .
BRG	Romans	8	30	Moreover whom he did predestinate , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also justified : and whom he justified , them he also glorified .
BRG	Romans	8	31	What shall we then say to these things ? If God be for us , who can be against us ?
BRG	Romans	8	32	He that spared not his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how shall he not with him also freely give us all things ?
BRG	Romans	8	33	Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God ’ s elect ? It is God that justifieth .
BRG	Romans	8	34	Who is he that condemneth ? It is Christ that died , yea rather , that is risen again , who is even at the right hand of God , who also maketh intercession for us .
BRG	Romans	8	35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or peril , or sword ?
BRG	Romans	8	36	As it is written , For thy sake we are killed all the day long ; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter .

BRG	Romans	10	4	For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth .
BRG	Romans	10	5	For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law , That the man which doeth those things shall live by them .
BRG	Romans	10	6	But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise , Say not in thine heart , Who shall ascend into heaven ? ( that is , to bring Christ down from above : )
BRG	Romans	10	7	Or , Who shall descend into the deep ? ( that is , to bring up Christ again from the dead . )
BRG	Romans	10	8	But what saith it ? The word is nigh thee , even in thy mouth , and in thy heart : that is , the word of faith , which we preach ;
BRG	Romans	10	9	That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead , thou shalt be saved .
BRG	Romans	10	11	For the scripture saith , Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed .
BRG	Romans	10	12	For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek : for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him .
BRG	Romans	10	13	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved .
BRG	Romans	10	14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher ?
BRG	Romans	10	15	And how shall they preach , except they be sent ? as it is written , How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace , and bring glad tidings of good things !
BRG	Romans	10	16	But they have not all obeyed the gospel . For Esaias saith , Lord , who hath believed our report ?
BRG	Romans	10	17	So then faith cometh by hearing , and hearing by the word of God .
BRG	Romans	10	18	But I say , Have they not heard ? Yes verily , their sound went into all the earth , and their words unto the ends of the world .
BRG	Romans	10	19	But I say , Did not Israel know ? First Moses saith , I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people , and by a foolish nation I will anger you . ( A )
BRG	Romans	10	20	But Esaias is very bold , and saith , I was found of them that sought me not ; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me . ( B )
BRG	Romans	10	21	But to Israel he saith , All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people . ( C ) Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Romans	11	11	I say then , Have they stumbled that they should fall ? God forbid : but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles , for to provoke them to jealousy .
BRG	Romans	11	2	God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew . Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias ? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel , saying ,
BRG	Romans	11	3	Lord , they have killed thy prophets , and digged down thine altars ; and I am left alone , and they seek my life .
BRG	Romans	11	4	But what saith the answer of God unto him ? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal . ( A )
BRG	Romans	11	5	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace .
BRG	Romans	11	6	And if by grace , then is it no more of works : otherwise grace is no more grace . But if it be of works , then is it no more grace : otherwise work is no more work .
BRG	Romans	11	7	What then ? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for ; but the election hath obtained it , and the rest were blinded
BRG	Romans	11	8	( According as it is written , God hath given them the spirit of slumber , eyes that they should not see , and ears that they should not hear ; ) unto this day .
BRG	Romans	11	9	And David saith , Let their table be made a snare , and a trap , and a stumblingblock , and a recompence unto them :
BRG	Romans	11	10	Let their eyes be darkened , that they may not see , and bow down their back alway .
BRG	Romans	11	12	Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world , and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles ; how much more their fulness ?
BRG	Romans	11	13	For I speak to you Gentiles , inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles , I magnify mine office :
BRG	Romans	11	14	If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh , and might save some of them .
BRG	Romans	11	15	For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world , what shall the receiving of them be , but life from the dead ?
BRG	Romans	11	16	For if the firstfruit be holy , the lump is also holy : and if the root be holy , so are the branches .
BRG	Romans	11	17	And if some of the branches be broken off , and thou , being a wild olive tree , wert graffed in among them , and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree ;
BRG	Romans	11	18	Boast not against the branches . But if thou boast , thou bearest not the root , but the root thee .
BRG	Romans	11	19	Thou wilt say then , The branches were broken off , that I might be graffed in .
BRG	Romans	11	20	Well ; because of unbelief they were broken off , and thou standest by faith . Be not highminded , but fear :
BRG	Romans	11	21	For if God spared not the natural branches , take heed lest he also spare not thee .
BRG	Romans	11	22	Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God : on them which fell , severity ; but toward thee , goodness , if thou continue in his goodness : otherwise thou also shalt be cut off .
BRG	Romans	11	23	And they also , if they abide not still in unbelief , shall be graffed in : for God is able to graff them in again .
BRG	Romans	11	24	For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature , and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree : how much more shall these , which be the natural branches , be graffed into their own olive tree ?
BRG	Romans	11	25	For I would not , brethren , that ye should be ignorant of this mystery , lest ye should be wise in your own conceits ; that blindness in part is happened to Israel , until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in .
BRG	Romans	11	26	And so all Israel shall be saved : as it is written , There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer , and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob : ( B )
BRG	Romans	11	27	For this is my covenant unto them , when I shall take away their sins . ( C )
BRG	Romans	11	28	As concerning the gospel , they are enemies for your sakes : but as touching the election , they are beloved for the fathers ’ sakes .
BRG	Romans	11	29	For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance .
BRG	Romans	11	30	For as ye in times past have not believed God , yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief :
BRG	Romans	11	31	Even so have these also now not believed , that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy .
BRG	Romans	11	32	For God hath concluded them all in unbelief , that he might have mercy upon all .
BRG	Romans	11	33	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! how unsearchable are his judgments , and his ways past finding out !
BRG	Romans	11	34	For who hath known the mind of the Lord ? or who hath been his counsellor ?
BRG	Romans	11	35	Or who hath first given to him , and it shall be recompensed unto him again ?
BRG	Romans	11	36	For of him , and through him , and to him , are all things : to whom be glory for ever . Amen . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Romans	12	3	For I say , through the grace given unto me , to every man that is among you , not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think ; but to think soberly , according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith .
BRG	Romans	12	4	For as we have many members in one body , and all members have not the same office :

BRG	Romans	12	17	Recompense to no man evil for evil . Provide things honest in the sight of all men .
BRG	Romans	12	18	If it be possible , as much as lieth in you , live peaceably with all men .

BRG	Romans	13	2	Whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God : and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation .
BRG	Romans	13	3	For rulers are not a terror to good works , but to the evil . Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power ? do that which is good , and thou shalt have praise of the same :
BRG	Romans	13	4	For he is the minister of God to thee for good . But if thou do that which is evil , be afraid ; for he beareth not the sword in vain : for he is the minister of God , a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil .
BRG	Romans	13	5	Wherefore ye must needs be subject , not only for wrath , but also for conscience sake .
BRG	Romans	13	6	For for this cause pay ye tribute also : for they are God ’ s ministers , attending continually upon this very thing .

BRG	Romans	14	14	I know , and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus , that there is nothing unclean of itself : but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean , to him it is unclean .

BRG	Romans	14	3	Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not ; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth : for God hath received him .

BRG	Romans	14	9	For to this end Christ both died , and rose , and revived , that he might be Lord both of the dead and living .
BRG	Romans	14	10	But why dost thou judge thy brother ? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother ? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
BRG	Romans	14	11	For it is written , As I live , saith the Lord , every knee shall bow to me , and every tongue shall confess to God . ( A )
BRG	Romans	14	12	So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God .
BRG	Romans	14	13	Let us not therefore judge one another any more : but judge this rather , that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother ’ s way .

BRG	Romans	14	16	Let not then your good be evil spoken of :
BRG	Romans	14	17	For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink ; but righteousness , and peace , and joy in the Holy Ghost .
BRG	Romans	14	18	For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God , and approved of men .
BRG	Romans	14	19	Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace , and things wherewith one may edify another .

BRG	Romans	15	15	Nevertheless , brethren , I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me of God ,
BRG	Romans	15	2	Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification .
BRG	Romans	15	3	For even Christ pleased not himself ; but , as it is written , The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me .
BRG	Romans	15	4	For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning , that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope .
BRG	Romans	15	5	Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus :
BRG	Romans	15	6	That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
BRG	Romans	15	7	Wherefore receive ye one another , as Christ also received us to the glory of God .
BRG	Romans	15	8	Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God , to confirm the promises made unto the fathers :
BRG	Romans	15	9	And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy ; as it is written , For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles , and sing unto thy name .

BRG	Romans	15	13	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that ye may abound in hope , through the power of the Holy Ghost .
BRG	Romans	15	14	And I myself also am persuaded of you , my brethren , that ye also are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admonish one another .
BRG	Romans	15	16	That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles , ministering the gospel of God , that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable , being sanctified by the Holy Ghost .
BRG	Romans	15	17	I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God .
BRG	Romans	15	18	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me , to make the Gentiles obedient , by word and deed ,
BRG	Romans	15	19	Through mighty signs and wonders , by the power of the Spirit of God ; so that from Jerusalem , and round about unto Illyricum , I have fully preached the gospel of Christ .
BRG	Romans	15	20	Yea , so have I strived to preach the gospel , not where Christ was named , lest I should build upon another man ’ s foundation :
BRG	Romans	15	21	But as it is written , To whom he was not spoken of , they shall see : and they that have not heard shall understand . ( B )
BRG	Romans	15	22	For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you .
BRG	Romans	15	23	But now having no more place in these parts , and having a great desire these many years to come unto you ;
BRG	Romans	15	24	Whensoever I take my journey into Spain , I will come to you : for I trust to see you in my journey , and to be brought on my way thitherward by you , if first I be somewhat filled with your company .
BRG	Romans	15	25	But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints .
BRG	Romans	15	26	For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem .
BRG	Romans	15	27	It hath pleased them verily ; and their debtors they are . For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things .
BRG	Romans	15	28	When therefore I have performed this , and have sealed to them this fruit , I will come by you into Spain .
BRG	Romans	15	29	And I am sure that , when I come unto you , I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ .

BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	2	Unto the church of God which is at Corinth , to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus , called to be saints , with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord , both their ’ s and our ’ s :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	3	Grace be unto you , and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	4	I thank my God always on your behalf , for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ ;

BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	6	Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	7	So that ye come behind in no gift ; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	8	Who shall also confirm you unto the end , that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	9	God is faithful , by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	10	Now I beseech you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you ; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	11	For it hath been declared unto me of you , my brethren , by them which are of the house of Chloe , that there are contentions among you .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	12	Now this I say , that every one of you saith , I am of Paul ; and I of Apollos ; and I of Cephas ; and I of Christ .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	13	Is Christ divided ? was Paul crucified for you ? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	14	I thank God that I baptized none of you , but Crispus and Gaius ;
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	15	Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanas : besides , I know not whether I baptized any other .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	17	For Christ sent me not to baptize , but to preach the gospel : not with wisdom of words , lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	18	For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness ; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	19	For it is written , I will destroy the wisdom of the wise , and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent . ( A )
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	20	Where is the wise ? where is the scribe ? where is the disputer of this world ? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	21	For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God , it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	22	For the Jews require a sign , and the Greeks seek after wisdom :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	1	23	But we preach Christ crucified , unto the Jews a stumblingblock , and unto the Greeks foolishness ;

BRG	1%20Corinthians	2	2	For I determined not to know any thing among you , save Jesus Christ , and him crucified .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	2	3	And I was with you in weakness , and in fear , and in much trembling .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	2	4	And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man ’ s wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	2	5	That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	2	6	Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect : yet not the wisdom of this world , nor of the princes of this world , that come to nought :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	2	7	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery , even the hidden wisdom , which God ordained before the world unto our glory :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	2	8	Which none of the princes of this world knew : for had they known it , they would not have crucified the Lord of glory .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	2	9	But as it is written , Eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , neither have entered into the heart of man , the things which God hath prepared for them that love him .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	2	10	But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit : for the Spirit searcheth all things , yea , the deep things of God .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	2	11	For what man knoweth the things of a man , save the spirit of man which is in him ? even so the things of God knoweth no man , but the Spirit of God .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	2	12	Now we have received , not the spirit of the world , but the Spirit which is of God ; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	2	13	Which things also we speak , not in the words which man ’ s wisdom teacheth , but which the Holy Ghost teacheth ; comparing spiritual things with spiritual .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	2	14	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God : for they are foolishness unto him : neither can he know them , because they are spiritually discerned .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	2	15	But he that is spiritual judgeth all things , yet he himself is judged of no man .

BRG	1%20Corinthians	3	8	Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one : and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour .

BRG	1%20Corinthians	3	10	According to the grace of God which is given unto me , as a wise masterbuilder , I have laid the foundation , and another buildeth thereon . But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	3	11	For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid , which is Jesus Christ .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	3	12	Now if any man build upon this foundation gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , stubble ;
BRG	1%20Corinthians	3	13	Every man ’ s work shall be made manifest : for the day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire ; and the fire shall try every man ’ s work of what sort it is .

BRG	1%20Corinthians	3	15	If any man ’ s work shall be burned , he shall suffer loss : but he himself shall be saved ; yet so as by fire .

BRG	1%20Corinthians	3	17	If any man defile the temple of God , him shall God destroy ; for the temple of God is holy , which temple ye are .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	3	18	Let no man deceive himself . If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world , let him become a fool , that he may be wise .

BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	7	For I would that all men were even as I myself . But every man hath his proper gift of God , one after this manner , and another after that .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	2	Nevertheless , to avoid fornication , let every man have his own wife , and let every woman have her own husband .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	3	Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence : and likewise also the wife unto the husband .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	4	The wife hath not power of her own body , but the husband : and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body , but the wife .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	5	Defraud ye not one the other , except it be with consent for a time , that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer ; and come together again , that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	6	But I speak this by permission , and not of commandment .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	8	I say therefore to the unmarried and widows , It is good for them if they abide even as I .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	9	But if they can not contain , let them marry : for it is better to marry than to burn .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	10	And unto the married I command , yet not I , but the Lord , Let not the wife depart from her husband :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	11	But and if she depart , let her remain unmarried , or be reconciled to her husband : and let not the husband put away his wife .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	12	But to the rest speak I , not the Lord : If any brother hath a wife that believeth not , and she be pleased to dwell with him , let him not put her away .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	13	And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not , and if he be pleased to dwell with her , let her not leave him .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband : else were your children unclean ; but now are they holy .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	15	But if the unbelieving depart , let him depart . A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases : but God hath called us to peace .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	16	For what knowest thou , O wife , whether thou shalt save thy husband ? or how knowest thou , O man , whether thou shalt save thy wife ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	17	But as God hath distributed to every man , as the Lord hath called every one , so let him walk . And so ordain I in all churches .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	18	Is any man called being circumcised ? let him not become uncircumcised . Is any called in uncircumcision ? let him not be circumcised .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	19	Circumcision is nothing , and uncircumcision is nothing , but the keeping of the commandments of God .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	20	Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	21	Art thou called being a servant ? care not for it : but if thou mayest be made free , use it rather .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	22	For he that is called in the Lord , being a servant , is the Lord ’ s freeman : likewise also he that is called , being free , is Christ ’ s servant .

BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	26	I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress , I say , that it is good for a man so to be .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	27	Art thou bound unto a wife ? seek not to be loosed . Art thou loosed from a wife ? seek not a wife .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	28	But and if thou marry , thou hast not sinned ; and if a virgin marry , she hath not sinned . Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh : but I spare you .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	29	But this I say , brethren , the time is short : it remaineth , that both they that have wives be as though they had none ;
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	30	And they that weep , as though they wept not ; and they that rejoice , as though they rejoiced not ; and they that buy , as though they possessed not ;
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	31	And they that use this world , as not abusing it : for the fashion of this world passeth away .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	32	But I would have you without carefulness . He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord , how he may please the Lord :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	33	But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world , how he may please his wife .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	34	There is difference also between a wife and a virgin . The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord , that she may be holy both in body and in spirit : but she that is married careth for the things of the world , how she may please her husband .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	35	And this I speak for your own profit ; not that I may cast a snare upon you , but for that which is comely , and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	36	But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin , if she pass the flower of her age , and need so require , let him do what he will , he sinneth not : let them marry .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	37	Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart , having no necessity , but hath power over his own will , and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin , doeth well .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	38	So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well ; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	7	39	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth ; but if her husband be dead , she is at liberty to be married to whom she will ; only in the Lord .

BRG	1%20Corinthians	9	19	For though I be free from all men , yet have I made myself servant unto all , that I might gain the more .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	9	20	And unto the Jews I became as a Jew , that I might gain the Jews ; to them that are under the law , as under the law , that I might gain them that are under the law ;
BRG	1%20Corinthians	9	21	To them that are without law , as without law , ( being not without law to God , but under the law to Christ , ) that I might gain them that are without law .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	9	22	To the weak became I as weak , that I might gain the weak : I am made all things to all men , that I might by all means save some .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	9	23	And this I do for the gospel ’ s sake , that I might be partaker thereof with you .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	9	24	Know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ? So run , that ye may obtain .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	9	25	And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things . Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown ; but we an incorruptible .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	9	26	I therefore so run , not as uncertainly ; so fight I , not as one that beateth the air :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	9	27	But I keep under my body , and bring it into subjection : lest that by any means , when I have preached to others , I myself should be a castaway . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	10	Neither murmur ye , as some of them also murmured , and were destroyed of the destroyer .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	2	And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea ;
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	3	And did all eat the same spiritual meat ;
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	4	And did all drink the same spiritual drink : for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them : and that Rock was Christ .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	5	But with many of them God was not well pleased : for they were overthrown in the wilderness .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	6	Now these things were our examples , to the intent we should not lust after evil things , as they also lusted .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	7	Neither be ye idolaters , as were some of them ; as it is written , The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	8	Neither let us commit fornication , as some of them committed , and fell in one day three and twenty thousand .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	9	Neither let us tempt Christ , as some of them also tempted , and were destroyed of serpents .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	11	Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples : and they are written for our admonition , upon whom the ends of the world are come .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	12	Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	13	There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man : but God is faithful , who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able ; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape , that ye may be able to bear it .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	14	Wherefore , my dearly beloved , flee from idolatry .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	15	I speak as to wise men ; judge ye what I say .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	16	The cup of blessing which we bless , is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? The bread which we break , is it not the communion of the body of Christ ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	17	For we being many are one bread , and one body : for we are all partakers of that one bread .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	18	Behold Israel after the flesh : are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	19	What say I then ? that the idol is any thing , or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	20	But I say , that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to devils , and not to God : and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	21	Ye can not drink the cup of the Lord , and the cup of devils : ye can not be partakers of the Lord ’ s table , and of the table of devils .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	22	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? are we stronger than he ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	23	All things are lawful for me , but all things are not expedient : all things are lawful for me , but all things edify not .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	24	Let no man seek his own , but every man another ’ s wealth .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	25	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles , that eat , asking no question for conscience sake :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	26	For the earth is the Lord ’ s , and the fulness thereof .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	27	If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast , and ye be disposed to go ; whatsoever is set before you , eat , asking no question for conscience sake .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	28	But if any man say unto you , This is offered in sacrifice unto idols , eat not for his sake that shewed it , and for conscience sake : for the earth is the Lord ’ s , and the fulness thereof :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	29	Conscience , I say , not thine own , but of the other : for why is my liberty judged of another man ’ s conscience ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	30	For if I by grace be a partaker , why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	31	Whether therefore ye eat , or drink , or whatsoever ye do , do all to the glory of God .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	10	32	Give none offence , neither to the Jews , nor to the Gentiles , nor to the church of God :

BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	11	Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman , neither the woman without the man , in the Lord .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	2	Now I praise you , brethren , that ye remember me in all things , and keep the ordinances , as I delivered them to you .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	3	But I would have you know , that the head of every man is Christ ; and the head of the woman is the man ; and the head of Christ is God .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	4	Every man praying or prophesying , having his head covered , dishonoureth his head .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	5	But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head : for that is even all one as if she were shaven .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	6	For if the woman be not covered , let her also be shorn : but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven , let her be covered .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	7	For a man indeed ought not to cover his head , forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	8	For the man is not of the woman ; but the woman of the man .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	9	Neither was the man created for the woman ; but the woman for the man .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	10	For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	12	For as the woman is of the man , even so is the man also by the woman ; but all things of God .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	13	Judge in yourselves : is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	14	Doth not even nature itself teach you , that , if a man have long hair , it is a shame unto him ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	15	But if a woman have long hair , it is a glory to her : for her hair is given her for a covering .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	16	But if any man seem to be contentious , we have no such custom , neither the churches of God .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	17	Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not , that ye come together not for the better , but for the worse .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	18	For first of all , when ye come together in the church , I hear that there be divisions among you ; and I partly believe it .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	19	For there must be also heresies among you , that they which are approved may be made manifest among you .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	20	When ye come together therefore into one place , this is not to eat the Lord ’ s supper .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	21	For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper : and one is hungry , and another is drunken .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	22	What ? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in ? or despise ye the church of God , and shame them that have not ? What shall I say to you ? shall I praise you in this ? I praise you not .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	23	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you , That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	24	And when he had given thanks , he brake it , and said , Take , eat : this is my body , which is broken for you : this do in remembrance of me .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	25	After the same manner also he took the cup , when he had supped , saying , This cup is the new testament in my blood : this do ye , as oft as ye drink it , in remembrance of me .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	26	For as often as ye eat this bread , and drink this cup , ye do shew the Lord ’ s death till he come .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	27	Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread , and drink this cup of the Lord , unworthily , shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	28	But let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of that bread , and drink of that cup .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	29	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily , eateth and drinketh damnation to himself , not discerning the Lord ’ s body .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	30	For this cause many are weak and sickly among you , and many sleep .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	31	For if we would judge ourselves , we should not be judged .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	32	But when we are judged , we are chastened of the Lord , that we should not be condemned with the world .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	33	Wherefore , my brethren , when ye come together to eat , tarry one for another .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	11	34	And if any man hunger , let him eat at home ; that ye come not together unto condemnation . And the rest will I set in order when I come . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	12	For as the body is one , and hath many members , and all the members of that one body , being many , are one body : so also is Christ .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	2	Ye know that ye were Gentiles , carried away unto these dumb idols , even as ye were led .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	3	Wherefore I give you to understand , that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed : and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord , but by the Holy Ghost .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	4	Now there are diversities of gifts , but the same Spirit .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	5	And there are differences of administrations , but the same Lord .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	6	And there are diversities of operations , but it is the same God which worketh all in all .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	7	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	8	For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom ; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit ;
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	9	To another faith by the same Spirit ; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit ;
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	10	To another the working of miracles ; to another prophecy ; to another discerning of spirits ; to another divers kinds of tongues ; to another the interpretation of tongues :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	11	But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit , dividing to every man severally as he will .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	13	For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body , whether we be Jews or Gentiles , whether we be bond or free ; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	14	For the body is not one member , but many .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	15	If the foot shall say , Because I am not the hand , I am not of the body ; is it therefore not of the body ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	16	And if the ear shall say , Because I am not the eye , I am not of the body ; is it therefore not of the body ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	17	If the whole body were an eye , where were the hearing ? If the whole were hearing , where were the smelling ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	18	But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body , as it hath pleased him .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	19	And if they were all one member , where were the body ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	20	But now are they many members , yet but one body .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	21	And the eye can not say unto the hand , I have no need of thee : nor again the head to the feet , I have no need of you .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	22	Nay , much more those members of the body , which seem to be more feeble , are necessary :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	23	And those members of the body , which we think to be less honourable , upon these we bestow more abundant honour ; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	24	For our comely parts have no need : but God hath tempered the body together , having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	25	That there should be no schism in the body ; but that the members should have the same care one for another .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	26	And whether one member suffer , all the members suffer with it ; or one member be honoured , all the members rejoice with it .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	27	Now ye are the body of Christ , and members in particular .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	28	And God hath set some in the church , first apostles , secondarily prophets , thirdly teachers , after that miracles , then gifts of healings , helps , governments , diversities of tongues .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	29	Are all apostles ? are all prophets ? are all teachers ? are all workers of miracles ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	12	30	Have all the gifts of healing ? do all speak with tongues ? do all interpret ?

BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	3	But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification , and exhortation , and comfort .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	4	He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself ; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	5	I would that ye all spake with tongues , but rather that ye prophesied : for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues , except he interpret , that the church may receive edifying .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	6	Now , brethren , if I come unto you speaking with tongues , what shall I profit you , except I shall speak to you either by revelation , or by knowledge , or by prophesying , or by doctrine ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	7	And even things without life giving sound , whether pipe or harp , except they give a distinction in the sounds , how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound , who shall prepare himself to the battle ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	9	So likewise ye , except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye shall speak into the air .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	10	There are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and none of them is without signification .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	11	Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice , I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian , and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	12	Even so ye , forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts , seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	13	Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	15	What is it then ? I will pray with the Spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also : I will sing with the Spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	16	Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit , how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks , seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	17	For thou verily givest thanks well , but the other is not edified .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	18	I thank my God , I speak with tongues more than ye all :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	19	Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding , that by my voice I might teach others also , than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	20	Brethren , be not children in understanding : howbeit in malice be ye children , but in understanding be men .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	21	In the law it is written , With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people ; and yet for all that will they not hear me , saith the Lord . ( A )
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign , not to them that believe , but to them that believe not : but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not , but for them which believe .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	23	If therefore the whole church be come together into one place , and all speak with tongues , and there come in those that are unlearned , or unbelievers , will they not say that ye are mad ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	24	But if all prophesy , and there come in one that believeth not , or one unlearned , he is convinced of all , he is judged of all :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	25	And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest ; and so falling down on his face he will worship God , and report that God is in you of a truth .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	26	How is it then , brethren ? when ye come together , every one of you hath a psalm , hath a doctrine , hath a tongue , hath a revelation , hath an interpretation . Let all things be done unto edifying .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	27	If any man speak in an unknown tongue , let it be by two , or at the most by three , and that by course ; and let one interpret .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	28	But if there be no interpreter , let him keep silence in the church ; and let him speak to himself , and to God .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	29	Let the prophets speak two or three , and let the other judge .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	30	If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by , let the first hold his peace .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	31	For ye may all prophesy one by one , that all may learn , and all may be comforted .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	32	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	33	For God is not the author of confusion , but of peace , as in all churches of the saints .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	14	34	Let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also saith the law .

BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	15	Yea , and we are found false witnesses of God ; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ : whom he raised not up , if so be that the dead rise not .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	2	By which also ye are saved , if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you , unless ye have believed in vain .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	3	For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received , how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures ;
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	4	And that he was buried , and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	5	And that he was seen of Cephas , then of the twelve :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	6	After that , he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once ; of whom the greater part remain unto this present , but some are fallen asleep .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	7	After that , he was seen of James ; then of all the apostles .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	8	And last of all he was seen of me also , as of one born out of due time .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	9	For I am the least of the apostles , that am not meet to be called an apostle , because I persecuted the church of God .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	10	But by the grace of God I am what I am : and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain ; but I laboured more abundantly than they all : yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	11	Therefore whether it were I or they , so we preach , and so ye believed .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	12	Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead , how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	13	But if there be no resurrection of the dead , then is Christ not risen :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	14	And if Christ be not risen , then is our preaching vain , and your faith is also vain .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	16	For if the dead rise not , then is not Christ raised :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	17	And if Christ be not raised , your faith is vain ; ye are yet in your sins .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	18	Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ , we are of all men most miserable .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	20	But now is Christ risen from the dead , and become the firstfruits of them that slept .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	21	For since by man came death , by man came also the resurrection of the dead .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	22	For as in Adam all die , even so in Christ shall all be made alive .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	23	But every man in his own order : Christ the firstfruits ; afterward they that are Christ ’ s at his coming .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	24	Then cometh the end , when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God , even the Father ; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	25	For he must reign , till he hath put all enemies under his feet .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	26	The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	27	For he hath put all things under his feet . But when he saith all things are put under him , it is manifest that he is excepted , which did put all things under him .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him , then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him , that God may be all in all .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	29	Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead , if the dead rise not at all ? why are they then baptized for the dead ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	30	And why stand we in jeopardy every hour ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	31	I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord , I die daily .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	32	If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus , what advantageth it me , if the dead rise not ? let us eat and drink ; for to morrow we die .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	33	Be not deceived : evil communications corrupt good manners .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	34	Awake to righteousness , and sin not ; for some have not the knowledge of God : I speak this to your shame .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	35	But some man will say , How are the dead raised up ? and with what body do they come ?
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	36	Thou fool , that which thou sowest is not quickened , except it die :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	37	And that which thou sowest , thou sowest not that body that shall be , but bare grain , it may chance of wheat , or of some other grain :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	38	But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him , and to every seed his own body .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	39	All flesh is not the same flesh : but there is one kind of flesh of men , another flesh of beasts , another of fishes , and another of birds .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	40	There are also celestial bodies , and bodies terrestrial : but the glory of the celestial is one , and the glory of the terrestrial is another .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	41	There is one glory of the sun , and another glory of the moon , and another glory of the stars : for one star differeth from another star in glory .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	42	So also is the resurrection of the dead . It is sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	43	It is sown in dishonour ; it is raised in glory : it is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power :
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	44	It is sown a natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body . There is a natural body , and there is a spiritual body .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	45	And so it is written , The first man Adam was made a living soul ; the last Adam was made a quickening Spirit .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	46	Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual , but that which is natural ; and afterward that which is spiritual .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	47	The first man is of the earth , earthy : the second man is the Lord from heaven .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	48	As is the earthy , such are they also that are earthy : and as is the heavenly , such are they also that are heavenly .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	49	And as we have borne the image of the earthy , we shall also bear the image of the heavenly .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	50	Now this I say , brethren , that flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God ; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	51	Behold , I shew you a mystery ; We shall not all sleep , but we shall all be changed ,
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	52	In a moment , in the twinkling of an eye , at the last trump : for the trumpet shall sound , and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and we shall be changed .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption , and this mortal must put on immortality .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	54	So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption , and this mortal shall have put on immortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written , Death is swallowed up in victory .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	55	O death , where is thy sting ? O grave , where is thy victory ? ( A )
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	56	The sting of death is sin ; and the strength of sin is the law .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	57	But thanks be to God , which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	15	58	Therefore , my beloved brethren , be ye stedfast , unmoveable , always abounding in the work of the Lord , forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	2	Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store , as God hath prospered him , that there be no gatherings when I come .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	3	And when I come , whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters , them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	4	And if it be meet that I go also , they shall go with me .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	5	Now I will come unto you , when I shall pass through Macedonia : for I do pass through Macedonia .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	6	And it may be that I will abide , yea , and winter with you , that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	7	For I will not see you now by the way ; but I trust to tarry a while with you , if the Lord permit .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	8	But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	9	For a great door and effectual is opened unto me , and there are many adversaries .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	10	Now if Timotheus come , see that he may be with you without fear : for he worketh the work of the Lord , as I also do .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	11	Let no man therefore despise him : but conduct him forth in peace , that he may come unto me : for I look for him with the brethren .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	12	As touching our brother Apollos , I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have convenient time .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	13	Watch ye , stand fast in the faith , quit you like men , be strong .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	14	Let all your things be done with charity .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	15	I beseech you , brethren , ( ye know the house of Stephanas , that it is the firstfruits of Achaia , and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints , )
BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	17	I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus : for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	18	For they have refreshed my spirit and your ’ s : therefore acknowledge ye them that are such .
BRG	1%20Corinthians	16	19	The churches of Asia salute you . Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord , with the church that is in their house .

BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	2	Grace be to you and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , unto the church of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints which are in all Achaia :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	3	Blessed be God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies , and the God of all comfort ;
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	4	Who comforteth us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us , so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	6	And whether we be afflicted , it is for your consolation and salvation , which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer : or whether we be comforted , it is for your consolation and salvation .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	7	And our hope of you is stedfast , knowing , that as ye are partakers of the sufferings , so shall ye be also of the consolation .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	8	For we would not , brethren , have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia , that we were pressed out of measure , above strength , insomuch that we despaired even of life :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	9	But we had the sentence of death in ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God which raiseth the dead :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	10	Who delivered us from so great a death , and doth deliver : in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us ;
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	11	Ye also helping together by prayer for us , that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	12	For our rejoicing is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity and godly sincerity , not with fleshly wisdom , but by the grace of God , we have had our conversation in the world , and more abundantly to you-ward .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	13	For we write none other things unto you , than what ye read or acknowledge ; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end ;
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	14	As also ye have acknowledged us in part , that we are your rejoicing , even as ye also are our ’ s in the day of the Lord Jesus .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	15	And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before , that ye might have a second benefit ;
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	16	And to pass by you into Macedonia , and to come again out of Macedonia unto you , and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	17	When I therefore was thus minded , did I use lightness ? or the things that I purpose , do I purpose according to the flesh , that with me there should be yea yea , and nay nay ?
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	18	But as God is true , our word toward you was not yea and nay .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	19	For the Son of God , Jesus Christ , who was preached among you by us , even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus , was not yea and nay , but in him was yea .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	20	For all the promises of God in him are yea , and in him Amen , unto the glory of God by us .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	21	Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ , and hath anointed us , is God ;
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	22	Who hath also sealed us , and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	23	Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul , that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	1	24	Not for that we have dominion over your faith , but are helpers of your joy : for by faith ye stand . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	2%20Corinthians	2	2	For if I make you sorry , who is he then that maketh me glad , but the same which is made sorry by me ?
BRG	2%20Corinthians	2	3	And I wrote this same unto you , lest , when I came , I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice ; having confidence in you all , that my joy is the joy of you all .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	2	4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears ; not that ye should be grieved , but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	2	5	But if any have caused grief , he hath not grieved me , but in part : that I may not overcharge you all .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	2	6	Sufficient to such a man is this punishment , which was inflicted of many .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	2	7	So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him , and comfort him , lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	2	8	Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	2	9	For to this end also did I write , that I might know the proof of you , whether ye be obedient in all things .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	2	10	To whom ye forgive any thing , I forgive also : for if I forgave any thing , to whom I forgave it , for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ ;
BRG	2%20Corinthians	2	11	Lest Satan should get an advantage of us : for we are not ignorant of his devices .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	2	12	Furthermore , when I came to Troas to preach Christ ’ s gospel , and a door was opened unto me of the Lord ,
BRG	2%20Corinthians	2	13	I had no rest in my spirit , because I found not Titus my brother : but taking my leave of them , I went from thence into Macedonia .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	2	14	Now thanks be unto God , which always causeth us to triumph in Christ , and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	2	15	For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ , in them that are saved , and in them that perish :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	2	16	To the one we are the savour of death unto death ; and to the other the savour of life unto life . And who is sufficient for these things ?
BRG	2%20Corinthians	2	17	For we are not as many , which corrupt the word of God : but as of sincerity , but as of God , in the sight of God speak we in Christ . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	2	Ye are our epistle written in our hearts , known and read of all men :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	3	Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fleshy tables of the heart .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	4	And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	5	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves ; but our sufficiency is of God ;
BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	6	Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament ; not of the letter , but of the Spirit : for the letter killeth , but the Spirit giveth life .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	7	But if the ministration of death , written and engraven in stones , was glorious , so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance ; which glory was to be done away :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	8	How shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious ?
BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	9	For if the ministration of condemnation be glory , much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	10	For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect , by reason of the glory that excelleth .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	11	For if that which is done away was glorious , much more that which remaineth is glorious .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	12	Seeing then that we have such hope , we use great plainness of speech :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	13	And not as Moses , which put a vail over his face , that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	14	But their minds were blinded : for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament ; which vail is done away in Christ .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	15	But even unto this day , when Moses is read , the vail is upon their heart .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	16	Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord , the vail shall be taken away .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	17	Now the Lord is that Spirit : and where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is liberty .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	3	18	But we all , with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord , are changed into the same image from glory to glory , even as by the Spirit of the Lord . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	2%20Corinthians	4	6	For God , who commanded the light to shine out of darkness , hath shined in our hearts , to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	4	7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the excellency of the power may be of God , and not of us .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	4	8	We are troubled on every side , yet not distressed ; we are perplexed , but not in despair ;

BRG	2%20Corinthians	5	3	If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	5	4	For we that are in this tabernacle do groan , being burdened : not for that we would be unclothed , but clothed upon , that mortality might be swallowed up of life .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	5	6	Therefore we are always confident , knowing that , while we are at home in the body , we are absent from the Lord :

BRG	2%20Corinthians	7	2	Receive us ; we have wronged no man , we have corrupted no man , we have defrauded no man .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	7	7	And not by his coming only , but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you , when he told us your earnest desire , your mourning , your fervent mind toward me ; so that I rejoiced the more .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	7	3	I speak not this to condemn you : for I have said before , that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	7	4	Great is my boldness of speech toward you , great is my glorying of you : I am filled with comfort , I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	7	5	For , when we were come into Macedonia , our flesh had no rest , but we were troubled on every side ; without were fightings , within were fears .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	7	6	Nevertheless God , that comforteth those that are cast down , comforted us by the coming of Titus ;
BRG	2%20Corinthians	7	8	For though I made you sorry with a letter , I do not repent , though I did repent : for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry , though it were but for a season .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	7	9	Now I rejoice , not that ye were made sorry , but that ye sorrowed to repentance : for ye were made sorry after a godly manner , that ye might receive damage by us in nothing .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	7	10	For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of : but the sorrow of the world worketh death .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	7	11	For behold this selfsame thing , that ye sorrowed after a godly sort , what carefulness it wrought in you , yea , what clearing of yourselves , yea , what indignation , yea , what fear , yea , what vehement desire , yea , what zeal , yea , what revenge ! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	7	12	Wherefore , though I wrote unto you , I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong , nor for his cause that suffered wrong , but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	7	13	Therefore we were comforted in your comfort : yea , and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus , because his spirit was refreshed by you all .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	7	14	For if I have boasted any thing to him of you , I am not ashamed ; but as we spake all things to you in truth , even so our boasting , which I made before Titus , is found a truth .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	7	15	And his inward affection is more abundant toward you , whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all , how with fear and trembling ye received him .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	7	16	I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	2	How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	8	I speak not by commandment , but by occasion of the forwardness of others , and to prove the sincerity of your love .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	3	For to their power , I bear record , yea , and beyond their power they were willing of themselves ;
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	4	Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift , and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	5	And this they did , not as we hoped , but first gave their own selves to the Lord , and unto us by the will of God .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	6	Insomuch that we desired Titus , that as he had begun , so he would also finish in you the same grace also .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	7	Therefore , as ye abound in every thing , in faith , and utterance , and knowledge , and in all diligence , and in your love to us , see that ye abound in this grace also .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that ye through his poverty might be rich .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	10	And herein I give my advice : for this is expedient for you , who have begun before , not only to do , but also to be forward a year ago .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	11	Now therefore perform the doing of it ; that as there was a readiness to will , so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	12	For if there be first a willing mind , it is accepted according to that a man hath , and not according to that he hath not .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	13	For I mean not that other men be eased , and ye burdened :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	14	But by an equality , that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want , that their abundance also may be a supply for your want : that there may be equality :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	15	As it is written , He that had gathered much had nothing over ; and he that had gathered little had no lack .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	16	But thanks be to God , which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	17	For indeed he accepted the exhortation ; but being more forward , of his own accord he went unto you .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	18	And we have sent with him the brother , whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches ;
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	19	And not that only , but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace , which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord , and declaration of your ready mind :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	20	Avoiding this , that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	21	Providing for honest things , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	22	And we have sent with them our brother , whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things , but now much more diligent , upon the great confidence which I have in you .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	23	Whether any do enquire of Titus , he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you : or our brethren be enquired of , they are the messengers of the churches , and the glory of Christ .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	8	24	Wherefore shew ye to them , and before the churches , the proof of your love , and of our boasting on your behalf . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	2%20Corinthians	9	2	For I know the forwardness of your mind , for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia , that Achaia was ready a year ago ; and your zeal hath provoked very many .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	9	9	( As it is written , He hath dispersed abroad ; he hath given to the poor : his righteousness remaineth for ever .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	9	3	Yet have I sent the brethren , lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf ; that , as I said , ye may be ready :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	9	4	Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me , and find you unprepared , we ( that we say not , ye ) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	9	5	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren , that they would go before unto you , and make up beforehand your bounty , whereof ye had notice before , that the same might be ready , as a matter of bounty , and not as of covetousness .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	9	6	But this I say , He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly ; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	9	7	Every man according as he purposeth in his heart , so let him give ; not grudgingly , or of necessity : for God loveth a cheerful giver .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	9	8	And God is able to make all grace abound toward you ; that ye , always having all sufficiency in all things , may abound to every good work :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	9	10	Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food , and multiply your seed sown , and increase the fruits of your righteousness ; )
BRG	2%20Corinthians	9	11	Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness , which causeth through us thanksgiving to God .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	9	12	For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints , but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God ;
BRG	2%20Corinthians	9	13	Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ , and for your liberal distribution unto them , and unto all men ;
BRG	2%20Corinthians	9	14	And by their prayer for you , which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you .

BRG	2%20Corinthians	10	2	But I beseech you , that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence , wherewith I think to be bold against some , which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	10	10	For his letters , say they , are weighty and powerful ; but his bodily presence is weak , and his speech contemptible .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	10	3	For though we walk in the flesh , we do not war after the flesh :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	10	4	( For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal , but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds ; )
BRG	2%20Corinthians	10	5	Casting down imaginations , and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God , and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ ;
BRG	2%20Corinthians	10	6	And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience , when your obedience is fulfilled .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	10	7	Do ye look on things after the outward appearance ? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ ’ s , let him of himself think this again , that , as he is Christ ’ s , even so are we Christ ’ s .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	10	8	For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority , which the Lord hath given us for edification , and not for your destruction , I should not be ashamed :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	10	9	That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	10	11	Let such an one think this , that , such as we are in word by letters when we are absent , such will we be also in deed when we are present .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	10	12	For we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	10	13	But we will not boast of things without our measure , but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us , a measure to reach even unto you .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	10	14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure , as though we reached not unto you : for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ :
BRG	2%20Corinthians	10	15	Not boasting of things without our measure , that is , of other men ’ s labours ; but having hope , when your faith is increased , that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly ,
BRG	2%20Corinthians	10	16	To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you , and not to boast in another man ’ s line of things made ready to our hand .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	10	17	But he that glorieth , let him glory in the Lord .

BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	2	For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy : for I have espoused you to one husband , that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	11	Wherefore ? because I love you not ? God knoweth .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	3	But I fear , lest by any means , as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty , so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	4	For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus , whom we have not preached , or if ye receive another spirit , which ye have not received , or another gospel , which ye have not accepted , ye might well bear with him .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	5	For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	6	But though I be rude in speech , yet not in knowledge ; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	7	Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted , because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely ?
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	8	I robbed other churches , taking wages of them , to do you service .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	9	And when I was present with you , and wanted , I was chargeable to no man : for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied : and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you , and so will I keep myself .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	10	As the truth of Christ is in me , no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	12	But what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion ; that wherein they glory , they may be found even as we .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	13	For such are false apostles , deceitful workers , transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	14	And no marvel ; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	15	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness ; whose end shall be according to their works .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	16	I say again , Let no man think me a fool ; if otherwise , yet as a fool receive me , that I may boast myself a little .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	17	That which I speak , I speak it not after the Lord , but as it were foolishly , in this confidence of boasting .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	18	Seeing that many glory after the flesh , I will glory also .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	19	For ye suffer fools gladly , seeing ye yourselves are wise .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	20	For ye suffer , if a man bring you into bondage , if a man devour you , if a man take of you , if a man exalt himself , if a man smite you on the face .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	21	I speak as concerning reproach , as though we had been weak . Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold , ( I speak foolishly , ) I am bold also .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	22	Are they Hebrews ? so am I . Are they Israelites ? so am I . Are they the seed of Abraham ? so am I .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	23	Are they ministers of Christ ? ( I speak as a fool ) I am more ; in labours more abundant , in stripes above measure , in prisons more frequent , in deaths oft .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	24	Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	25	Thrice was I beaten with rods , once was I stoned , thrice I suffered shipwreck , a night and a day I have been in the deep ;
BRG	2%20Corinthians	11	26	In journeyings often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils by mine own countrymen , in perils by the heathen , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brethren ;

BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	2	I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago , ( whether in the body , I can not tell ; or whether out of the body , I can not tell : God knoweth ; ) such an one caught up to the third heaven .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	12	Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience , in signs , and wonders , and mighty deeds .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	3	And I knew such a man , ( whether in the body , or out of the body , I can not tell : God knoweth ; )
BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	4	How that he was caught up into paradise , and heard unspeakable words , which it is not lawful for a man to utter .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	5	Of such an one will I glory : yet of myself I will not glory , but in mine infirmities .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	6	For though I would desire to glory , I shall not be a fool ; for I will say the truth : but now I forbear , lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be , or that he heareth of me .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	7	And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations , there was given to me a thorn in the flesh , the messenger of Satan to buffet me , lest I should be exalted above measure .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	8	For this thing I besought the Lord thrice , that it might depart from me .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	9	And he said unto me , My grace is sufficient for thee : for my strength is made perfect in weakness . Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities , that the power of Christ may rest upon me .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	10	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities , in reproaches , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses for Christ ’ s sake : for when I am weak , then am I strong .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	11	I am become a fool in glorying ; ye have compelled me : for I ought to have been commended of you : for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles , though I be nothing .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	13	For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches , except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you ? forgive me this wrong .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	14	Behold , the third time I am ready to come to you ; and I will not be burdensome to you : for I seek not your ’ s , but you : for the children ought not to lay up for the parents , but the parents for the children .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	15	And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you ; though the more abundantly I love you , the less I be loved .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	16	But be it so , I did not burden you : nevertheless , being crafty , I caught you with guile .
BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	17	Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you ?
BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	18	I desired Titus , and with him I sent a brother . Did Titus make a gain of you ? walked we not in the same Spirit ? walked we not in the same steps ?

BRG	2%20Corinthians	12	21	And lest , when I come again , my God will humble me among you , and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already , and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Galatians	1	3	Grace be to you and peace from God the Father , and from our Lord Jesus Christ ,

BRG	Galatians	1	11	But I certify you , brethren , that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man .
BRG	Galatians	1	12	For I neither received it of man , neither was I taught it , but by the revelation of Jesus Christ .
BRG	Galatians	1	13	For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews ’ religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God , and wasted it :
BRG	Galatians	1	14	And profited in the Jews ’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation , being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers .

BRG	Galatians	1	16	To reveal his Son in me , that I might preach him among the heathen ; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood :

BRG	Galatians	2	8	( For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision , the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles : )
BRG	Galatians	2	9	And when James , Cephas , and John , who seemed to be pillars , perceived the grace that was given unto me , they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship ; that we should go unto the heathen , and they unto the circumcision .
BRG	Galatians	2	10	Only they would that we should remember the poor ; the same which I also was forward to do .
BRG	Galatians	2	11	But when Peter was come to Antioch , I withstood him to the face , because he was to be blamed .
BRG	Galatians	2	12	For before that certain came from James , he did eat with the Gentiles : but when they were come , he withdrew and separated himself , fearing them which were of the circumcision .
BRG	Galatians	2	13	And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him ; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation .
BRG	Galatians	2	14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel , I said unto Peter before them all , If thou , being a Jew , livest after the manner of Gentiles , and not as do the Jews , why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews ?
BRG	Galatians	2	15	We who are Jews by nature , and not sinners of the Gentiles ,
BRG	Galatians	2	16	Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law , but by the faith of Jesus Christ , even we have believed in Jesus Christ , that we might be justified by the faith of Christ , and not by the works of the law : for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified .
BRG	Galatians	2	17	But if , while we seek to be justified by Christ , we ourselves also are found sinners , is therefore Christ the minister of sin ? God forbid .
BRG	Galatians	2	18	For if I build again the things which I destroyed , I make myself a transgressor .
BRG	Galatians	2	19	For I through the law am dead to the law , that I might live unto God .
BRG	Galatians	2	20	I am crucified with Christ : nevertheless I live ; yet not I , but Christ liveth in me : and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God , who loved me , and gave himself for me .
BRG	Galatians	2	21	I do not frustrate the grace of God : for if righteousness come by the law , then Christ is dead in vain . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Galatians	3	3	Are ye so foolish ? having begun in the Spirit , are ye now made perfect by the flesh ?
BRG	Galatians	3	2	This only would I learn of you , Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
BRG	Galatians	3	4	Have ye suffered so many things in vain ? if it be yet in vain .
BRG	Galatians	3	5	He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit , and worketh miracles among you , doeth he it by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
BRG	Galatians	3	6	Even as Abraham believed God , and it was accounted to him for righteousness .
BRG	Galatians	3	7	Know ye therefore that they which are of faith , the same are the children of Abraham .
BRG	Galatians	3	8	And the scripture , foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith , preached before the gospel unto Abraham , saying , In thee shall all nations be blessed . ( A )
BRG	Galatians	3	9	So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham .
BRG	Galatians	3	10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse : for it is written , Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them .
BRG	Galatians	3	11	But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God , it is evident : for , The just shall live by faith . ( B )
BRG	Galatians	3	12	And the law is not of faith : but , The man that doeth them shall live in them .
BRG	Galatians	3	13	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law , being made a curse for us : for it is written , Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree :
BRG	Galatians	3	14	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith .
BRG	Galatians	3	15	Brethren , I speak after the manner of men ; Though it be but a man ’ s covenant , yet if it be confirmed , no man disannulleth , or addeth thereto .
BRG	Galatians	3	16	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made . He saith not , And to seeds , as of many ; but as of one , And to thy seed , which is Christ . ( C )
BRG	Galatians	3	17	And this I say , that the covenant , that was confirmed before of God in Christ , the law , which was four hundred and thirty years after , can not disannul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
BRG	Galatians	3	18	For if the inheritance be of the law , it is no more of promise : but God gave it to Abraham by promise .
BRG	Galatians	3	19	Wherefore then serveth the law ? It was added because of transgressions , till the seed should come to whom the promise was made ; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator .
BRG	Galatians	3	20	Now a mediator is not a mediator of one , but God is one .
BRG	Galatians	3	21	Is the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law .
BRG	Galatians	3	22	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin , that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe .
BRG	Galatians	3	23	But before faith came , we were kept under the law , shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed .
BRG	Galatians	3	24	Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
BRG	Galatians	3	25	But after that faith is come , we are no longer under a schoolmaster .
BRG	Galatians	3	26	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus .
BRG	Galatians	3	27	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ .
BRG	Galatians	3	28	There is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither bond nor free , there is neither male nor female : for ye are all one in Christ Jesus .
BRG	Galatians	3	29	And if ye be Christ ’ s , then are ye Abraham ’ s seed , and heirs according to the promise . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Galatians	4	4	But when the fulness of the time was come , God sent forth his Son , made of a woman , made under the law ,
BRG	Galatians	4	2	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father .
BRG	Galatians	4	3	Even so we , when we were children , were in bondage under the elements of the world :
BRG	Galatians	4	5	To redeem them that were under the law , that we might receive the adoption of sons .
BRG	Galatians	4	6	And because ye are sons , God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts , crying , Abba , Father .

BRG	Galatians	4	8	Howbeit then , when ye knew not God , ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods .
BRG	Galatians	4	9	But now , after that ye have known God , or rather are known of God , how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements , whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage ?
BRG	Galatians	4	10	Ye observe days , and months , and times , and years .
BRG	Galatians	4	11	I am afraid of you , lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain .
BRG	Galatians	4	12	Brethren , I beseech you , be as I am ; for I am as ye are : ye have not injured me at all .
BRG	Galatians	4	13	Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first .
BRG	Galatians	4	14	And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not , nor rejected ; but received me as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus .
BRG	Galatians	4	15	Where is then the blessedness ye spake of ? for I bear you record , that , if it had been possible , ye would have plucked out your own eyes , and have given them to me .
BRG	Galatians	4	16	Am I therefore become your enemy , because I tell you the truth ?
BRG	Galatians	4	17	They zealously affect you , but not well ; yea , they would exclude you , that ye might affect them .
BRG	Galatians	4	18	But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing , and not only when I am present with you .
BRG	Galatians	4	19	My little children , of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you ,
BRG	Galatians	4	20	I desire to be present with you now , and to change my voice ; for I stand in doubt of you .
BRG	Galatians	4	21	Tell me , ye that desire to be under the law , do ye not hear the law ?
BRG	Galatians	4	22	For it is written , that Abraham had two sons , the one by a bondmaid , the other by a freewoman .
BRG	Galatians	4	23	But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh ; but he of the freewoman was by promise .
BRG	Galatians	4	24	Which things are an allegory : for these are the two covenants ; the one from the mount Sinai , which gendereth to bondage , which is Agar .
BRG	Galatians	4	25	For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia , and answereth to Jerusalem which now is , and is in bondage with her children .
BRG	Galatians	4	26	But Jerusalem which is above is free , which is the mother of us all .
BRG	Galatians	4	27	For it is written , Rejoice , thou barren that bearest not ; break forth and cry , thou that travailest not : for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband . ( A )
BRG	Galatians	4	28	Now we , brethren , as Isaac was , are the children of promise .
BRG	Galatians	4	29	But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit , even so it is now .
BRG	Galatians	4	30	Nevertheless what saith the scripture ? Cast out the bondwoman and her son : for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman .
BRG	Galatians	4	31	So then , brethren , we are not children of the bondwoman , but of the free . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Galatians	5	16	This I say then , Walk in the Spirit , and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh .
BRG	Galatians	5	17	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh : and these are contrary the one to the other : so that ye can not do the things that ye would .

BRG	Galatians	5	21	Envyings , murders , drunkenness , revellings , and such like : of the which I tell you before , as I have also told you in time past , that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God .
BRG	Galatians	5	22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love , joy , peace , longsuffering , gentleness , goodness , faith ,
BRG	Galatians	5	23	Meekness , temperance : against such there is no law .

BRG	Ephesians	5	5	For this ye know , that no whoremonger , nor unclean person , nor covetous man , who is an idolater , hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
BRG	Ephesians	5	2	And walk in love , as Christ also hath loved us , and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour .
BRG	Ephesians	5	3	But fornication , and all uncleanness , or covetousness , let it not be once named among you , as becometh saints ;
BRG	Ephesians	5	4	Neither filthiness , nor foolish talking , nor jesting , which are not convenient : but rather giving of thanks .
BRG	Ephesians	5	6	Let no man deceive you with vain words : for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience .
BRG	Ephesians	5	7	Be not ye therefore partakers with them .
BRG	Ephesians	5	8	For ye were sometimes darkness , but now are ye light in the Lord : walk as children of light :
BRG	Ephesians	5	9	( For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth ; )
BRG	Ephesians	5	10	Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord .
BRG	Ephesians	5	11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove them .
BRG	Ephesians	5	12	For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret .
BRG	Ephesians	5	13	But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light : for whatsoever doth make manifest is light .
BRG	Ephesians	5	14	Wherefore he saith , Awake thou that sleepest , and arise from the dead , and Christ shall give thee light .
BRG	Ephesians	5	15	See then that ye walk circumspectly , not as fools , but as wise ,
BRG	Ephesians	5	16	Redeeming the time , because the days are evil .
BRG	Ephesians	5	17	Wherefore be ye not unwise , but understanding what the will of the Lord is .
BRG	Ephesians	5	18	And be not drunk with wine , wherein is excess ; but be filled with the Spirit ;
BRG	Ephesians	5	19	Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
BRG	Ephesians	5	20	Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
BRG	Ephesians	5	21	Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God .
BRG	Ephesians	5	22	Wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as unto the Lord .
BRG	Ephesians	5	23	For the husband is the head of the wife , even as Christ is the head of the church : and he is the saviour of the body .
BRG	Ephesians	5	24	Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ , so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing .
BRG	Ephesians	5	25	Husbands , love your wives , even as Christ also loved the church , and gave himself for it ;
BRG	Ephesians	5	26	That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word ,
BRG	Ephesians	5	27	That he might present it to himself a glorious church , not having spot , or wrinkle , or any such thing ; but that it should be holy and without blemish .
BRG	Ephesians	5	28	So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies . He that loveth his wife loveth himself .
BRG	Ephesians	5	29	For no man ever yet hated his own flesh ; but nourisheth and cherisheth it , even as the Lord the church :
BRG	Ephesians	5	30	For we are members of his body , of his flesh , and of his bones .
BRG	Ephesians	5	31	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall be joined unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh .
BRG	Ephesians	5	32	This is a great mystery : but I speak concerning Christ and the church .
BRG	Ephesians	5	33	Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself ; and the wife see that she reverence her husband . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Philippians	1	2	Grace be unto you , and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
BRG	Philippians	1	3	I thank my God upon every remembrance of you ,
BRG	Philippians	1	4	Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy ,
BRG	Philippians	1	5	For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now ;
BRG	Philippians	1	6	Being confident of this very thing , that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ :
BRG	Philippians	1	7	Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all , because I have you in my heart ; inasmuch as both in my bonds , and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel , ye all are partakers of my grace .
BRG	Philippians	1	8	For God is my record , how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ .
BRG	Philippians	1	9	And this I pray , that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment ;
BRG	Philippians	1	10	That ye may approve things that are excellent ; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ ;
BRG	Philippians	1	11	Being filled with the fruits of righteousness , which are by Jesus Christ , unto the glory and praise of God .
BRG	Philippians	1	12	But I would ye should understand , brethren , that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel ;
BRG	Philippians	1	13	So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace , and in all other places ;
BRG	Philippians	1	14	And many of the brethren in the Lord , waxing confident by my bonds , are much more bold to speak the word without fear .
BRG	Philippians	1	15	Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife ; and some also of good will :
BRG	Philippians	1	16	The one preach Christ of contention , not sincerely , supposing to add affliction to my bonds :
BRG	Philippians	1	17	But the other of love , knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel .
BRG	Philippians	1	18	What then ? notwithstanding , every way , whether in pretence , or in truth , Christ is preached ; and I therein do rejoice , yea , and will rejoice .
BRG	Philippians	1	19	For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer , and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
BRG	Philippians	1	20	According to my earnest expectation and my hope , that in nothing I shall be ashamed , but that with all boldness , as always , so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body , whether it be by life , or by death .
BRG	Philippians	1	21	For to me to live is Christ , and to die is gain .
BRG	Philippians	1	22	But if I live in the flesh , this is the fruit of my labour : yet what I shall choose I wot not .
BRG	Philippians	1	23	For I am in a strait betwixt two , having a desire to depart , and to be with Christ ; which is far better :
BRG	Philippians	1	24	Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you .
BRG	Philippians	1	25	And having this confidence , I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith ;
BRG	Philippians	1	26	That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again .
BRG	Philippians	1	27	Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ : that whether I come and see you , or else be absent , I may hear of your affairs , that ye stand fast in one Spirit , with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel ;
BRG	Philippians	1	28	And in nothing terrified by your adversaries : which is to them an evident token of perdition , but to you of salvation , and that of God .
BRG	Philippians	1	29	For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ , not only to believe on him , but also to suffer for his sake ;
BRG	Philippians	1	30	Having the same conflict which ye saw in me , and now hear to be in me . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Philippians	2	3	Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory ; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves .
BRG	Philippians	2	4	Look not every man on his own things , but every man also on the things of others .
BRG	Philippians	2	5	Let this mind be in you , which was also in Christ Jesus :
BRG	Philippians	2	6	Who , being in the form of God , thought it not robbery to be equal with God :
BRG	Philippians	2	7	But made himself of no reputation , and took upon him the form of a servant , and was made in the likeness of men :
BRG	Philippians	2	8	And being found in fashion as a man , he humbled himself , and became obedient unto death , even the death of the cross .
BRG	Philippians	2	9	Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him , and given him a name which is above every name :
BRG	Philippians	2	10	That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of things in heaven , and things in earth , and things under the earth ;
BRG	Philippians	2	11	And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
BRG	Philippians	2	12	Wherefore , my beloved , as ye have always obeyed , not as in my presence only , but now much more in my absence , work out your own salvation with fear and trembling .
BRG	Philippians	2	13	For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure .
BRG	Philippians	2	14	Do all things without murmurings and disputings :
BRG	Philippians	2	15	That ye may be blameless and harmless , the sons of God , without rebuke , in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation , among whom ye shine as lights in the world ;
BRG	Philippians	2	16	Holding forth the word of life ; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ , that I have not run in vain , neither laboured in vain .
BRG	Philippians	2	17	Yea , and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith , I joy , and rejoice with you all .
BRG	Philippians	2	18	For the same cause also do ye joy , and rejoice with me .
BRG	Philippians	2	19	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you , that I also may be of good comfort , when I know your state .
BRG	Philippians	2	20	For I have no man likeminded , who will naturally care for your state .
BRG	Philippians	2	21	For all seek their own , not the things which are Jesus Christ ’ s .
BRG	Philippians	2	22	But ye know the proof of him , that , as a son with the father , he hath served with me in the gospel .
BRG	Philippians	2	23	Him therefore I hope to send presently , so soon as I shall see how it will go with me .
BRG	Philippians	2	24	But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly .
BRG	Philippians	2	25	Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus , my brother , and companion in labour , and fellowsoldier , but your messenger , and he that ministered to my wants .
BRG	Philippians	2	26	For he longed after you all , and was full of heaviness , because that ye had heard that he had been sick .
BRG	Philippians	2	27	For indeed he was sick nigh unto death : but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
BRG	Philippians	2	28	I sent him therefore the more carefully , that , when ye see him again , ye may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
BRG	Philippians	2	29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness ; and hold such in reputation :
BRG	Philippians	2	30	Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death , not regarding his life , to supply your lack of service toward me . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Colossians	3	16	Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom ; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord .
BRG	Colossians	3	17	And whatsoever ye do in word or deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God and the Father by him .
BRG	Colossians	3	18	Wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as it is fit in the Lord .
BRG	Colossians	3	19	Husbands , love your wives , and be not bitter against them .
BRG	Colossians	3	20	Children , obey your parents in all things : for this is well pleasing unto the Lord .

BRG	1%20Thessalonians	2	2	But even after that we had suffered before , and were shamefully entreated , as ye know , at Philippi , we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention .
BRG	1%20Thessalonians	2	3	For our exhortation was not of deceit , nor of uncleanness , nor in guile :
BRG	1%20Thessalonians	2	4	But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel , even so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but God , which trieth our hearts .

BRG	1%20Timothy	1	1	Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour , and Lord Jesus Christ , which is our hope ;
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	2	Unto Timothy , my own son in the faith : Grace , mercy , and peace , from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord .
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	3	As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus , when I went into Macedonia , that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine ,
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	4	Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies , which minister questions , rather than godly edifying which is in faith : so do .
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	5	Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart , and of a good conscience , and of faith unfeigned :
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	6	From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling ;
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	7	Desiring to be teachers of the law ; understanding neither what they say , nor whereof they affirm .
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	8	But we know that the law is good , if a man use it lawfully ;
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	9	Knowing this , that the law is not made for a righteous man , but for the lawless and disobedient , for the ungodly and for sinners , for unholy and profane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for manslayers ,
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	10	For whoremongers , for them that defile themselves with mankind , for menstealers , for liars , for perjured persons , and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine ;
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	11	According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God , which was committed to my trust .
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	12	And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord , who hath enabled me , for that he counted me faithful , putting me into the ministry ;
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	13	Who was before a blasphemer , and a persecutor , and injurious : but I obtained mercy , because I did it ignorantly in unbelief .
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	14	And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	15	This is a faithful saying , and worthy of all acceptation , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom I am chief .
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	16	Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering , for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting .
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	17	Now unto the King eternal , immortal , invisible , the only wise God , be honour and glory for ever and ever . Amen .
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	18	This charge I commit unto thee , son Timothy , according to the prophecies which went before on thee , that thou by them mightest war a good warfare ;
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	19	Holding faith , and a good conscience ; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck :
BRG	1%20Timothy	1	20	Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander ; whom I have delivered unto Satan , that they may learn not to blaspheme . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Hebrews	7	19	For the law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did ; by the which we draw nigh unto God .
BRG	Hebrews	7	20	And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest :
BRG	Hebrews	7	21	( For those priests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said unto him , The Lord sware and will not repent , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec : ) ( B )
BRG	Hebrews	7	22	By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament .
BRG	Hebrews	7	23	And they truly were many priests , because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death :
BRG	Hebrews	7	24	But this man , because he continueth ever , hath an unchangeable priesthood .
BRG	Hebrews	7	25	Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them .
BRG	Hebrews	7	26	For such an high priest became us , who is holy , harmless , undefiled , separate from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ;
BRG	Hebrews	7	27	Who needeth not daily , as those high priests , to offer up sacrifice , first for his own sins , and then for the people ’ s : for this he did once , when he offered up himself .

BRG	Hebrews	8	8	For finding fault with them , he saith , Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah : ( A )
BRG	Hebrews	8	2	A minister of the sanctuary , and of the true tabernacle , which the Lord pitched , and not man .
BRG	Hebrews	8	3	For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices : wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer .
BRG	Hebrews	8	4	For if he were on earth , he should not be a priest , seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law :
BRG	Hebrews	8	5	Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things , as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle : for , See , saith he , that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount .
BRG	Hebrews	8	6	But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry , by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises .
BRG	Hebrews	8	7	For if that first covenant had been faultless , then should no place have been sought for the second .
BRG	Hebrews	8	9	Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt ; because they continued not in my covenant , and I regarded them not , saith the Lord . ( B )
BRG	Hebrews	8	10	For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , saith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hearts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people : ( C )
BRG	Hebrews	8	11	And they shall not teach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest . ( D )

BRG	Hebrews	9	9	Which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices , that could not make him that did the service perfect , as pertaining to the conscience ;
BRG	Hebrews	9	2	For there was a tabernacle made ; the first , wherein was the candlestick , and the table , and the shewbread ; which is called the sanctuary .
BRG	Hebrews	9	3	And after the second veil , the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all ;
BRG	Hebrews	9	4	Which had the golden censer , and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold , wherein was the golden pot that had manna , and Aaron ’ s rod that budded , and the tables of the covenant ;
BRG	Hebrews	9	5	And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat ; of which we can not now speak particularly .
BRG	Hebrews	9	6	Now when these things were thus ordained , the priests went always into the first tabernacle , accomplishing the service of God .
BRG	Hebrews	9	7	But into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people :
BRG	Hebrews	9	8	The Holy Ghost this signifying , that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest , while as the first tabernacle was yet standing :
BRG	Hebrews	9	10	Which stood only in meats and drinks , and divers washings , and carnal ordinances , imposed on them until the time of reformation .
BRG	Hebrews	9	11	But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this building ;
BRG	Hebrews	9	12	Neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us .
BRG	Hebrews	9	13	For if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean , sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh :
BRG	Hebrews	9	14	How much more shall the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God , purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ?
BRG	Hebrews	9	15	And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance .
BRG	Hebrews	9	16	For where a testament is , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator .
BRG	Hebrews	9	17	For a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth .
BRG	Hebrews	9	18	Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood .
BRG	Hebrews	9	19	For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people ,
BRG	Hebrews	9	20	Saying , This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you .
BRG	Hebrews	9	21	Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle , and all the vessels of the ministry .
BRG	Hebrews	9	22	And almost all things are by the law purged with blood ; and without shedding of blood is no remission .
BRG	Hebrews	9	23	It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
BRG	Hebrews	9	24	For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us :
BRG	Hebrews	9	25	Nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others ;
BRG	Hebrews	9	26	For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
BRG	Hebrews	9	27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die , but after this the judgment :
BRG	Hebrews	9	28	So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many ; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Hebrews	10	10	By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
BRG	Hebrews	10	2	For then would they not have ceased to be offered ? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins .
BRG	Hebrews	10	3	But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year .
BRG	Hebrews	10	4	For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins .
BRG	Hebrews	10	5	Wherefore when he cometh into the world , he saith , Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not , but a body hast thou prepared me :
BRG	Hebrews	10	6	In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure .
BRG	Hebrews	10	7	Then said I , Lo , I come ( in the volume of the book it is written of me , ) to do thy will , O God .
BRG	Hebrews	10	8	Above when he said , Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not , neither hadst pleasure therein ; which are offered by the law ;
BRG	Hebrews	10	9	Then said he , Lo , I come to do thy will , O God . He taketh away the first , that he may establish the second .
BRG	Hebrews	10	11	And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins :
BRG	Hebrews	10	12	But this man , after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of God ;
BRG	Hebrews	10	13	From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool .
BRG	Hebrews	10	14	For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified .
BRG	Hebrews	10	15	Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us : for after that he had said before ,
BRG	Hebrews	10	16	This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , saith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hearts , and in their minds will I write them ; ( A )
BRG	Hebrews	10	17	And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more . ( B )
BRG	Hebrews	10	18	Now where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sin .
BRG	Hebrews	10	19	Having therefore , brethren , boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus ,
BRG	Hebrews	10	20	By a new and living way , which he hath consecrated for us , through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ;
BRG	Hebrews	10	21	And having an high priest over the house of God ;
BRG	Hebrews	10	22	Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and our bodies washed with pure water .
BRG	Hebrews	10	23	Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering ; ( for he is faithful that promised ; )
BRG	Hebrews	10	24	And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works :
BRG	Hebrews	10	25	Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as the manner of some is ; but exhorting one another : and so much the more , as ye see the day approaching .
BRG	Hebrews	10	26	For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins ,
BRG	Hebrews	10	27	But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation , which shall devour the adversaries .
BRG	Hebrews	10	28	He that despised Moses ’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses :
BRG	Hebrews	10	29	Of how much sorer punishment , suppose ye , shall he be thought worthy , who hath trodden under foot the Son of God , and hath counted the blood of the covenant , wherewith he was sanctified , an unholy thing , and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace ?
BRG	Hebrews	10	30	For we know him that hath said , Vengeance belongeth unto me , I will recompense , saith the Lord . And again , The Lord shall judge his people . ( C )
BRG	Hebrews	10	31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
BRG	Hebrews	10	32	But call to remembrance the former days , in which , after ye were illuminated , ye endured a great fight of afflictions ;
BRG	Hebrews	10	33	Partly , whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions ; and partly , whilst ye became companions of them that were so used .
BRG	Hebrews	10	34	For ye had compassion of me in my bonds , and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance .
BRG	Hebrews	10	35	Cast not away therefore your confidence , which hath great recompence of reward .
BRG	Hebrews	10	36	For ye have need of patience , that , after ye have done the will of God , ye might receive the promise .
BRG	Hebrews	10	37	For yet a little while , and he that shall come will come , and will not tarry . ( D )

BRG	Hebrews	11	9	By faith he sojourned in the land of promise , as in a strange country , dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise :

BRG	Hebrews	12	4	Ye have not yet resisted unto blood , striving against sin .

BRG	James	1	16	Do not err , my beloved brethren .
BRG	James	1	17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning .
BRG	James	1	18	Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth , that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures .
BRG	James	1	19	Wherefore , my beloved brethren , let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , slow to wrath :
BRG	James	1	20	For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God .
BRG	James	1	21	Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness , and receive with meekness the engrafted word , which is able to save your souls .
BRG	James	1	22	But be ye doers of the word , and not hearers only , deceiving your own selves .
BRG	James	1	23	For if any be a hearer of the word , and not a doer , he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass :
BRG	James	1	24	For he beholdeth himself , and goeth his way , and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was .
BRG	James	1	25	But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty , and continueth therein , he being not a forgetful hearer , but a doer of the work , this man shall be blessed in his deed .
BRG	James	1	26	If any man among you seem to be religious , and bridleth not his tongue , but deceiveth his own heart , this man ’ s religion is vain .
BRG	James	1	27	Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this , To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction , and to keep himself unspotted from the world . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	James	2	2	For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring , in goodly apparel , and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment ;
BRG	James	2	3	And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing , and say unto him , Sit thou here in a good place ; and say to the poor , Stand thou there , or sit here under my footstool :
BRG	James	2	4	Are ye not then partial in yourselves , and are become judges of evil thoughts ?
BRG	James	2	5	Hearken , my beloved brethren , Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him ?
BRG	James	2	6	But ye have despised the poor . Do not rich men oppress you , and draw you before the judgment seats ?
BRG	James	2	7	Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called ?
BRG	James	2	8	If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself , ye do well : ( A )
BRG	James	2	9	But if ye have respect to persons , ye commit sin , and are convinced of the law as transgressors .
BRG	James	2	10	For whosoever shall keep the whole law , and yet offend in one point , he is guilty of all .
BRG	James	2	11	For he that said , Do not commit adultery , said also , Do not kill . Now if thou commit no adultery , yet if thou kill , thou art become a transgressor of the law . ( B )
BRG	James	2	12	So speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty .
BRG	James	2	13	For he shall have judgment without mercy , that hath shewed no mercy ; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment .
BRG	James	2	14	What doth it profit , my brethren , though a man say he hath faith , and have not works ? can faith save him ?
BRG	James	2	15	If a brother or sister be naked , and destitute of daily food ,
BRG	James	2	16	And one of you say unto them , Depart in peace , be ye warmed and filled ; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body ; what doth it profit ?
BRG	James	2	17	Even so faith , if it hath not works , is dead , being alone .
BRG	James	2	18	Yea , a man may say , Thou hast faith , and I have works : shew me thy faith without thy works , and I will shew thee my faith by my works .
BRG	James	2	19	Thou believest that there is one God ; thou doest well : the devils also believe , and tremble .
BRG	James	2	20	But wilt thou know , O vain man , that faith without works is dead ?
BRG	James	2	21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works , when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar ?
BRG	James	2	22	Seest thou how faith wrought with his works , and by works was faith made perfect ?
BRG	James	2	23	And the scripture was fulfilled which saith , Abraham believed God , and it was imputed unto him for righteousness : and he was called the Friend of God .
BRG	James	2	24	Ye see then how that by works a man is justified , and not by faith only .
BRG	James	2	25	Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works , when she had received the messengers , and had sent them out another way ?
BRG	James	2	26	For as the body without the Spirit is dead , so faith without works is dead also . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	James	3	14	But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts , glory not , and lie not against the truth .

BRG	1%20Peter	5	5	Likewise , ye younger , submit yourselves unto the elder . Yea , all of you be subject one to another , and be clothed with humility : for God resisteth the proud , and giveth grace to the humble .
BRG	1%20Peter	5	2	Feed the flock of God which is among you , taking the oversight thereof , not by constraint , but willingly ; not for filthy lucre , but of a ready mind ;
BRG	1%20Peter	5	3	Neither as being lords over God ’ s heritage , but being ensamples to the flock .
BRG	1%20Peter	5	4	And when the chief Shepherd shall appear , ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away .
BRG	1%20Peter	5	6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God , that he may exalt you in due time :
BRG	1%20Peter	5	7	Casting all your care upon him ; for he careth for you .
BRG	1%20Peter	5	8	Be sober , be vigilant ; because your adversary the devil , as a roaring lion , walketh about , seeking whom he may devour :
BRG	1%20Peter	5	9	Whom resist stedfast in the faith , knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world .
BRG	1%20Peter	5	10	But the God of all grace , who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus , after that ye have suffered a while , make you perfect , stablish , strengthen , settle you .
BRG	1%20Peter	5	11	To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .

BRG	1%20Peter	5	13	The church that is at Babylon , elected together with you , saluteth you ; and so doth Marcus my son .

BRG	2%20Peter	1	2	Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God , and of Jesus our Lord ,
BRG	2%20Peter	1	1	Simon Peter , a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ , to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ :
BRG	2%20Peter	1	3	According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness , through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue :
BRG	2%20Peter	1	4	Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises : that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature , having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust .
BRG	2%20Peter	1	5	And beside this , giving all diligence , add to your faith virtue ; and to virtue knowledge ;
BRG	2%20Peter	1	6	And to knowledge temperance ; and to temperance patience ; and to patience godliness ;
BRG	2%20Peter	1	7	And to godliness brotherly kindness ; and to brotherly kindness charity .
BRG	2%20Peter	1	8	For if these things be in you , and abound , they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
BRG	2%20Peter	1	9	But he that lacketh these things is blind , and can not see afar off , and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins .
BRG	2%20Peter	1	10	Wherefore the rather , brethren , give diligence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never fall :
BRG	2%20Peter	1	11	For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ .
BRG	2%20Peter	1	12	Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things , though ye know them , and be established in the present truth .
BRG	2%20Peter	1	13	Yea , I think it meet , as long as I am in this tabernacle , to stir you up by putting you in remembrance ;
BRG	2%20Peter	1	14	Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle , even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me .
BRG	2%20Peter	1	15	Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance .
BRG	2%20Peter	1	16	For we have not followed cunningly devised fables , when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
BRG	2%20Peter	1	17	For he received from God the Father honour and glory , when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . ( A )
BRG	2%20Peter	1	18	And this voice which came from heaven we heard , when we were with him in the holy mount .
BRG	2%20Peter	1	19	We have also a more sure word of prophecy ; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed , as unto a light that shineth in a dark place , until the day dawn , and the day star arise in your hearts :
BRG	2%20Peter	1	20	Knowing this first , that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation .
BRG	2%20Peter	1	21	For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man : but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	2%20Peter	2	2	And many shall follow their pernicious ways ; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of .
BRG	2%20Peter	2	3	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you : whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not , and their damnation slumbereth not .
BRG	2%20Peter	2	4	For if God spared not the angels that sinned , but cast them down to hell , and delivered them into chains of darkness , to be reserved unto judgment ;
BRG	2%20Peter	2	5	And spared not the old world , but saved Noah the eighth person , a preacher of righteousness , bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly ;
BRG	2%20Peter	2	6	And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow , making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly ;
BRG	2%20Peter	2	7	And delivered just Lot , vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked :
BRG	2%20Peter	2	8	( For that righteous man dwelling among them , in seeing and hearing , vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds ; )
BRG	2%20Peter	2	9	The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations , and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished :
BRG	2%20Peter	2	10	But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness , and despise government . Presumptuous are they , selfwilled , they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities .
BRG	2%20Peter	2	11	Whereas angels , which are greater in power and might , bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord .
BRG	2%20Peter	2	12	But these , as natural brute beasts , made to be taken and destroyed , speak evil of the things that they understand not ; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption ;
BRG	2%20Peter	2	13	And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness , as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time . Spots they are and blemishes , sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you ;
BRG	2%20Peter	2	14	Having eyes full of adultery , and that can not cease from sin ; beguiling unstable souls : an heart they have exercised with covetous practices ; cursed children :
BRG	2%20Peter	2	15	Which have forsaken the right way , and are gone astray , following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor , who loved the wages of unrighteousness ;
BRG	2%20Peter	2	16	But was rebuked for his iniquity : the dumb ass speaking with man ’ s voice forbad the madness of the prophet .
BRG	2%20Peter	2	17	These are wells without water , clouds that are carried with a tempest ; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever .
BRG	2%20Peter	2	18	For when they speak great swelling words of vanity , they allure through the lusts of the flesh , through much wantonness , those that were clean escaped from them who live in error .
BRG	2%20Peter	2	19	While they promise them liberty , they themselves are the servants of corruption : for of whom a man is overcome , of the same is he brought in bondage .
BRG	2%20Peter	2	20	For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again entangled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
BRG	2%20Peter	2	21	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than , after they have known it , to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them .
BRG	2%20Peter	2	22	But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb , The dog is turned to his own vomit again ; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	2%20Peter	3	2	That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour :
BRG	2%20Peter	3	3	Knowing this first , that there shall come in the last days scoffers , walking after their own lusts ,
BRG	2%20Peter	3	4	And saying , Where is the promise of his coming ? for since the fathers fell asleep , all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation .
BRG	2%20Peter	3	5	For this they willingly are ignorant of , that by the word of God the heavens were of old , and the earth standing out of the water and in the water :
BRG	2%20Peter	3	6	Whereby the world that then was , being overflowed with water , perished :
BRG	2%20Peter	3	7	But the heavens and the earth , which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men .
BRG	2%20Peter	3	8	But , beloved , be not ignorant of this one thing , that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day .
BRG	2%20Peter	3	9	The Lord is not slack concerning his promise , as some men count slackness ; but is longsuffering to us-ward , not willing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
BRG	2%20Peter	3	10	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night ; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat , the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up .
BRG	2%20Peter	3	11	Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved , what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness ,
BRG	2%20Peter	3	12	Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God , wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved , and the elements shall melt with fervent heat ?
BRG	2%20Peter	3	13	Nevertheless we , according to his promise , look for new heavens and a new earth , wherein dwelleth righteousness .
BRG	2%20Peter	3	14	Wherefore , beloved , seeing that ye look for such things , be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace , without spot , and blameless .
BRG	2%20Peter	3	15	And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you ;
BRG	2%20Peter	3	16	As also in all his epistles , speaking in them of these things ; in which are some things hard to be understood , which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest , as they do also the other scriptures , unto their own destruction .
BRG	2%20Peter	3	17	Ye therefore , beloved , seeing ye know these things before , beware lest ye also , being led away with the error of the wicked , fall from your own stedfastness .
BRG	2%20Peter	3	18	But grow in grace , and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . To him be glory both now and for ever . Amen . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Jude	1	1	Jude , the servant of Jesus Christ , and brother of James , to them that are sanctified by God the Father , and preserved in Jesus Christ , and called :
BRG	Jude	1	2	Mercy unto you , and peace , and love , be multiplied .
BRG	Jude	1	3	Beloved , when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation , it was needful for me to write unto you , and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints .
BRG	Jude	1	4	For there are certain men crept in unawares , who were before of old ordained to this condemnation , ungodly men , turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness , and denying the only Lord God , and our Lord Jesus Christ .
BRG	Jude	1	5	I will therefore put you in remembrance , though ye once knew this , how that the Lord , having saved the people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed them that believed not .
BRG	Jude	1	6	And the angels which kept not their first estate , but left their own habitation , he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day .
BRG	Jude	1	7	Even as Sodom and Gomorrha , and the cities about them in like manner , giving themselves over to fornication , and going after strange flesh , are set forth for an example , suffering the vengeance of eternal fire .
BRG	Jude	1	8	Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh , despise dominion , and speak evil of dignities .
BRG	Jude	1	9	Yet Michael the archangel , when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses , durst not bring against him a railing accusation , but said , The Lord rebuke thee .
BRG	Jude	1	10	But these speak evil of those things which they know not : but what they know naturally , as brute beasts , in those things they corrupt themselves .
BRG	Jude	1	11	Woe unto them ! for they have gone in the way of Cain , and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward , and perished in the gainsaying of Core .
BRG	Jude	1	12	These are spots in your feasts of charity , when they feast with you , feeding themselves without fear : clouds they are without water , carried about of winds ; trees whose fruit withereth , without fruit , twice dead , plucked up by the roots ;
BRG	Jude	1	13	Raging waves of the sea , foaming out their own shame ; wandering stars , to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever .
BRG	Jude	1	14	And Enoch also , the seventh from Adam , prophesied of these , saying , Behold , the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints ,
BRG	Jude	1	15	To execute judgment upon all , and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed , and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him .
BRG	Jude	1	16	These are murmurers , complainers , walking after their own lusts ; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words , having men ’ s persons in admiration because of advantage .
BRG	Jude	1	17	But , beloved , remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ ;
BRG	Jude	1	18	How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time , who should walk after their own ungodly lusts .
BRG	Jude	1	19	These be they who separate themselves , sensual , having not the Spirit .
BRG	Jude	1	20	But ye , beloved , building up yourselves on your most holy faith , praying in the Holy Ghost ,
BRG	Jude	1	21	Keep yourselves in the love of God , looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life .
BRG	Jude	1	22	And of some have compassion , making a difference :
BRG	Jude	1	23	And others save with fear , pulling them out of the fire ; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh .
BRG	Jude	1	24	Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling , and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy ,
BRG	Jude	1	25	To the only wise God our Saviour , be glory and majesty , dominion and power , both now and ever . Amen . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Revelation	17	17	For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will , and to agree , and give their kingdom unto the beast , until the words of God shall be fulfilled .
BRG	Revelation	17	2	With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication , and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication .
BRG	Revelation	17	3	So he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness : and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast , full of names of blasphemy , having seven heads and ten horns .
BRG	Revelation	17	4	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour , and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls , having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication :
BRG	Revelation	17	5	And upon her forehead was a name written , Mystery , Babylon the Great , the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth .
BRG	Revelation	17	6	And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus : and when I saw her , I wondered with great admiration .
BRG	Revelation	17	7	And the angel said unto me , Wherefore didst thou marvel ? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carrieth her , which hath the seven heads and ten horns .
BRG	Revelation	17	8	The beast that thou sawest was , and is not ; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit , and go into perdition : and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder , whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world , when they behold the beast that was , and is not , and yet is .
BRG	Revelation	17	9	And here is the mind which hath wisdom . The seven heads are seven mountains , on which the woman sitteth .
BRG	Revelation	17	10	And there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come ; and when he cometh , he must continue a short space .
BRG	Revelation	17	11	And the beast that was , and is not , even he is the eighth , and is of the seven , and goeth into perdition .
BRG	Revelation	17	12	And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings , which have received no kingdom as yet ; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast .
BRG	Revelation	17	13	These have one mind , and shall give their power and strength unto the beast .
BRG	Revelation	17	14	These shall make war with the Lamb , and the Lamb shall overcome them : for he is Lord of lords , and King of kings : and they that are with him are called , and chosen , and faithful .
BRG	Revelation	17	15	And he saith unto me , The waters which thou sawest , where the whore sitteth , are peoples , and multitudes , and nations , and tongues .
BRG	Revelation	17	16	And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast , these shall hate the whore , and shall make her desolate and naked , and shall eat her flesh , and burn her with fire .
BRG	Revelation	17	18	And the woman which thou sawest is that great city , which reigneth over the kings of the earth . Blue Red and Gold Letter Edition™ Copyright ©

BRG	Revelation	18	10	Standing afar off for the fear of her torment , saying , Alas , alas , that great city Babylon , that mighty city ! for in one hour is thy judgment come .
BRG	Revelation	18	11	And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her ; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more :
BRG	Revelation	18	12	The merchandise of gold , and silver , and precious stones , and of pearls , and fine linen , and purple , and silk , and scarlet , and all thyine wood , and all manner vessels of ivory , and all manner vessels of most precious wood , and of brass , and iron , and marble ,
BRG	Revelation	18	13	And cinnamon , and odours , and ointments , and frankincense , and wine , and oil , and fine flour , and wheat , and beasts , and sheep , and horses , and chariots , and slaves , and souls of men .
BRG	Revelation	18	14	And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee , and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee , and thou shalt find them no more at all .
BRG	Revelation	18	15	The merchants of these things , which were made rich by her , shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment , weeping and wailing ,

BRG	Revelation	18	19	And they cast dust on their heads , and cried , weeping and wailing , saying , Alas , alas , that great city , wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness ! for in one hour is she made desolate .
BRG	Revelation	18	20	Rejoice over her , thou heaven , and ye holy apostles and prophets ; for God hath avenged you on her .
BRG	Revelation	18	21	And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone , and cast it into the sea , saying , Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .
BRG	Revelation	18	22	And the voice of harpers , and musicians , and of pipers , and trumpeters , shall be heard no more at all in thee ; and no craftsman , of whatsoever craft he be , shall be found any more in thee ; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee ;
BRG	Revelation	18	23	And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee ; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee : for thy merchants were the great men of the earth ; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived .
